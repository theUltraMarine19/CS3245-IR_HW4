     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BARR J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: Todd Andrew Lee (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ at the Tamworth District Court on 13 December 2002. Mr Lee pleaded guilty to the offence of Detaining Persons with an Intent to Obtain an Advantage, the advantage being the avoidance of apprehension. That is an offence under s86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act). The maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. At the time of entering his plea, Mr Lee asked his Honour to take account of five further offences on a Form 1. They were all offences committed at the same time as the principal offence. The offences were: 
     
      
    · That he was armed with a Stanley knife, scissors and items he represented as explosives, with the intent of committing an indictable offence, namely, intimidating others (contrary to s33B(1) of the Act). 
     
      
    · That he remained in a building, namely a school classroom, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely, larceny, contrary to s114(1)(d) of the Act. 
     
      
    · That he assaulted three school children, being three counts under s61 of the Act. 
     
      
    3 Taking account of the matters on the Form 1, his Honour imposed a sentence of 6 1/2 years with a non parole period of 3 1/2 years, the sentence to date from his arrest on 9 April 2002.  
     
      
       
      The Offences 
       
      
    4 The applicant was born on 22 February 1971. At the time of these offences he was 31 years old. He lived with his parents at Kootingal, a small town outside Tamworth. He was unemployed. On 9 April 2002 he decided to visit his brother in Tamworth. He packed a bag, expecting that he may stay overnight. He then walked towards the local primary school, hoping to be given a lift to Tamworth on the school bus. 
     
      
    5 Mr Lee was familiar with the layout of the school. At one time he had been employed painting the school. When he got to the school, as he later acknowledged to the police, he saw that the gate was open, and the children in the yard. He entered in the hope that a teacher may have left a handbag in one of the classrooms, and he could steal money. However, whilst in the classroom, a number of children (aged between 10 and 12 years) returned. The school teacher, Ms Anderson, followed. 
     
      
    6 There was a storeroom inside the classroom. Mr Lee retreated to that room and locked the door. He was carrying in his bag some white powder, known as dextrose, used for making beer. He thereafter hatched a plan, which he described to the police in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I had some, some of the dextrose that Dad uses for his, for his home brew, I had some of that so I thought, if I, if I make the teacher scared to come near me, then I can sort of jump the fence and I can be away, sort of thing. But, but then I remembered that I had me bag with me that I was goin' to take to town, so I was, I was pretty well stuck."" 
        
       
      
    7 The applicant emerged from the storeroom holding the white bag which was tied with a string. Ms Anderson provided a statement in which she said that when she first saw Mr Lee she thought he was the handyman. Instead of walking out of the classroom, Mr Lee addressed her saying: 
     
      
       
       ""I'm sorry, you won't be able to leave now."" 
       
      
    8 Ms Anderson asked why, still thinking he was the handyman. Mr Lee responded: 
     
      
       
       ""There are things I have to do. I want you all to stay in here."" 
       
      
    9 It was then that Mr Lee said that he had explosives, namely, the white bag. The powder in the bag was, of course, quite harmless. Ms Anderson moved to the corner of the room with the children. She was alarmed and the children plainly frightened. The applicant said that he had certain ""demands"" that he wished to negotiate. As he made this statement, he placed the bag above the door, describing it as a ""bomb"". He then locked the door. Addressing the children, Mr Lee said that he was not going to hurt them. Not surprisingly the children became upset. Ms Anderson attempted to calm them down. 
     
      
    10 The applicant apparently then became convinced that the children needed drinks. He opened the door and began to bring their schoolbags into the classroom from the veranda. He said to Ms Anderson that the children needed water. She suggested that a student should be released to see the principal to arrange for water. Mr Lee agreed, saying to the child, as he left the classroom: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Go and get water, but if you don't come back, I'm going to cut your teacher's nose off."" 
        
       
      
    11 Whilst the water was being fetched, a number of students knocked on the door, seeking entry to the classroom. Snr Const Wink, in a summary provided to the Court, described what occurred in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""They knocked on the door and the accused opened the door and grabbed a female student by the neck and shoulders and pulled her into the room. He also grabbed a male student and pulled him into the room. The other students ran off and the accused attempted to grab two further male students but they were able to break free and get out of the room. One of the original male students also ran out of the door at this time. The accused shut the door and locked it again."" 
        
       
      
    12 These actions on the part of Mr Lee, gave rise to two of the assault charges on the Form 1. 
     
      
    13 The applicant became very agitated. He pushed a large wooden cabinet in front of the door. He directed students to upturn furniture and pile it in front of the door. 
     
      
    14 The principal of the school then arrived. He spoke to Mr Lee from the verandah, outside the classroom. The applicant said his name was Elvis. He produced from his pocket a Stanley knife, which he had obtained from the storeroom. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am prepared to hurt somebody. I've got the place wired up. I'll tell my demands to a higher authority."" 
        
       
      
    15 The principal arranged for water. Mr Lee grabbed a female student and held a pair of scissors to her side whilst the water was transferred from the verandah into the classroom. He then released the child, and again locked the door. That action was the subject of the further charge of assault on the Form 1. Ms Anderson described the applicant, at this point, as very calm. He poured a cup of water for each child and for her.  
     
      
    16 Ms Anderson and the children had been in the classroom for about twenty minutes when the police arrived. The police spoke to Mr Lee from the verandah. They asked him to open the door and release the children. Mr Lee then moved towards a pair of scissors on the table. A police officer ripped the flyscreen from the window, and entered the room, tackling Mr Lee. Mr Lee was then handcuffed. He still had the Stanley knife in his pocket. 
     
      
    17 Mr Lee was taken to the Tamworth Police Station. The police called members of the Tamworth Mental Health Crisis Team. The team spoke to Mr Lee. They told the police that Mr Lee was probably depressed, but not mentally ill. There was, accordingly, no need for him to be scheduled under the Mental Health Act 1990. Mr Lee later participated in an interview with the police, giving the account set out above. 
     
      
    18 The police statement of the facts included a statement that the teacher and students had all been ""traumatised"" by the incident and that counselling had been arranged. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    19 When the matter proceeded, counsel for the applicant sought to substitute the following grounds of appeal for those which had been formulated in Notice of Appeal. Leave was given. The grounds relied upon were: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to properly take into account the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to properly take into account the applicant's mental disorder. 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: The allowance for the plea of guilty. 
       
      
    20 In the course of his Honour's remarks on sentence he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Finally, I note that from the outset the offender has not sought to excuse his criminal conduct and has co-operated with the investigating police from the time of his arrest and I accept that co-operation and his plea of guilty herein as a genuine sign of his remorse and contrition for his criminal behaviour on this occasion. In these circumstances it seems to me that the subjective material herein together with his plea of guilty entitle him to a discount approximating 20% on the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate in his case."" 
        
       
      
    21 The plea of guilty, as his Honour recognised, had utilitarian value, in saving Court time, and value as a sign of contrition. In respect of the former, the selection of an appropriate discount depended largely upon the timing of the plea (R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, per Spigelman CJ at 419). Here, Mr Lee acknowledged his guilt upon arrest. He pleaded guilty thereafter at the first available opportunity. A conventional figure in such circumstances is 25%. His Honour gave ""approximately 20%"". It is puzzling, according to the applicant, why these facts did not attract the full discount. However, his Honour included in the discount matters which, according to the applicant, ought to have been additional, that is, subjective matters suggesting contrition on the part of Mr Lee. Indeed, according to counsel for the applicant, the Court may infer that the contrition of Mr Lee was the greater (and the utilitarian value to the Crown the more substantial) because the plea avoided the need for the Crown having to call young children in its case. 
     
      
    22 One cannot imagine, however, that the Crown would ever have had in contemplation calling the children who had been detained. The offence had been committed in front of a class teacher. Much of the dialogue had been witnessed by the principal. The closing stages occurred in the presence of the police. 
     
      
    23 His Honour's discount for the plea of ""approximately 20%"" was perhaps lower than one may have expected in the circumstances. However, I do not believe there was error. Nonetheless, if called upon to resentence, I would apply a discount of 25%. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Mental illness. 
       
       
      The applicant had a history of mental illness, induced or exacerbated by drug use and alcohol. He was, as mentioned, 31 years old. He was the youngest of six children. He was described by Dr Nielssen as genetically predisposed towards mental illness. His family had a history of mental illness. His brother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He suffered sexual abuse as a child, at the hands of a neighbour. At an early age he began drinking and taking drugs. He was considered an uncontrollable child, and given permission to leave school early. At the age of 19 he began using heroin, which he continued to use for some years. He was intermittently employed.  
       
      
    24 In 1996 he was admitted to the James Fletcher Psychiatric Hospital at Newcastle. He presented as a voluntary patient, reporting a loss of control. His brother had recently died in a road accident, and his relationship with his girlfriend had terminated soon thereafter. 
     
      
    25 However, his past was not altogether bleak. He managed, without the aid of methadone, to give up heroin, although he substituted other drugs, and especially amphetamines, cannabis and alcohol. He had several long relationships. He had been able to work more or less continuously for five years before an accident on 19 April 2000, when he injured his knee. 
     
      
    26 Mr Lee was given worker's compensation as a result of his knee injury. He ultimately received two substantial payments in respect of the disability which remained. Together they totalled approximately $96,000. The first payment was made in June 2001, and the second in November that year. These payments appear to have been Mr Lee's undoing. In the months that followed, before February 2002, Mr Lee spent the entire amount. When asked how he had spent the money he said, ""drugs, sluts and gambling"". 
     
      
    27 Once the money was gone, Mr Lee, not surprisingly, became depressed. He again resorted to alcohol and various drugs. He was again unemployed. 
     
      
    28 As mentioned, the incident giving rise to the charges occurred on 9 April 2002. One month before (10 March 2002), Mr Lee was admitted once more to the James Fletcher Hospital at Newcastle as a voluntary patient. He remained at that hospital for ten days. He was diagnosed as having an adjustment disorder, suffering from polysubstance abuse and having borderline personality traits. He was discharged after a dispute with the treating doctor.  
     
      
    29 On 22 March 2002, that is after only one day, Mr Lee was again admitted to hospital as a voluntary patient, this time at the Banksia Mental Health Unit at the Tamworth Hospital. He was discharged on 2 April 2002. He was again admitted on 6 April 2002. Whilst at hospital, he climbed onto the roof, holding a scalpel to his throat and threatening to commit suicide unless he received help in respect of the difficulties he was experiencing. He was discharged from hospital on 8 April 2002, that is, the day before the offence. He said he was angry about his discharge. He made the following statement to Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He said that 'I was extremely displeased about being kicked out ... I thought I still needed help'. He said 'they told me I was not mentally ill and they weren't going to keep me in hospital ... I thought I wasn't in control ... I was worried I was going to lash out and hurt myself'."" 
        
       
      
    30 Mr Lee was asked by Dr Nielssen what he meant when, in the course of the incident at the school, he had said that he wished to ""negotiate his demands with a higher authority"". Mr Lee said he could not remember, but he wanted to be taken back to the hospital. 
     
      
    31 His Honour described Mr Lee's behaviour in the course of the incident as ""bizarre"". It certainly was. Instead of quietly leaving the classroom, as might be expected of a rational person, he hatched a plan which can only be described as extraordinary and pointless. Once under arrest, the police, as mentioned, arranged to have him examined by a mental health team. Once brought before the Court, the Magistrate directed that Mr Lee be returned to the Banksia Mental Health Unit. 
     
      
    32 Unquestionably his Honour was conscious of all these matters. The psychiatric evidence was placed before him. He summarised the competing contentions of counsel. The Crown emphasised the objective seriousness of the offences. Counsel for Mr Lee pointed to the impulsive nature of the act and the nature of the act itself. The actions of Mr Lee, it was suggested, were the product of a ""disorganised and confused state of mind"". Counsel for Mr Lee urged that he be dealt with more leniently than might otherwise be the case.  
     
      
    33 Mr Lee had a criminal history. It included Childrens' Court offences and a number of relatively minor offences since becoming an adult. In 1994 he had been placed on a recognisance once in 1994 for break, enter and steal, and in 1998 he had been fined for assaulting a police officer. He had, however, never previously been in custody. Dr Nielssen made the following observation in September 2002: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Lee appeared to have improved considerably after several months institutional care, free from drugs and alcohol and with consistent treatment with antidepressant medication. He would probably receive some benefit from completing the programme offered at the Kevin Waller Unit, a six month group therapy based programme for prisoners with self defeating personality traits considered at risk of self harm. He should also complete a long term residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation programme before his release to the community."" 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Lee also saw a psychologist. He was assessed as having a high average intelligence. It was submitted by Mr Lee's Counsel to the sentencing Judge that Mr Lee's prospects of rehabilitation were reasonably good, a view shared by the Crown. His Honour did not expressly adopt that finding, although he appeared to accept that the prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable, provided Mr Lee maintained his resolve to seek professional help.  
     
      
    35 In the course of his remarks on sentence, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""While the concepts of general and specific deterrence ordinarily play a significant role in determining what sentence to subject an offender to for his objective criminality this case is to my mind an extraordinary case in this regard particularly in light of the offender's bizarre behaviour during the incident, his explanation during the course of the Record of Interview as to how the situation developed and the material contained in the Pre Sentence Report Psychiatric and Psychological Reports which constitute Exhibits C, D, 1 and 2 herein."" 
        
       
      
    36 His Honour made the following observations upon the offence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""On the objective facts of the case this is a most serious offence and in my opinion notwithstanding the subjective material herein falls within the 0 to 65 percentile band of criminality so far as that crime is concerned because it involved the terrorising and traumatising of not less than 10 primary school children and their teacher in circumstances where they were all entitled to feel free and protected and in a safe environment. In these circumstances I (cannot) agree with Mr Parker's contention that the offender's criminality falls in the lower range of criminality for this offence. The trauma that the Principal of the school, the children's teacher and the young children affected by this incident underwent because of the offender's conduct on this occasion cannot be assessed at this time but I have no doubt it will impact on them for some undetermined time into the future."" 
        
       
      
    37 His Honour therefore concluded that the following sentence was appropriate: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In all the circumstances of this case the objective criminality displayed by the offender in committing this offence when viewed in the light firstly of the subjective material placed before me in these proceedings, secondly the fact that he is entitled to a discount on sentence approximating 20%, and thirdly that he will probably have to serve any sentence imposed on him in protective custody, it seems to me that the community's abhorrence to this type of criminal behaviour can only be appeased by my subjecting the offender to a custodial sentence of 6 1/2 years and fixing a non parole period in relation thereto of 3 1/2 years."" 
        
       
      
    38 Now it must be accepted that at the time of committing the offence Mr Lee was not insane. Nonetheless, his history in the months preceding the offence, and especially his admission to psychiatric institutions immediately before the offence, together with his behaviour at the time of the offence, certainly suggested that he was afflicted by mental illness falling short of insanity. 
     
      
    39 The sentencing principle, when dealing with an offender in such circumstances, was stated by Young CJ at and Jenkinson J (with whom Murphy J agreed) in R v Anderson [1981] VR 155 in these terms: (at 160) 
     
      
       
        
        ""General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others. The mental condition of an offender may be taken into account when passing sentence, but whether the evidence establishes legal insanity or mental illness stopping short of legal insanity, the question to be answered is whether the interests of society permit or the interests of the offender require that the sentence to be passed be reduced from what would otherwise be appropriate rather than whether the offender's responsibility for the offence should be regarded as having been reduced."" 
        
       
      
    40 That principle was reaffirmed in R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 at 86 (Clarke JA, Grove and Newman JJ) and Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 (Gleeson CJ, Allen and Sully JJ agreeing at 72).  
     
      
    41 Hunt CJ at CL and Hidden J (with whom Gleeson CJ expressed his general agreement) said much the same thing in R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50/51: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Considerations of general (or even personal) deterrence are not rendered completely irrelevant, and the significance of the offender's mental incapacity is to be weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case. The reason for the principle is that the interests of society do not require such persons to be punished as severely as persons without that disability because such severity is inappropriate to their circumstances. The full understanding of the authority and requirements of the law which is attributed to the ordinary individual of adult intellectual capacities cannot be expected of a person whose intellectual function is insufficient to have that understanding. The means by which the courts give effect to that principle (as an instrument of social administration) is to moderate the consideration of general deterrence to the circumstances of the particular case. But if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation need not be great."" 
        
       
      
    42 In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, Wood CJ at CL said this: (at 394) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing."" 
        
       
      
    43 In R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 Spigelman CJ, applying these principles on a Crown appeal (where a person had pleaded guilty to armed robbery with a blood filled syringe, and had been given a suspended sentence by the sentencing Judge), said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""23. To the extent that mental illness explains the offence - as her Honour found to be the position in the present case - then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions,  
        or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, 
         will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    44 Here his Honour's remarks, in the passage quoted (supra para 34), advert to this principle. I do not doubt that his Honour was conscious of it. The issue is whether there was latent error, as revealed by the length of the sentence. Mr Lee had pleaded guilty. His Honour had allowed a 20% discount, so that his starting point was 8.125 years for an offence in respect of which the maximum was 14 years. On these facts, no valid objection could be made if there were no issue of mental illness. Was it too high, taking account of Mr Lee's mental state at the time, and his capacity to make rational judgments, and taking account of the other aspects of his case, his contrition, his good prospects of rehabilitation, the fact that he had not previously been to gaol and would serve his sentence in protection (because of the nature of the offence)?  
     
      
    45 There is, of course, no doubt that the offence was serious, and the trauma to the children and the teacher was serious, although no-one was physically harmed. I am persuaded, however, that the learned sentencing Judge did err in failing to give proper weight to the mental state of the applicant, such that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. I believe therefore that error has been shown. 
     
      
    46 When resentencing, I would, as I have said, allow 25% for the early plea. I also believe that, with appropriate counselling and arrangements such as those proposed by his Honour, the prospects of Mr Lee's rehabilitation are reasonable. I would, for the same reasons as his Honour, find special circumstances. Mr Lee will benefit from a longer period of supervision than usual. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    47 I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      2. The appeal be allowed. 
       
       
      3. The sentence imposed by Kinchington DCJ on 13 December 2002 be quashed, and in lieu thereof the applicant be resentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years to commence on 9 April 2002 and expire on 8 April 2007, with a non parole period of 2 1/2 years to commence on 9 April 2002 and expire on 8 October 2004. He will be eligible for release on parole on 9 October 2004.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I agree with Newman AJ.2 BARR J: I agree with Newman AJ.3 NEWMAN AJ: This is an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to section 5(d) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against sentences imposed upon the respondent by His Honour Coorey DCJ in the Districts Courts at Campbelltown on the 17th of March 2003.4 The respondent had been indicted on 2 charges of wound with intent to murder pursuant to section 27 of the Crimes Act 1900 and 2 alternative charges of maliciously wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm brought pursuant to section 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. The respondent having pleaded not-guilty to all counts on the indictment, a trial proceeded. In the event the jury found the respondent not-guilty of the 2 counts of wound with intent to murder but guilty of the two alternative counts of maliciously wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 5 At the trial the respondent not only denied that he had committed the acts which were relied upon by the Crown in support of the indictment but also raised self-defence as an issue. Both of these matters were plainly enough rejected by the jury in finding as they did.6 The maximum sentence stipulated by section 33 of the Crimes Act for the crime of maliciously wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm is 25 years’ imprisonment. On both counts His Honour imposed sentences consisting of a head sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months. His Honour ordered that the sentences be served concurrently.7 Before this Court the Crown contended that the sentences imposed by His Honour when considered individually were manifestly inadequate and when looked at from the standpoint of totality of sentence even more so.8 I turn then to the objective facts as found by His Honour.9 On the 22nd of April 2002 the respondent and his brother were present at the Hoyts Cinema Complex at Mount Druitt. Amongst others present at the complex at the time were two other brothers: Ahmed Marnosh Zikria and Mustafa Zikria. At a time when patrons were leaving the cinema a dispute broke out between, inter alia, the Zikria brothers and the respondent. His Honour found, and there was ample evidence to support his finding, that the Zikria brothers particularly Ahmed Marnosh Zikria were the aggressors in the dispute. The respondent produced a handgun and shot both of the Zikria brothers. Ahmed Marnosh Zikria suffered a bullet wound to his right thigh and had bullet fragments lodged in his right leg with small fractures of the upper femur. His brother Mustafa suffered much more serious injuries as a result of being shot by the respondent. His initial gunshot wound was to his epigastric area. When a surgical procedure was carried out upon him at the Nepean Hospital it was found that the bullet had caused a wound to the right lobe of the liver and a wound to the right lower lobe of the right lung. Mustafa Zikria had a stormy recovery which included complications such as a pulmonary embolus, epilepsy and pneumonia. He was hospitalised for 1 month and 6 days and during 2 of the weeks he was in hospital he was in a coma. Plainly enough the wounds suffered by Mustafa Zikria were very life threatening.10 In his remarks on sentence His Honour observed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept the Crown’s submission. I accept Mr Amer’s submission to the extent that the uncontrollable outbursts in Court are clearly consistent with the description of Marnesh on the night of the offence. Mr Amer reiterates that the delay caused by the Crown’s application, although through no fault of the Crown and properly motivated, nevertheless that delay has caused anxiety to the prisoner’s family. The Crown reminded me that the witnesses to the incident gave various descriptions of the assault, beg your pardon of the forcing of the prisoner and his brother down the ramp, the Crown took me through those again this morning. The Crown conceded that there were special circumstances in this matter which would warrant my altering the formula in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that is the sentencing formula. The Crown reminded me that this is the first time the prisoner has been in gaol and of course the evidence clearly shows that he is making good rehabilitative progress and it seems to me the evidence also shows the prisoner needs a lengthy period of supervision when he is released from gaol. I have reflected upon this matter for some time because of the unusual circumstances of the commission of this crime. It seems to me that basically the sentence would have to be slightly above the mid range but I repeat only very slightly above the mid range because of the unusual way in which this crime occurred, namely the vicious and violent attack by the victims upon the prisoner and his young brother. Were it not for those particular facts the sentence formula would be much greater because of the use of a gun. I think that if I was to impose precisely the mid range that I would be in error and that would be unfair to the prisoner because that would expose him to the risk of a Crown appeal. It seems to me the preferable course is to impose a sentence which is slightly above the mid range, it seems to me that I should make a substantial alteration of the sentence, that is the proportion between the non parole and the full term. I accept Mr Amer’s submission that the unusual circumstances of this case do require that I make some adjustment to the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour’s reference to the range of sentences was based upon statistics from the Judicial Commission for the crime of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm which had been tendered by the Crown.12 Putting aside any considerations of totality, in my view His Honour fell into error in sentencing the respondent on each of the separate sentences he passed. In both cases, putting subjective considerations to one side, the appropriate sentences should have been at the high end of the range of sentences applicable in this case. I say this for two reasons. First, both crimes involved the use of a handgun. This is not only an aggravating feature identified by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but also at common law. In my view it is difficult to think of a more serious aggravating feature when dealing with an appropriate sentence for this crime than the use of a handgun. Because the respondent did not give evidence at the trial neither His Honour nor this Court could or can ascribe any reason to the respondent’s actions in bringing a handgun with him to the cinema on the subject night. Second, the wounds suffered by the Zikria brothers, in particular those suffered by Mustafa Zikria, were very serious. Indeed, in the case of Mustafa Zikria the combination of the aggravating feature of the use of a handgun and the severity of the wounds he suffered in my view place the crime committed upon him in the category of the worst type of case. In other words in considering sentence for the wounding of Mustafa Zikria His Honour should have considered imposing the maximum sentence.13 His Honour dealt with the subjective considerations related to the respondent in detail. As no challenge has been mounted to His Honour’s treatment of the subjective considerations I repeat them in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “I turn to subjective considerations. The prisoner is a thirty two year old man who lived with his parents before his incarceration on 5 June 2002. He has legal custody of his eight year old son, the prisoner’s probation and parole officer said that the prisoner and his parents make a positive or rather give the child a positive upbringing. The prisoner does not know the whereabouts of his former wife. The prisoner and his parents migrated to Australia in 1987 when the prisoner was sixteen years of age. The prisoner has been in constant employment since completing the Higher School Certificate in 1988. He worked as a financial consultant from January 2002. He had hopes of becoming a security officer and was pursuing a course in private investigation and security at the time of the commission of the offences. There has been considerable argument on the question of the prisoner’s contrition. Under the heading “attitude to the offence” the author of the pre-sentence report states as follows. He says “the offender agrees with the police facts and he seems to acknowledge the seriousness of the offending behaviour, although he admits the offences occurred, he does not appear to have accepted responsibility for his offending behaviour and does not seem to be aware of the full impact of his actions on the victims. In interviews the offender continually minimised his offences by directing onus on the victims and the threat to himself and his brother. The author is of the view that the prisoner would benefit from anger management programs and or coping in society programs. A report from the area management at Parklea Correctional Centre dates 15 August 2002 stated that “the prisoner has completed a number of courses, including a course in anger management”. I have the benefit of a psychological report from the Parklea Correctional Centre, although the opinion is qualified to some extent, the authors of that report express the opinion that there is a low risk of the prisoner re-offending. The authors recommend the prisoner continues with individual and group counselling to develop the ability to solve his problem. 
         
         
        Their concern is that the prisoner has not displayed an alternative approach to the reaction that he took at the time of the offence. The authors consider that further development of the prisoner’s skills in coping is necessary. I also have the benefit of a report from Carleen(?) Ryder, a psychologist. I note also that the author refers to the fact that the prisoner has a minimal criminal record. The author notes that the “prisoner does not appear to be a dependent drug user and his work history is relatively steady. It would appear that he does not have the obvious risk factors for ongoing criminal behaviour. His behaviour in custody thus far is commendable and he has undertaken employment, study and anger management course. If he undertakes assertiveness training and careers counselling his chances of successfully reintegrating into the community will be improved”. 
         
         
        The prisoner comes from a supportive family. The prisoner’s brother who is a member of the New South Wales police force impressed me in court as a responsible person. The prisoner's brother behaved properly in taking the prisoner and his younger brother to Mount Druitt police station to surrender to police. The prisoner’s father gave evidence on 8 August 2002. The prisoner’s father also impressed me as a supportive person, he is obviously a good father and has been a good father to his four children. He said that he taught his four children to work hard and to study hard. The prisoner’s father has been in Court throughout each day of the proceedings, indeed throughout each day of the trial and throughout each day of the sentence hearing. There is no doubt that the prisoner’s father has been upset by what has happened. Indeed despite the uncontrollable outbursts of the first victim in the trial, the prisoner’s father behaved with dignity and showed no reaction. He struck me as a worthwhile human being. Obviously this has upset him considerably. There is no doubt that the prisoner’s father is well respected in his community. The prisoner’s father told me that the prisoner’s wife left the prisoner and their eight year old son. The prisoner and his son moved into live with his father.” 
        
       
      
    14 The respondent had one entry on his criminal record. That being for common assault. Apparently the events which led to that conviction were as a result of his failed marriage. In my view His Honour rightly did not hold that conviction against the respondent. 15 I turn then to the concept of totality. What His Honour should have done was to determine the appropriate sentence for each offence on the indictment and then arrive at an appropriate sentence to reflect the totality of the criminality by making the individual sentences either concurrent or cumulative: see Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610. In the instant case the Crown Prosecutor conceded that it was appropriate for His Honour to pass concurrent sentences. He did not advert to the principles laid down by the High Court in Pearce. However he did remind His Honour of the concept of totality. He should have alerted His Honour to the fact that his sentence should reflect the objective criminality of both offences. Here the sentences passed do not reflect the serious nature of the crimes committed, involving as they do as they do the shooting of two people.16 As I have already stated, I am of the view that His Honour’s sentences for both crimes were manifestly inadequate. However, of course, the matter does not end there. As Wood J put it in R v Loh 127 A Crim R 577 at 582: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well established the this Court should not interfere with a sentence on a Crown appeal merely because it is of a view that it is less than that which the Court would have itself imposed: see  
        House 
         (1936) 55 CLR 409 at 504; and see also  
        Dinsdale 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; 115 A Crim R 558. 
         
         
        An appellate Court may only interfere if it is shown that the sentencing Judge fell into a material error of law or fact, a test which may be met where the sentence is so far outside a legitimate range of sentencing discretion that error must be assumed, even though it is not otherwise apparent on the face of the reasons for sentence: see  
        Wong 
         (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at 90 per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.” 
        
       
      
    17 It was also put on behalf of the respondent that in view of the concession made by learned Crown Prosecutor that His Honour was entitled to pass concurrent sentences and the fact that he did not remind His Honour precisely of the principles established by the High Court in Pearce, that this Court should exercise its discretion and not interfere. However, as I have already stated, His Honour was alerted to the concept of totality by the learned Crown Prosecutor, and his failure to consider that concept cannot be visited upon the Crown. Accordingly, I would not exercise the Court’s discretion to disallow the appeal on that basis.18 It is also well established that should this Court decide that a sentencing Judge has fallen into an appellable error in an appeal brought pursuant to section 5(d), the Court, applying the principle of double jeopardy will impose a lesser sentence than would have been justified.19 Another matter of challenge to His Honour’s sentence is the fixing of the non-parole period. In both cases His Honour fixed a non-parole period which was 46 per cent of the head sentence. In his remarks on sentence, which I have set out above, it seems that His Honour, in fixing the non-parole period relied not only on special circumstances, (as had been conceded by the Crown to exist in this case), but also upon the actual circumstances of the commission of the offence. As His Honour had already done so when dealing with the head sentence, to repeat the exercise when dealing with a non-parole period seems to me to be a matter of error. I should add that His Honour did not fall into error in finding special circumstances: for instance, a special circumstance here is the fact that this was the first time that the respondent was to serve a term of imprisonment. A non-parole period equivalent to some 60 per cent of the head sentence would have been adequate in the circumstances. In the circumstances, if the sentences were to be concurrent, the head sentence I shall suggest in the case involving Mustafa Zikria would satisfy the concept of totality. The minimum sentences which should have been imposed by His Honour were head sentences of 10 years in relation to the crime involving Ahmed Marnosh Zikria; and 12 years in the crime involving Mustafa Zikria. Taking into account the concept of double jeopardy to which I have already referred, this Court should interfere, and quash the sentences passed by His Honour; imposing in lieu, in the case of Ahmed Marnosh Zikria a head sentence of 8 years, and in the case of the crime involving Mustafa Zikria a head sentence of 10 years. Applying special circumstances and utilising a factor of 60 per cent this would result in a non-parole period in the case of Ahmed Marnosh Zikria of 4 years 9 months and in the case of Mustafa Zikria a non-parole period of 6 years.20 The orders I would propose are as follows:21 1. Appeal upheld;22 2. Sentences imposed by His Honour Judge Coorey on the 17th of March 2003 quashed;23 3. In relation to Count 2 of the indictment, namely the crime of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm involving Ahmed Marnosh Zikria, in lieu substitute a head sentence of 8 years commencing on the 5th of June 2002 and expiring on the 4th of June 2010 with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months commencing on the 5th of June 2002 and expiring on the 4th of March 2007;24 4. In the case of the crime of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm involving Mustafa Zikria, in lieu substitute a head sentence of 10 years commencing on the 5th of June 2002 and expiring on the 4th of June 2012 with a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on the 5th of June 2002 and expiring on the 4th of June 2008.

     REGINA v Phillip Nathan KING 
     
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
       
      The appeal proceeded on an agreed statement of facts. Kylie Flick (the Complainant) and the Respondent engaged in a single act of sexual intercourse with the result that the Complainant became pregnant. The Respondent wished the pregnancy terminated and, when he could neither persuade the Complainant to voluntarily comply nor procure others to attack the Complainant, assaulted the Complainant including kicking her in the stomach and stomping on her stomach about half a dozen times. The Complainant was taken to hospital where an ultrasound was performed. No foetal heartbeat was detected and the foetus was delivered stillborn 3 days later. The pregnancy was between 23 and 24 weeks advanced.  
       
       
      The medical evidence indicated that the death of the foetus was caused by an abruption of the placenta which caused the formation of a retro-placental clot and the exsanguination of the foetus. The Respondent was charged alternatively with the offences of intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm ( 
      Crimes Act  
      1900, s 33) and procuring a miscarriage ( 
      Crimes Act 
       1900, s 83). On the charge of grievous bodily harm, the Crown relied upon the death of the foetus and the abruption of the placenta as constituting grievous bodily harm to the Complainant. The Crown did not rely on any other injuries sustained by the Complainant. The trial judge ordered a permanent stay of the indictment in respect of the s 33 charge on the basis that there was no prospect of the Crown succeeding in obtaining a conviction, as the particulars of the charge could not amount to grievous bodily harm to the mother. The Crown appealed pursuant to s 5F of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912. 
       
       
      HELD 
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Dunford and Adams JJ agreeing) 
       
       
      A. 
       
      An order of permanent stay is an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912. The legislative history of s 5F supports this scope of the jurisdiction.

      R v Lethlean  
      (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 applied.  
      R v Cheng  
      (1999) 48 NSWLR 616 distinguished. 
       
       
      B. 
       
      The prosecution of the appeal is not an abuse of process by the Crown. The alternative avenue available under s5A which provides for Crown appeals after acquittal is not relevant where the Respondent moved for the order of permanent stay. The Respondent’s indication of an intent to plead guilty to the alternative charge is not enforceable and the particular costs regime applicable does not constitute a relevant unfairness. 
       
       
      C. 
       
      There is no authority binding on this Court on the issue of whether the death of a foetus can amount to grievous bodily harm to the mother. Decisions of superior courts in other jurisdictions demonstrate that the answer will turn on the incidents of the particular legal situation under consideration.

      D. 
       
      In the present case, the issue is the scope of the meaning of the word ‘person’ in s 33 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. In the context of harm to a person, the physical connection between the mother and foetus is determinative. The legitimate community concern with violence between persons which gives rise to the aggravated forms of offences of assault is appropriately reflected in the foetus being regarded as part of the mother for the purposes of s 33.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against, what the Appellant contends to be, an interlocutory judgment of her Honour Judge Tupman in the District Court. 
     
      
    2 The Respondent to the appeal was charged with the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm to Kylie Flick with intent to do grievous bodily harm. That is an offence contrary to s33 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    3 The Respondent to the appeal moved by way of Notice of Motion before her Honour for a permanent stay of the proceedings. This was decided as a preliminary issue. On 9 October 2003 her Honour determined that the offence as charged was “doomed to failure”. Accordingly, her Honour made an order that the count under s33 in the indictment be permanently stayed. 
     
      
    4 This appeal raises an important issue of principle. The issue is whether or not the death of a foetus is capable of constituting grievous bodily harm to a pregnant mother. Section 33 emphasises the word “person”, relevantly, where first appearing: 
     
      
       
        
        “33 Whosoever: 
        
       
       
        
        maliciously by any means … inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        with intent … to do grievous bodily harm to any person …  
        
       
       
        
        shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.” 
        
       
       
      The Facts 
       
      
    5 Her Honour had before her an agreed statement of facts and certain medical evidence, which was tendered in the form of statements and an extract from a medical textbook. 
     
      
    6 The Respondent and Ms Flick engaged in a single act of consensual sexual intercourse after which Ms Flick became pregnant. The Respondent sought to persuade Ms Flick to have an abortion, but she refused. The Appellant offered to pay others to assault the complainant, including hitting her in the stomach, but they refused. On 20 August 2002, when the pregnancy was between 23 and 24 weeks, the Respondent attacked Ms Flick. This included kicking her in the stomach and stomping on her stomach about half a dozen times. Ms Flick was taken to Bankstown Hospital immediately, where an ultrasound was performed. No foetal heartbeat was detected. The foetus was delivered stillborn on 23 August 2002. 
     
      
    7 Her Honour referred to the medical evidence, which would be called at trial by the Crown, in the following manner: 
     
      
       
        
        “This evidence would include observations that the placenta when delivered was pale and had a retro-placental clot on its edge measuring 80x20x20 millimetres. Expert opinion evidence would be called by the Crown that the complainant had suffered an abruption of the placenta at the site of this clot. The medical expert would give evidence for the Crown that the foetus had lost its blood or exsanguinated because of the abruption of the placenta. The evidence would further be that the force applied by the accused to the complainant’s abdomen had caused this abruption of the placenta, leading to the demise of the foetus through exsanguination.” 
        
       
      
    8 It was noted that the complainant had certain injuries as a result of the assault. However, it was not suggested that these injuries, which consisted of bruising, could amount to grievous bodily harm. The Crown relied before her Honour, and in this Court, on, alternatively, the death of the foetus and the injury to the placenta as constituting the grievous bodily harm suffered by the Complainant. 
     
      
       
      The Judgment of the Trial Judge 
       
      
    9 Her Honour made the following findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the evidence there is no doubt that there was really serious bodily harm occasioned to the foetus as a result of the accused assaulting the complainant. In very simple terms, the foetus bled to death following the abruption of the placenta and, as I understand the medical evidence, this occurred at the site of the abruption. The foetus was stillborn however and did not take a breath outside the uterus.” 
        
       
       
      And  
       
       
        
        “The placenta too suffered some injury on the evidence before me. As I understand the medical evidence, that injury amounted to a portion of it detaching from the uterine wall, allowing the loss of foetal blood into the mother’s blood stream and ultimately causing the retro-placental clot noted on delivery. The evidence would not allow me to determine whether that injury to the placenta alone is capable of amounting to really serious bodily harm. It seems to me, however, that this is not an issue on this Notice of Motion seeking permanent stay because that issue, if the only issue for determination, would ultimately be a matter for a jury to decide if in fact it was otherwise appropriate for the trial on this count to proceed.” 
        
       
      
    10 Her Honour referred to the decision of the House of Lords in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994) [1998] AC 245 as authority for the proposition that a foetus was a “unique organism” and as having overruled earlier authority that a foetus was an integral and inseparable part of the mother. Her Honour further indicated: 
     
      
       
        
        “That approach it seems to me, although not in relation to the law of homicide but in relation to the New South Wales provisions as they then existed relating to culpable driving, was adopted and followed in  
        R v F  
        (1993) 40 NSWLR 245, a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
        
       
      
    11 Her Honour referred to and distinguished judgments in Canada and in New Zealand but observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I understand it there is no authority with the exception of  
        R v F  
        binding on me in relation to this issue.  
        R v F,  
        I accept, to an extent is peculiar to the then existing provisions of s52A of the  
        Crimes Act  
        and the crime of culpable driving.” 
        
       
      
    12 Her Honour posed the issue in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that only if the foetus and placenta in the case before me are capable at law of being regarded as part of the mother can the Crown ever succeed in count 1.” 
        
       
      
    13 Her Honour went on to discuss the injury to the placenta in the following manner: 
     
      
       
        
        “The only evidence I have in relation to the status of the placenta is the limited textbook reference to which I have referred. It is necessary for me to look to this issue because that is one of the particulars provided by the Crown in relation to the element of grievous bodily harm, namely the abruption of the placenta. As I understand the evidence before me the placenta is not part of [the] body of the mother but rather the mother’s bloodstream to that of the foetus. It attaches to the uterus and it is through that attachment that the blood flows to and from the foetus. As I understand the evidence, it was a small section of that attachment to the uterine wall which was ruptured as a result of the flows to the victim’s abdomen and it was via that detached section that the foetal blood flowed back into the bloodstream of the mother, ultimately leading to the demise of the foetus. Again, as I understand the evidence, the placenta s formed at a time shortly after conception when the fertilised ovum attaches to the uterine wall. It cannot, as I understand it, exist independently of the foetus and only exists for the benefit of the foetus. There is no expert evidence otherwise in relation to the nature of the placenta and on the basis of that limited evidence and understanding it seems to me that the placenta cannot be viewed as being part of the body of the mother. As such the injury to the placenta cannot it seems to me on the evidence before me be construed as bodily harm to the mother.” 
        
       
      
    14 Her Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me on the basis of the authorities to which I have referred and applying the logic in particular applied by the House of Lords in  
        Attorney Generals Reference No 3 (of 1994)  
        and the Court of Criminal Appeal in New South Wales in  
        R v F,  
        that the Crown in this case cannot succeed on count 1 because it could never prove that the demise of the foetus itself and/or the abruption of the placenta amounted to grievous bodily harm to the complainant Kylie Flick and for that reason I propose to grant a permanent stay of count 1.” 
        
       
       
      Jurisdictional Challenge 
       
      
    15 The first issue that needs to be addressed is the challenge by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of this Court under s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That section relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “5F(2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.” 
        
       
      
    16 On this issue, the Respondent referred the Court to R v Cheng (1999) 48 NSWLR 616 where this Court determined that the words “interlocutory judgment or order” in s5F(2) cannot be interpreted as extending to a direction to acquit by a trial judge. Accordingly there was no right of appeal under s5F(2) from the decision of a trial judge that there was no case to answer, leading to the inevitable consequence of a direction to the jury to acquit. The reasoning of this Court was based on the “close relationship” between the decision sought to be challenged and a verdict of an acquittal (see at [19] and [32]-[34]). 
     
      
    17 Mr C Steirn SC, who appeared for the Respondent, submitted that the order for a permanent stay was in effect a final order and therefore s5F had no application. He submitted that the relationship between an order for a permanent stay and a verdict of acquittal was as close as the relationship between the decision to direct a verdict of acquittal and the actual acquittal considered in Cheng. 
     
      
    18 In my opinion this submission should be rejected. An order for a permanent stay is not equivalent to a decision to direct a verdict of acquittal. In Cheng, the decision was made in the course of a trial. An acquittal was an inevitable consequence of the decision. A stay does not lead to an acquittal under any circumstances. There has been no trial. 
     
      
    19 By reason of the Notice of Motion instituted by the Respondent before the trial judge, there was no prospect of an acquittal. There was, accordingly, no infringement of the principle that the Crown does not have a right of appeal from an acquittal which was applied by this Court in Cheng. 
     
      
    20 The issue of whether or not a stay constitutes an interlocutory judgment or order has frequently arisen in civil litigation in the context of whether leave is necessary before an appeal can be instituted. Sometimes the answer has been yes and sometimes no. (See Tampion v Anderson (1973) 48 ALJR 11; Licul v Corney (1976) 180 CLR 213 at 219-220;  Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (No 1) (1980) 147 CLR 35 at 38; Hi-Fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No 3) (1998) 86 FCR 374; Little v Victoria [1998] 4 VR 596; Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, The Doctrine of Res Judicata, (3rd ed by the Hon K R Handley) (1996) at [172].) This line of authority was not relied upon in the course of this case. In any event, the issue arises in the particular context of s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    21 I note that the effect of the Respondent’s contentions would not be that there could be no appeal from the judgment of Tupman DCJ. By leave, an appeal could lie to the Court of Appeal (see s127(2)(a) of the District Court Act 1973). It is obviously desirable to avoid duplication of proceedings. Where a jurisdictional challenge is made to the Court of Criminal Appeal hearing a matter under a provision such as s5F, it is desirable for an appellant to consider instituting a precautionary application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. As Chief Justice I am in a position to ensure that both applications are heard simultaneously by the same bench (see s36(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1970). 
     
      
    22 The legislative history of s5F indicates that it was designed to ensure that the proliferation of stay applications, which bedevilled the administration of justice in this State during the course of the 1980s, should be transferred from the Court of Appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal (see R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213 at 217-219; R v Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 at 199). The grant or refusal of applications for a permanent stay was, given this legislative background, intended by the Parliament to fall within the meaning of the words “interlocutory judgment or order” in s5F. 
     
      
       
      Discretion 
       
      
    23 In the alternative to the jurisdictional point Mr Steirn SC submitted that this Court should refuse to permit the Crown to prosecute the appeal or refuse relief on the appeal, on the basis that it constitutes an abuse of process or would constitute an abuse unless certain conditions were met. 
     
      
    24 This submission was first based on the provisions of s5A of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which create a regime by which a question of law can be referred to this Court where a person tried on indictment has been acquitted. Mr Steirn SC points out that by reason of s5A(2)(d), any answer to the question of law so submitted would not affect or invalidate the verdict of acquittal. 
     
      
    25 If there had been a trial and a verdict of acquittal had been entered then, no doubt, this would have been the appropriate way in which the question of law of broader significance could have been referred to this Court by the Director of Public Prosecutions. However there was no acquittal. The reason why there was no acquittal was because the now Respondent, who asks this Court to exercise a discretion in his favour, chose to pursue the proceedings in a particular manner, that is, by asking for a permanent stay. The fact that, if an alternative route had been chosen, the Respondent may have had the benefit of an acquittal, is not, in my opinion, a basis for the Court exercising a discretion in favour of the Respondent in this regard. 
     
      
    26 I note that in the course of the submissions to this Court, counsel for the Respondent repeated the submission made to Tupman DCJ that it was the intention of the Respondent to plead guilty to an alternative charge under s83 of the Crimes Act 1900. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “83 Whosoever: 
        
       
       
        
        unlawfully administers to, or causes to be taken by, any woman, whether with child or not, any drug or noxious thing, or 
        
       
       
        
        unlawfully uses any instrument or other means,  
        
       
       
        
        with intent in any such case to procure her miscarriage, shall be liable to imprisonment for ten years.” 
        
       
      
    27 As noted the maximum sentence for the charge under s33 is twenty-five years imprisonment.  
     
      
    28 The alternative charge is based on the assumption that attacking someone with fists or feet is “other means” within the meaning of s83. It is by no means clear to me that this mechanism of causing miscarriage is something which somebody can “use”. It is at least arguable that s83 is concerned with administration of chemical substances and the application of physical implements of some character.  
     
      
    29 The indication by the Respondent that he intends to plead guilty to this alternative charge is not something to which the Respondent can be held. Indeed, even after a plea and conviction there are circumstances in which a conviction will be set aside, notwithstanding the plea. Those circumstances are more restrictive than is presently the case with respect to a mere statement of an intention. This, again, is a manifestation of the difference between an application for a stay of proceedings and the results of an actual trial. 
     
      
    30 It was also submitted that the Court should not permit the Crown to prosecute the appeal in the absence of an undertaking, on the part of the Crown, to pay the costs of representation of the Respondent by junior and senior counsel. This submission proceeded on the assumption that the Respondent would be entitled to receive payment pursuant to s6C of the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951, albeit one limited to the amount of $10,000. 
     
      
    31 The submission was that it would be unfair to require the Respondent to proceed subject to such a limitation in view of the complexity of the issue raised and the desirability of senior and junior counsel being briefed, as acknowledged to the Respondent in correspondence on the part of the Appellant. 
     
      
    32 The principal point in issue is in a narrow compass. The authorities are few. It does require research in the preparation of the written submissions on the substantive issue. However, there are a number of matters which the Respondent has, unsuccessfully, sought to raise. The main issue is not of such a wide ranging character as to conclude that $10,000 is so wholly disproportionate to constitute unfairness of a degree which would justify the Court refusing to allow the Crown to prosecute the appeal. 
     
      
    33 On the basis, to which I will now turn, that her Honour erred in her reasoning on the substantive issue, I do not see any proper basis on which the Court should exercise a discretion to refuse to intervene or to do so only on terms. 
     
      
       
      Issue on the Appeal 
       
      
    34 The Appellant submitted that her Honour erred in her consideration of the judgment of this Court in R v F (1993) 40 NSWLR 245. The references in her Honour’s judgment, which I have quoted above, indicated that her Honour regarded R v F as an authority binding on her and that it had adopted, for purposes of another section of the Crimes Act, the analysis of the House of Lords decision in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994). The Appellant pointed out that the actual reference in R v F to the case of Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994) was a reference to the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1996] QB 581) that was overturned by the House of Lords. Indeed, the judgment of this Court in R v F preceded the judgment of the House of Lords in that case. Furthermore, it was submitted, that nothing in R v F directed attention to the issue before her Honour and that the reference to the English case was on a different point. 
     
      
    35 The submissions of the Crown in this regard are correct. Nothing in R v F constituted an adoption by this Court of the approach to the question which later found favour with the House of Lords. This was not an issue before the Court in R v F. Nothing said by this Court adopted the subsequent reasoning of the House of Lords. 
     
      
    36 There are, as will be seen, divergent approaches to this issue taken in the relevant authorities in England, Canada and New Zealand. The determination of the Australian position in this regard is open to this Court. There is no authority binding on this Court. 
     
      
    37 The issue that arises is to be determined as a matter of statutory construction of s33 of the Crimes Act 1900 set out above. The primary issue is whether the actus reus of the offence under s33 is made out when injury is inflicted upon a foetus resulting in death and the charge asserts that the “person” so attacked is the mother. To put the issue another way, do the words “upon any person” encompass the foetus as part of the mother, for purposes of the word “person” where first appearing in s33? 
     
      
       
      The Relevant Case Law 
       
      
    38 The first authority is the Canadian case of R v Sullivan & Lemay (1986) 31 CCC (3d) 62. It went on appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia (R v Sullivan & Lemay (1989) 31 BCLR (2d) 145) and to the Supreme Court of Canada (R v Sullivan & Lemay [1991] 1 SCR 489; (1991) 63 CCC (3d) 97). 
     
      
    39 The case involved alleged offences against two provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada: 
     
      
       
        
        “203 Everyone who by criminal negligence causes death to another person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life. 
        
       
       
        
        204 Everyone who by criminal negligence causes bodily harm to another person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.” 
        
       
      
    40 The case involved two midwives who had assisted in a home birth. After many hours of labour the head of the baby was delivered but contractions ceased. The midwives were unable to complete the delivery. Emergency services were called but by the time the baby was taken to the hospital and finally delivered by an intern, it showed no signs of life. 
     
      
    41 The trial judge, sitting at first instance without a jury, found that a full term child which was in the process of being born is a “person” within the meaning of s203. Accordingly she convicted on that count. She went on to acquit on count 2. With respect to that count, the Crown did not rely on death of the child as the relevant “bodily harm” for purposes of s204 of the Criminal Code. (See 31 CCC supra at [66].) It was an additional rather than an alternative charge. The trial judge found that the relevant injuries relied upon by the Crown did not constitute bodily harm within the meaning of the provision. She added, however: 
     
      
       
        
        “[68] I should comment that, had I reached the opposite conclusion with respect to the ‘persons’ argument above, then I would have found the accused guilty on this count, because I would have concluded that the child was a part of Jewel Voth at the time of its death.” 
        
       
      
    42 On appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, the appellate court came to a different conclusion on the first count. It held that a child not completely born was not considered a person in accordance with the common law of Canada. The word “person” in s203 of the Criminal Code did not extend to a foetus which was not fully born. However the Court of Appeal substituted a conviction on the second count. 
     
      
    43 The Court of Appeal applied the logic of its decision for allowing the appeal with respect to count 1 to count 2, when it said at 162: 
     
      
       
        
        “From the conclusion that the line of demarcation as a matter of law is live birth, in our opinion, for the purposes of count 2, the child when it is in the birth canal remains part of the mother, as a matter of law.” 
        
       
      
    44 On appeal the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the Court of Appeal with respect to count 1. The appeal, however, was allowed because there was, in fact, no Crown appeal against the acquittal and, save in certain circumstances identified in Canadian authority, an appellate court should not substitute a conviction for an acquittal on any count, by reason of particular provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada. 
     
      
    45 However, in the course of giving his reasons for reaching this conclusion Chief Justice Lamer said at 506: 
     
      
       
        
        “I respectfully disagree with the Crown’s assertion that Sullivan and Lemay could not have been convicted on both counts in this case. The trial judge explicitly considered whether Jewel Voth had suffered bodily harm (independent of the death of the foetus) and concluded that she had not. Had the trial judge made a different finding of fact, she may well have convicted Sullivan and Lemay on both counts. Furthermore, even if no independent bodily harm was found to have occurred it will still not be  
        impossible  
        for Sullivan and Lemay to have been convicted on both counts. It would not have been illogical to find that bodily harm was done to Jewel Voth through the death of the foetus which was inside of and connected to her body and, at the same time, to find that the foetus was a person who could be the victim of criminal negligence causing death.” 
        
       
      
    46 In Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994) the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords had before them a reference on a point of law after a murder accused was acquitted by direction of the trial judge. The facts in that case were that the respondent had stabbed his girlfriend who was, to his knowledge, pregnant with his child. The stab wounds included wounds which penetrated the uterus and the abdomen of the foetus. The injury to the foetus was not detected. The child was born grossly premature and survived for about 120 days. The issue before the court concerned the proceedings against the respondent for murder of the child. 
     
      
    47 In the course of dealing with a submission by defence counsel that an act causing death of the foetus was not itself an unlawful act, such an act being one the elements required to establish murder, Lord Chief Justice Taylor, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at 591G: 
     
      
       
        
        “He argues that since the foetus has no separate existence, causing an injury to it is not unlawful unless it comes within the scope of one of the statutory offences such as child destruction or abortion. We reject that submission. In law the foetus is treated as a part of the mother until it has a separate existence of its own. Thus to cause injury to the foetus is just as unlawful as any assault upon any other part of the mother.” 
        
       
      
    48 His Lordship repeated this approach when dealing with the element of mens rea for murder when he said at 593G: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the eyes of the law the foetus is taken to be a part of the mother until it has an existence independent of the mother. Thus an intention to cause serious bodily injury to the foetus is an intention to cause serious bodily injury to a part of the mother just as an intention to injure her arm or her leg would be so viewed. Thus a consideration of whether a charge of murder can arise where the focus of the defendant’s intention is exclusively the foetus falls to be considered under the head of transferred malice as is the case where the intention is focused exclusively or partially upon the mother herself.” 
        
       
      
    49 His Lordship went on to consider the concept of transferred malice. He concluded at 594E-G: 
     
      
       
        
        “We can see no reason to hold that malice can only be transferred where the person to whom it is transferred was in existence at the time of the act causing death. It is perhaps pertinent to observe that a sufficient intention may be directed at no individual but rather there may be an indiscriminate intention which will suffice. Thus a defendant who introduces poison into baby food on a supermarket shelf with an intention to kill some wholly unidentified child is clearly guilty of murder if a child later dies from eating the poisoned food. It would be a remarkable state of affairs if such a person was only guilty of murder if a child had already been born at the date when the poison was introduced to the food. If in such cases of general malice, there is no requirement that the child should already been born, it is not easy to see why there should be a distinction drawn when malice is instead transferred from an intended victim to an unintended one.” 
        
       
      
    50 The first question contained in the reference from the Attorney-General was: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Subject to proof by the prosecution of the requisite intent in either case: whether the crimes of murder or manslaughter can be committed where unlawful injury is deliberately inflicted: (i) to a child in utero, (ii) to a mother carrying a child in utero, where the child is subsequently born alive, enjoys an existence independent of the mother, thereafter dies and the injuries inflicted while in utero either caused or made a substantial contribution to the death.” 
        
       
      
    51 The answer given by the Court of Appeal to this question was:  
     
      
       
        
        “Yes. Murder or manslaughter can be committed where unlawful injury is deliberately inflicted either to a child in utero or to a mother carrying a child in utero in the circumstances postulated in the question. The requisite intent to be proved in the case of murder is an intention to kill or cause really serious bodily injury to the mother, the foetus before birth being viewed as an integral part of the mother. Such intention is appropriately modified in the case of manslaughter.” 
        
       
      
    52 On appeal to the House of Lords, the House refused to answer that part of the question identified as part (i), i.e. where unlawful injury is deliberately inflicted to a child in utero. It did this because it said that this issue did not arise at the trial (see at 265-266 and 274). The child was not the object of the attack and the accused had no intent to kill, or to do serious harm, to any person other than the pregnant woman. He did not intend to cause any harm to the foetus. The issue that arises in this case was precisely the issue not answered by the House of Lords in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994).  
     
      
    53 The judgments in the House of Lords concentrated on the issue of an unlawful injury directed to the mother alone, with the intention of hurting the mother alone (see e.g. at 253B). It was in the course of considering this question that Lord Mustill said at 255C-G: 
     
      
       
        
        “The decision of the Court of Appeal found that on the proposition that the foetus is part of the mother, so that an intention to cause really serious bodily injury to the mother is equivalent to the same intent directed towards the foetus … I must dissent from this proposition for I believe it to be wholly unfounded in fact. Obviously, no-one would assert that once M had been delivered of S, the baby and her mother were in any sense ‘the same’. Not only were they physically separate, but they were each unique human beings and no doubt with many features of resemblance. The reason for the uniqueness of S was that the development of her own special characteristics has been enabled and bounded by the collection of genes handed down not only by M but also by the natural father. This collection was different from the genes which had enabled and bounded the development of M, for these had been handed down by her own mother and natural father. S and her mother were closely related but, even apart from differing environmental influences, they were not, had not been, and in the future never would be ‘the same’. There was, of course, an intimate bond between the foetus and the mother, created by the total dependence of the foetus on the protected physical environment furnished by the mother, and on the supply by the mother through the physical linkage between them of the nutrients, oxygen and other substances essential to foetal life and development. The emotional bond between the mother and her unborn child was also of a very special kind. But the relationship was one of bond, not of identity. The mother and the foetus were two distinct organisms living symbiotically, not a single organism with two aspects. The mother’s leg was part of the mother; the foetus was not.”  
        
       
      
    54 His Lordship went on to say at 256B-D: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would therefore, reject the reasoning which assumes that since (in the eyes of English law) the foetus does not have the attributes which make it a ‘person’ it must be an adjunct of the mother. Eschewing all religious and political debate I would say that the foetus is neither. It is a unique organism. To apply to such an organism the principles of a law evolved in relation to autonomous beings is bound to mislead. I prefer, so far as binding authority permits, to start afresh …” 
        
       
      
    55 His Lordship went on to determine the appropriate approach, limited to the crime of murder. He referred to the long established rules that an intent to cause grievous bodily harm will found a conviction of murder and the inappropriateness of developing the law in a new direction based on that traditional rule. His Lordship also considered the rule of “transferred malice” but again found reasons for restricting its application. His Lordship concluded at 261-262: 
     
      
       
        
        “My Lords, the purpose of this inquiry has been to see whether the existing rules are based on principles sound enough to justify their extension to a case where the defendant acts without an intent to injure either the foetus or the child which it will become. In my opinion they are not. To give an affirmative answer requires a double ‘transfer’ of intent: first from the mother to the foetus and then from the foetus to the child as yet unborn. Then one would have to deploy the fiction (or at least the doctrine) which converts an intention to commit serious harm into the mens rea of murder. For me, this is too much. If one could find any logic in the rules I would follow it from one fiction to another, but whatever grounds there may once have been have long since disappeared. I am willing to follow old laws until they are overturned, but not to make a new law on a basis for which there is no principle.” 
        
       
      
    56 Lord Hope of Craighead said at 267D-G: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court of Appeal held that a foetus before birth must be taken to be an integral part of the mother, in the same way as her arm or her leg. It was for this reason that they said that the requisite intent to be proved in the case of murder, if a child was subsequently born alive and then died, was an intention to kill or to cause really serious bodily injury to the mother. I am not satisfied that this is the correct approach. The creation of an embryo from which a foetus is developed requires the bringing together of genetic material from the father as well as from the mother. The science of human fertilisation and embryology has now been developed to the point where the embryo may be created outside the mother and then placed inside her as a live embryo. This practice, not now uncommon in cases of infertility … serves to remind us that an embryo is in reality a separate organism from the mother in the moment of its conception. Its individuality is retained by it throughout its development until it achieves an independent existence on being born. So the foetus cannot be regarded as an integral part of the mother in the sense indicated by the Court of Appeal, notwithstanding its dependence upon the mother for its survival until birth.”  
        
       
      
    57 The House of Lords answered the first question, with respect to murder, in the negative, i.e. that the crime of murder was not committed in the circumstances posed in (ii) of the question. However, it answered the question with respect to manslaughter in the opposite way, i.e. that the circumstances were capable of constituting manslaughter.  
     
      
    58 As Lord Hope of Craighead said at 268F-G: 
     
      
       
        
        “The mental element which is required to establish the crime of manslaughter is different from that which is required for murder. The difference may be regarded as one of degree where there is only one victim of the criminal act done by the defendant, and he intended to cause harm to the victim. In that case the only issue is whether the crime is that of murder or of manslaughter. But in the present case, where there were two alleged victims – the mother who was stabbed, to whom B intended to cause harm, and the child who was born later and then died, to whom no harm was intended – the question is not simply one of degree. An analysis is needed of the nature of the intention which requires to be established in the case of each of these two crimes.” 
        
       
      
    59 His Lordship concluded that the position with respect to manslaughter was different to that with respect to murder. He noted that the crime of manslaughter can be committed even though a defendant did not intend to injure the deceased. This encompasses death as a result of gross negligence or arising from an unlawful and dangerous act. In this context his Lordship said at 270G-H: 
     
      
       
        
        “[I]t is unnecessary to prove that he knew that his act was likely to injure the person who died as a result of it. All that need be proved is that he intentionally did what he did, that the death was caused by it and that, applying an objective test, all sober and reasonable people would recognise the risk that some harm would result.” 
        
       
      
    60 His Lordship concluded at 274D-G: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think, then, that the position can be summarised in this way. The intention which must be discovered is an intention to do an act which is unlawful and dangerous. In this case the act which had to be shown to be an unlawful and dangerous act was the stabbing of the child’s mother. There can be no doubt that all sober and reasonable people would regard that act, within the appropriate meaning of this term, as dangerous. It is plain that it was unlawful as it was done with the intention of causing her injury. As B intended to commit that act, all the ingredients necessary for mens rea in regard to a crime of manslaughter were established, irrespective of who was the ultimate victim of it. The fact that the child whom the mother was carrying at the time was born alive and then died as a result of the stabbing is all that was needed for the offence of manslaughter when actus reus for that crime was completed by the child’s death. The question, once all the other elements are satisfied, is simply one of causation. The defendant must accept all the consequences of his act, so long as the jury are satisfied that he did what he did intentionally, that what he did was unlawful and that, applying the correct test, it was also dangerous. The death of the child was unintentional, but the nature and quality of the act which caused it was such that it was criminal and therefore punishable. In my opinion that is sufficient for the offence of manslaughter. There is no need to look to the doctrine of transferred malice for a solution to the problem raised by this case so far as manslaughter is concerned.” 
        
       
      
    61 In R v F this Court considered a question of law submitted by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s5A(2)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That question was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Is a child in utero who is injured through impact with a motor vehicle or through impact with any object of a motor vehicle in or on which that child in utero was being conveyed, is subsequently born, lives independently and then dies as a result of the injuries sustained, a person for the purposes of s52A of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900?” 
        
       
      
    62 The basic factual situation can be seen to be similar to that considered in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994). A distinctive feature was that s52A of the Crimes Act did not require an intent to inflict death or grievous bodily harm. The introductory words, relevantly for present purposes, of s52A(1) are: “where the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, any person is occasioned through … impact etc.” The trial judge had held that a child, whose pregnant mother was injured in the accident and who was subsequently born but died as a result of injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident, was not a “person” within the meaning of this provision.  
     
      
    63 In its reasons for deciding that the question posed for its consideration should be answered in the affirmative, the Court relied on the line of authority at common law to the effect that where an unborn child receives injuries, is born alive but dies of those antenatal injuries, the perpetrator may be found guilty of homicide (see at 247C-G). It is in the context of accepting that common law principle that the judgment of Grove J, with whom McInerney and Hulme JJ agreed, referred to the Court of Appeal decision in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994). By the application of this line of authority, Grove J concluded at 248B-C that, subject to the condition that the baby in utero is born alive, the baby is a “person” within the meaning of s52A(1)(a). 
     
      
    64 It should be noted that the offence under s52A is committed when either death or grievous bodily harm is occasioned to “any person”. This is the same formula as is contained in s33 of the Act. However, the reasoning in R v F is not directed to the issue now before the Court, i.e. whether the foetus is part of the “person” of the mother at the time of the injury. 
     
      
    65 The Supreme Court of Canada returned to the issue of the relationship of a foetus and a mother in a civil legal context in Winnipeg Child & Family Services (Northwest Area) v G [1997] 3 SCR 925. The issue was whether the law of torts or the parens patriae jurisdiction of the court permit an order detaining a pregnant woman against her will, to protect her unborn child from conduct that may harm the child (see at [9]). 
     
      
    66 McLachlin J, as her Ladyship then was, delivered the judgment of the majority. Her Ladyship indicated at [12]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he issue is not one of biological status, nor indeed spiritual status, but of legal status.” 
        
       
      
    67 She went on to quote at [12] from the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Tremblay v Daigle [1989] 2 SCR 530: 
     
      
       
        
        “The task of properly classifying a foetus in law and in science are different pursuits. Ascribing personhood to a foetus in law is a fundamentally normative task. It results in the recognition of rights and duties – a matter which falls outside the concerns of scientific classification. In short, this court’s task is a legal one. Decisions based upon broad social, political, moral and economic choices are more appropriately left to the legislature.” 
        
       
      
    68 McLachlin J went on to note the line of authority in Canada which had acknowledged that injury to a foetus was actionable in negligence, but that the right to sue did not arise until the infant was born (at [13]). Her Ladyship also referred to Australian cases to the same effect (Watt v Rama [1972] VR 353). 
     
      
    69 In the course of her reasoning her Ladyship said at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before birth the mother and unborn child are one in the sense that ‘the life of the foetus is intimately connected with, and cannot be regarded in isolation from, the life of the pregnant woman’.”  
        
       
       
      She referred to  
      Paton v United Kingdom 
       (1980) 3 EHRR 408 (Comm.) at 415 as applied in 
       In re F (in utero) 
       [1988] 2 WLR 1288. 
       
      
    70 In the course of her reasoning rejecting the tort law basis for the suggested power, her Ladyship said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[29] To permit an unborn child to sue its pregnant mother-to-be would introduce a radically new conception into the law; the unborn child and its mother as separate juristic persons in a mutually separable and antagonistic relation. Such a legal conception, moreover, is belied by the reality of the physical situation; for practical purposes, the unborn child and its mother-to-be are bonded in a union separable only by birth.” 
        
       
      
    71 This passage may be seen as rejecting the analysis of a separate genetic bundle, which was influential in the reasoning of Lords Mustill and Hope in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994). 
     
      
    72 The Court rejected the proposition that a pregnant woman had a duty of care to a foetus which could be breached by lifestyle choices such as alcohol consumption, drug abuse and poor nutrition. The Court also rejected the submission that the court’s parens patriae jurisdiction permitted protection of unborn children. 
     
      
    73 There is a long line of authority that, for purposes of the civil law including the parens patriae jurisdiction and the law of torts, the position is as stated by Sir George Baker in Paton v British Pregnancy Advisory Service Trustees [1979] QB 276 at 279D: 
     
      
       
        
        “The foetus cannot, in English law, in my view, have a right of its own at least until it is born and has a separate existence from its mother. That permeates the whole of the civil law of this country (I except the criminal law, which is now irrelevant) …”  
        
       
       
      (See also  
      C v S  
      [1988] QB 135 at 140;  
      Paton v UK 
      ;

      at 1299-1300 and 1302-1303;  
      Attorney-General (Qld) v T  
      (1983) 57 ALJR 285 at 286.) 
       
      
    74 In Harrild v Director of Proceedings [2003] 3 NZLR 289 an issue about the relationship between a foetus and a mother arose in the civil context of the particular statutory regime for compensation for personal injury in New Zealand. The issue was whether or not harm to a foetus was harm to the mother for the purposes of the no fault accident compensation legislation applicable in that country. If it were not, then the mother had not suffered personal injury and accordingly could not claim under that legislation.  
     
      
    75 A statutory office holder, called the Director of Proceedings, brought proceedings under the Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994 (NZ) on behalf of the parents of a stillborn child alleging that the medical specialist, Dr Harrild, was in breach of the relevant Code in that he provided inadequate medical service which resulted in the death of a foetus. In the Tribunal and court below, the Director succeeded in pursuing a claim for damages under that Act on the basis that harm to the foetus was distinct from harm to the mother and, accordingly, that the mother had suffered no personal injury. A claim under the particular statutory regime could not be made if the claim arose “directly or indirectly out of” a “personal injury” suffered, relevantly, by the mother. 
     
      
    76 Elias CJ emphasised at [15] the particular statutory framework in which the issue arose and that care had to be taken with the application of reasoning from other cases, such as those dealing with criminal assaults. Her Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[20] I do not think the answer to the appeal turns upon questions such as whether an unborn child itself is a person in law and has cover under the  
        Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act  
        or whether it is biologically ‘the same’ as the mother or whether it is a distinct organism. As Lord Mustill pointed out in  
        Attorney-General’s Reference  
        at p256, a foetus is not an ‘autonomous being’. Application of legal principles developed in relation to autonomous beings is ‘bound to mislead’. That did not mean in the application of the criminal law in that case that its existence as a ‘unique organism’ was to be ignored. Conversely, it seems to me wrong for the purposes of compensatory cover to ignore the physical bond between foetus and mother. Foetus and mother are not the same but neither are they physically free of each other. They are physically connected. The connection ends with birth or by death of one of the two. Both events physically impact upon each. The impact is of more significance than the ‘sprain’ or ‘strain’ given as examples of physical injuries in s 26(1)(b). 
        
       
       
        
        [21] For the purposes of assessing whether there is cover under the 2001 Act, I am not attracted by the stark choice of treating the unborn child either as the same as the mother or as distinct. Where severance of the physical link between mother and unborn child occurs through the death of the child as a result of medical error I consider that physical injury within the meaning of the legislation is suffered by each. That was the view taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in respect of a criminal prosecution of midwives of charges both of negligently causing the death of an unborn child and causing bodily harm to the mother ‘through the death of the foetus which was inside of and connected to her body’ ( 
        R v Sullivan  
        (1991) 63 CCC (3rd) 97). The Supreme Court expressed the opinion that there would be no inconsistency in guilty verdicts on both charges. 
        
       
       
        
        [22] It is not an answer to say that the connection between mother and child would have been severed in any event upon birth. Nor that the complaint made of the appellant is that he did not take steps to induce the child’s birth and achieve earlier severance of the physical connection between the two. Such alternative outcomes, and their undoubted physical impact upon the mother, do not negate the direct physical injury suffered by a mother where her child dies in utero. She suffers a personal injury and such loss within the meaning of the legislation. Her injury is not identical to the injury suffered by the foetus. I am of the view that the  
        Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act  
        provides cover to the mother for loss of an unborn child caused by medical misadventure.” 
        
       
      
    77 Keith J also emphasised the particular context, when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[38] The question has to be answered in terms of the 2001 personal injury compensation legislation. Like the Chief Justice and McGrath J, I find limited assistance, at best, in decisions about criminal liability, guardianship, caesarean sections, and rights in respect of wills and negligence. One limited lesson from those cases is the critical importance of the particular legal, statutory and policy contexts. As the first paragraph of Lord Mustill’s judgment in  
        Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994)  
        … 
          
        makes plain, the law in some of those areas may be afflicted by historical anomalies and may have lost its intellectual foundations.” 
        
       
      
    78 His Honour went on to conclude at [42]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Is it really consistent with the purpose of the personal injury compensation legislation for the mother in that situation not to be able to claim under it? It is true that the baby is not the ‘same as’ the person (but is any part of the human body?) and that it cannot be equated with an organ of the human body (but organs can sometimes be transplanted to another and may be stored for a time outside a human body). On the other hand, at the time of the crash the baby is within the mother. They are physically linked and throughout the pregnancy the baby is sustained by that linkage. Given those facts and the purpose of the legislation, I conclude that the stillbirth is properly to be seen as an injury to the mother.” 
        
       
      
    79 The third majority judgment was delivered by McGrath J. His Honour referred to the line of authority, including Paton, In re F (in utero) and Winnipeg Child & Family Services, to the effect that the foetus had to be born alive in order to acquire civil rights and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[117] … The modern justification for the born alive rule is that legal complexities and difficult moral judgments would arise if the Courts were to alter the common law to treat the foetus as a legal person. … It is important however to bear in mind that the rule according legal rights only at birth is in modern times one founded on convenience. It does not rest on developed medical or moral principle. 
        
       
       
        
        [118] The position at common law, however is not of course decisive or necessarily even indicative of whether the Courts have power to protect a foetus under particular legislation. While the lack of legal personality of a foetus in a statutory context at times may be a significant factor, in the end it is the nature of the rights under the relevant statute that must be ascertained. Thus the differing statutory provisions in different countries at different times have enable Courts to interpret child protection legislation so that it applies to unborn children.” 
        
       
      
    80 His Honour turned to the issue of whether the mother of the child which dies prior to birth is a “person” under New Zealand accident compensation legislation and whether she, therefore, has suffered “personal injury”. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[120] … Here the focus must ultimately be on the meaning of the phrase ‘injury suffered by a person’ and the scope of the concept of a person under the legislation. The High Court judgment, in holding that the foetus was not part of the mother’s person, places great weight on the analysis of the House of Lords in the  
        Attorney- General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994)  
        case. An issue in that case was whether the crimes of murder or manslaughter could be committed where an unlawful injury was deliberately inflicted on a mother and her unborn child, by an accused, the child was subsequently born but later died and the inflicted injuries caused or substantially contributed to the child’s death.” 
        
       
      
    81 His Honour referred to the judgments of Lord Mustill and Lord Hope of Craighead and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “[123] This reasoning for treating the foetus as separate from the mother comes down to the lack of a common genetic identity. That must certainly be accepted as a matter of scientific fact. But it is also a fact that a foetus comprises human tissue which is connected to the mother while it is inside her. The argument based on the biological distinctiveness of the foetus does not of itself address, let alone answer, the alternative argument that because it is connected to human tissue inside her a foetus is part of the mother’s person, albeit, unlike a person’s limb, a biologically distinct part of the mother. The opinions of Lords Mustill and Hope of Craighead in the House of Lords did not discuss the connected tissue argument in any detail although it is implicit from their rejection of the Court of Appeal’s reasoning that they did not favour it. 
        
       
       
        
        [124] The criminal context of the  
        Attorney-General’s Reference 
         case, however, suggests a particular reason for the preference in analysis. Lord Mustill was concerned at the potential operation in the case concerned of the grievous bodily harm rule as part of the crime of murder in English criminal law. If an unborn child were to be viewed as part of the mother’s person, as the Court of Appeal had held, the grievous bodily harm rule would operate and an assault with intention to cause grievous bodily harm to the mother could translate into one with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to the unborn child as part of the mother. If the foetus was born alive after such an assault, but died following birth, that would then allow a charge of murder to be brought. It is plain that Lord Mustill considered the existing law was not based on principles which justified its ‘extension to a case where the defendant acts without an intent to injure either the foetus or her child which it will become’ (p435).” 
        
       
      
    82 His Honour then went on to quote from Lord Mustill, particularly his identification of the foetus as a “unique organism” and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “[126] I certainly accept that reasoning directly from the basis of the ‘born alive rule’ to a conclusion that mother and foetus are a single entity is problematic but that is because, as previously discussed, the rule is based on expediency rather than principle. Problems arising from such direct reasoning are instanced in the discussion of the common law status of the unborn child in ‘Court-Ordered Caesarean Section’ J Manning (1998) 18 NZLUR 546 at pp547-549. Accepting there are such problems however does not preclude the notion of a ‘person’ having a broader meaning, which encompasses the mother and the foetus as a single entity in a particular legislative context. An unborn child can be part of a mother’s ‘person’ in the ordinary meaning of the word. Whether that is so in the interpretation of a particular statute will turn on the context. Parliament may choose to enact legislation on the basis that the person of a pregnant woman includes the human tissue connected to and inside her body. The High Court judgment however gives no consideration to whether that approach is applicable in New Zealand to accident compensation legislation.  
        
       
       
        
        [127] I am reinforced in my view that an unborn child inside the mother is capable of being regarded as part of her as a person by dicta in the majority judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
        R v Sullivan. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    83 His Honour went on to refer and quote from the judgment of Lamer CJC in that case and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “[128] The Supreme Court of Canada was deciding a criminal appeal, albeit one involving less serious criminal charges than the circumstances before the House of Lords in the  
        Attorney-General’s Reference  
        case. The Canadian judgment is nevertheless a helpful instance of a Court expressing the view, when interpreting a criminal code, that bodily harm might be caused to a woman through the death of a foetus she was carrying because it was connected to and inside her.” 
        
       
      
    84 His Honour went on to consider the scope of the word “person” in the New Zealand accident compensation legislation and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[133] The alternative of attributing to ‘person’ a broader meaning which extends to human tissue that is connected to and inside of the body of a woman is one that is open on the ordinary meaning of ‘person’. That is adequately demonstrated by reference to the Canadian Court’s discussion. The fact that the unborn child is not permanently connected to or inside of the mother is a consideration that does not negate the availability of the connected human tissue meaning at the time of the injury to the foetus. This meaning, to my mind, better accords with the policy of legislation intended to compensate for personal injury on a broad basis, whether or not attributable to the fault of another. By holding that in the present statutory context a foetus is part of the person of the mother, so that injury to a foetus is personal injury to that person, I am not of course saying that it is appropriate to view an unborn child as part of the mother in all contexts. In the area of obstetric practice, for example, plainly it is not. The present case is however one which concerns the meaning of accident compensation legislation rather than the requirements of obstetric practice.” 
        
       
       
      The Offence Under s33 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       
      
    85 I have set out above the terms of s33. The words “any person” occurs twice: on the first occasion, referring to the person upon whom grievous bodily harm is actually inflicted and, on the second occasion, referring to the person to whom such harm was intended to be inflicted. The structure of the section, with the use of the words “any person” on each occasion, indicates that this section was intended to encompass the common law doctrine of transferred malice, i.e. that the offence is made out if, while intending to inflict such harm on one particular person, the result of the actions are to in fact inflict such harm on another person. 
     
      
    86 The effect of the born alive rule, which is referred to in a number of the authorities that I have analysed above and which were specifically applied by this Court in R v F, is that the infliction of harm on a foetus will not constitute an offence against the foetus unless that foetus is born alive. Where the intention is to harm the foetus and, in the course of seeking to do such harm to a foetus, grievous bodily harm is in fact inflicted on the mother, the offence is also made out. However, in the present case, the assault on the mother did not inflict grievous bodily harm on her, unless the harm done to the foetus or the placenta is sufficient for that purpose. 
     
      
    87 My review of the authorities indicates that there is no clear rule, applicable in all situations, as to whether the mother and foetus must be considered as one or as separate. The answer will turn on the incidents of the particular legal situation under consideration including, where relevant, the scope, purpose and object of a particular statutory scheme. 
     
      
    88 This proposition is best illustrated by the answers to the two distinct questions in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994). For purposes of the law of homicide, the question posed in those proceedings was as noted above in the negative with respect to murder and in the affirmative with respect to manslaughter.  
     
      
    89 The case which is closest to the present situation is the Canadian authority of R v Sullivan & Lemay where, for purposes of an offence of ‘causing bodily harm’, the Canadian judges unanimously gave the answer that the foetus should be regarded as part of the mother. This authority is not binding on this Court but, in my opinion, the Canadian judges reached the correct conclusion, for reasons which are the subject of more elaborate consideration in a different context by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Harrild.  
     
      
    90 In Attorney-General’s Reference (No 3 of 1994) Lords Mustill and Hope of Craighead emphasised the separate genetic makeup of the foetus. The foetus contains the genes of the father as well as the mother. For that reason, it was not to be regarded as an integral part of the mother. This emphasis on this separate genetic composition may be appropriate when one is considering the identity of a “person” for purposes of the law of homicide. The focus on the foetus as, to use Lord Mustill’s terminology, a “unique organism” is entirely understandable in that context, a context which, Lord Mustill himself emphasised, had its own distinct historical roots. Whether that represents the law with respect to the Australian law of homicide need not be considered in this case. This perspective, however, is not the appropriate one when the law comes to deal with the quite distinctive context of harm to a person, rather than death of a person. 
     
      
    91 In R v Sullivan & Lemay the Canadian judges had no difficulty in asserting, without elaborate reasoning, that for purposes of an offence of causing bodily harm, a child in the birth canal is part of the mother. The basic proposition, however, does not need elaborate reasoning. As Chief Justice Lamer put it at [109], “the foetus … was inside of and connected to her body”. 
     
      
    92 To similar effect are the observations of McLachlin J in Winnipeg Child & Family Services at [27] that: “the foetus is intimately connected with, and cannot be regarded in isolation from, the life of the pregnant woman”. 
     
      
    93 In the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Harrild Chief Justice Elias referred, at [20], to “the physical bond between foetus and mother … neither are … physically free of each other. They are physically connected.”.  
     
      
    94 In that case Keith J stated at [42]: “They are physically linked and throughout the pregnancy the baby is sustained by that linkage”. 
     
      
    95 Furthermore, McGrath J in Harrild, when rejecting the biological distinctiveness of the foetus reasoning of Lord Mustill and Lord Hope of Craighead, identified the alternative approach at [123]: “that because it is connected to human tissue inside her a foetus is part of the mother’s person”. His Honour referred to this as the “connected tissue argument”. The formulation which he found determinative, at [126] and [133], was that the foetus, even if a separate entity for some purposes, was “human tissue connected to and inside” the body of the mother. 
     
      
    96 I find this approach compelling for the law of assault and in particular for the forms of aggravated assault requiring as an element of the offence actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm or wounding. The close physical bond between the mother and the foetus is of such a character that, for purposes of offences such as this, the foetus should be regarded as part of the mother. 
     
      
    97 The aggravated forms of assault reflect the community’s legitimate concern to control violence between persons. The greater the degree of injury, as compared with the result of common assault, the greater the community’s concern. Where such enhanced injury is inflicted on a foetus only, I can see no reason why the aggravated form of offence should depend on whether the foetus is born alive. The purpose of the law is best served by acknowledging that, relevantly, the foetus is part of the mother. 
     
      
    98 Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside the order made by Tupman DCJ. If otherwise entitled, the Respondent should have a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951. 
     
      
    99 Since writing the above, I have seen the judgment of Dunford J in draft. I agree with his Honour’s observations that only in an unusual case under s5F would it be appropriate that a certificate should issue under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951. However, the Crown did not oppose that course being taken in the present case. It also acknowledged the important issue of principle that arose. 
     
      
    100 DUNFORD J: In this matter I have had the opportunity of reading in draft form the judgment of Spigelman CJ. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and with his reasons, and only wish to add something in relation to the grant of the certificate under the Suitor’s Fund Act. 
     
      
    101 Although the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 17 prevents this Court making an order for costs in any appeal, that does not prevent the Court making an order pursuant to s 6(1) Suitor’s Fund Act 1951 granting to an unsuccessful respondent an indemnity certificate under that Act. Such certificate entitles such respondent to recover the costs incurred in the appeal: s 6(2)(b), but there is no provision for the grant of an indemnity certificate to a successful appellant. 
     
      
    102 In relation to appeals under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, this creates an anomalous situation in the sense that whilst an unsuccessful respondent to an appeal under s 5F(2) can obtain a certificate, a successful appellant in an appeal under s 5F(3) cannot, and is left to his or her right to make an application under s 5C, which depends on the discretion of the Director General.  
     
      
    103 It has not in my experience, been the practice of this Court to grant certificates of indemnity in appeals under s 5F and I see no reason why the practice should be varied as a general rule. This case was exceptional in that it raised a question of public importance and involved a consideration of decisions of the highest courts of the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand; and although the Crown Advocate in written submissions submitted that the appropriate remedy for the respondent was an application under s 6C, in oral submissions he conceded that s 6(1) of the Act applied. 
     
      
    104 In these circumstances I have, with some hesitation, come to the conclusion that this is an appropriate case for the grant of an indemnity certificate, but in my opinion the grant of such certificates to unsuccessful respondents in appeals under s 5F should be limited to exceptional cases.  
     
      
    105 ADAMS J: I agree.

      REGINA v. KONSTANTINOS GEORGIOU 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 9 April 2003, following a lengthy trial before me, verdicts of guilty on each count of murder were returned by the jury against each of the offenders, Bruce Malcolm Harrison and Konstantinos Georgiou.  
     
      
    2 Subsequently, I have received lengthy submissions orally and in writing from the Crown and from counsel for the offenders in respect of the appropriate sentences to be imposed. The offences of which the offenders were convicted in each case have been the subject of numerous proceedings in this court and in the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    3 The offenders and in particular Konstantinos Georgiou have been engaged in litigation concerning these offences for a very long period of time now. The short facts of those offences are to be found set out in judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 25 May 1999 in Regina v. Georgiou [1999] NSWCCA 125; in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal following the appeal from the trial before Dowd, J. as to the convictions that occurred on 22 August 1999, that being Regina v. Harrison and Georgiou [2001] NSWCCA 46; the judgment of 21 November 2001 which has been referred to in my interlocutory judgments during this trial; in the judgment of Sperling, J. on a separate trial application; and in the remarks on sentence of Dowd, J. following the convictions to which I have referred. 
     
      
    4 Notwithstanding that those facts have been referred to in those judgments again and again, I will refer to them again here shortly. There is, however, a substantial difference between the legal position and the factual position as it was seen to be following the convictions recorded by Dowd, J. and those which I record in respect of each of the offenders on the verdicts found by the jury in the proceedings before me.  
     
      
    5 Before Dowd, J. at the trial then occurring, the jury found each of the offenders guilty of an additional count to those which were found against them in the proceedings before me, that being one count of attempted murder of Robin David. During the trial before me, I acceded to submissions that there was insufficient evidence in law to warrant that count being left to the jury. I published a short judgment concerning that matter. Essentially, I was of the view that the evidence did not permit me to conclude, as Dowd, J. had concluded, and to which conclusions he referred in his remarks on sentence, that it was open to the jury to conclude that Robin David had gone down into the cellar and had been shot at with intent that he be killed. Consequently, I took the course that I did.  
     
      
    6 Shortly, that leaves against each of the accused verdicts of guilty of the intentional murders of the three victims, Rick De Stoop, Sasha Milenkovic and Michael Kulakowski. These killings occurred in the basement of the Black Market Café in Chippendale. I concluded, although Dowd, J. did not, that all three of those killings were deliberate executions which took place in that cellar when there were present in that cellar the three deceased, the two offenders presently before me and possibly others. There is no doubt that two guns were used in the shooting. There is no doubt that at least two persons participated in the shooting, these being the two offenders whom I must now sentence.  
     
      
    7 There is no doubt that heavy calibre guns were brought to the scene for the purpose, no doubt, of being available to shoot with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm or killing. There is no doubt that whilst the offenders were fleeing from the scene those guns were thrown out or away and there is no doubt that those guns had been supplied to the motor cycle club of which the offenders were members by Mr. Georgiou, some considerable time beforehand. 
     
      
    8 I am unable to say, however, that the deliberate executions to which I have referred occurred as a result of a plan to kill, to which the offenders were party, which had been devised much earlier. I have no doubt that what occurred envisaged that there might be a necessity to use, against the three deceased, the heavy calibre weapons that had been brought to the scene and thus that whatever it was that had given rise to what occurred down in the cellar included in the mind of each of them at least a realisation that a shooting, or shootings and consequent killings may well occur but I am unable to ascertain what it was, whether as Dowd, J. adverted to, some commercial dispute over the door takings at the club, or whether it was some personal dispute over the affections of a young lady who gave evidence in the proceedings, or whether it was some matter of protocol relating to the display of club colours and club presence, or whether it was some disputed matter by either geographical, commercial or prestige territory in the area which caused all this. Whatever, I am left unable to say that what had occurred in the cellar, although highly likely to have been a previously planned execution to which the deceased were lured, was not a killing or killings which arose at the scene as a result of some attempt to reach some agreement, or to discuss some proposition which went awry.  
     
      
    9 There is evidence of the use of another or other firearms in the cellar. I am unable to say how that came about or in what manner or by whom that firearm was used. On that basis I have concluded that I do not disagree with the view of Dowd. J, although he expresses his view as an affirmative finding, that there was not a planned execution, or expresses in the same passage the view that he could not be satisfied that there were deliberate executions, since I understand that finding to mean that his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there had been planned in advance a scheme designed to kill, no matter what might otherwise have occurred, the three deceased in the way in which they were killed. 
     
      
    10 That finding is quite crucial, in my view, to the exercise of the discretion not to impose the life sentence that I reach some such conclusion, as did Dowd, J., by my own independent reasoning as both views and the common conclusion mitigate against the imposition of the life means life penalty.  
     
      
    11 In Dowd, J.’s remarks on sentence he has examined the factual material in great detail. He has had regard also to the subjective circumstances of the offenders. Generally, it is not sought here on behalf of the Crown, or on behalf of either of the offenders that I should differ except in relation to the attempted murder count from his Honour’s views, or that the evidence except in one other respect shows any material alteration in the circumstances. That respect relates to the offender Georgiou.  
     
      
    12 When, following the trial before Dowd. J, that offender subsequently appealed against conviction, the sentence imposed upon him was set aside. He was thereafter sentenced by Judge Shillington in the District Court on eight counts of offences, including supply prohibited drugs, including methylamphetamine and cocaine and the possession of prohibited weapons: a butterfly knife, an electrical discharge device and a nunchaku and lastly possessing a prohibited article, to wit, handcuffs.  
     
      
    13 He had been sentenced for those offences after a jury trial in which he had pleaded not guilty. The proscribed material had been found in premises occupied by him. The trial judge concluded that he had been dealing in drugs on a large scale and that what was found in the premises evidenced that dealing. The things found were plainly the impedimenta of a drug dealer. The dealing had, apparently, occurred in conjunction with other persons. Those persons had been dealt with for other offences in South Australia. The trial judge had regard to those matters and to those sentence imposed in South Australia in order to afford some degree of context to the sentences he imposed. The offender had, as the trial judge referred to, some prior record but of a limited kind and, in particular, in the Children’s Court. His record before me in respect of prior offences includes, of course, this matter before Judge Shillington and those matters. The Crown on that occasion submitted to Judge Shillington that he should commence the sentence he imposed on the date on which the offender was taken into custody for the three murders for which he now must be sentenced. 
     
      
    14 Judge Shillington said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has contended that the sentences imposed on these matters by me should not be backdated. The difficulty which I see in this approach is that if, on his forthcoming trial, he is found not guilty, the prisoner could no longer complain that the backdating should have occur. 
        
       
       
        
        In the event of a conviction after the forthcoming murder trials, the sentencing justice would have available complete flexibility options for sentence. I therefore propose to backdate the sentences to 3 February 1998. 
        
       
       
        
        I take the view that the crime should be regarded globally being activities carried on at the same time and relating to the business in my view of large scale drug dealing.” 
        
       
      
    15 It was in that context that Judge Shillington sentenced the prisoner to a term of eight years imprisonment on three of the charges. Those terms to be served concurrently to date from 3 February 1998. He imposed a non-parole period of six years. He sentenced the prisoner on other counts to concurrent sentences. He found no special circumstances. 
     
      
    16 In this matter, it is accepted that should I impose determinate sentences as Dowd, J. did, I should have regard to the sentences imposed by Judge Shillington which should at least to a substantial extent remain effective That will require substantial accumulation and the application of the principle of totality so that should the sentence I impose be of the order of that which Dowd J imposed, it will still be necessary to ensure that Judge Shillington’s sentence is not deprived of its significance and that it sufficiently marks the criminality of the conduct to which it was referable. That, however, does mean that since I would be imposing a sentence which would be cumulative upon the sentence which Judge Shillington imposed, that same degree of overlap by way of part cumulation and part concurrence should be provided to afford recognition to the total effect of all the sentences the prisoner will have to serve.  
     
      
    17 I am of the view that no lesser period than four years non-parole, even having regard to the totality principle, should be afforded in respect of the sentences imposed by Judge Shillington. That means that I would conclude that the sentence to be passed for this offence should commence on 3 February 2002 in Mr. Georgiou’s case were I to impose the determinate sentences for the murders. 
     
      
    18 The sentence in Mr. Harrison’s case should commence on 9 November 1997. 
     
      
    19 The principal issue with which the sentencing proceedings before me have been concerned is whether bearing in mind that Dowd, J. sentenced the offenders and each of them on the three counts of murder, to which I have referred, to determinate sentences of imprisonment in each case of 33 years with a non-parole period of 28 years to be served concurrently and there was no Crown appeal against such sentences.  
     
      
    20 Yet, the offenders successfully appealed on a legal misdirection to the Court of Criminal Appeal, so that they came back for a new trial.  
     
      
    21 Should I impose sentences more severe than those imposed by Dowd, J? Although there were submissions indicating matters, including the absence of any conviction on the charge of attempted murder of Robin David, on the basis of which it was submitted I should impose lesser sentences, I find nothing in the material which would in any way guide me to consider any lesser sentence should have been imposed or should now be imposed by me. 
     
      
    22 Before dealing with the principal issue, it is now incumbent upon me when sentencing to have regard to the matters set out in s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides for aggravating and mitigating factors that should be considered by the court if known to the court and the objective and subjective factors that might be taken into consideration. The submissions before me on sentencing have all accepted either expressly or implicitly that every one of the aggravating or mitigating factors to which s.21A refers were taken into account by Dowd, J. in his sentencing exercise at the conclusion of the first trial.  
     
      
    23 It is obvious that many of the aggravating factors to which s.21A(2) refers exist in this case, including the use of violence, a weapon, the offence being committed in company, the offence having been committed without regard for public safety, the vulnerability of the victims, the multiple victims and series of criminal acts and that the offence was part of some kind of planned or organised criminal activity, although as to that latter, I reiterate I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the murders themselves were previously planned as opposed to being contemplated. There is little by way of mitigation to which s.21A(3) refers that might be taken in aid of mitigation of penalty in favour of the offenders. 
     
      
    24 In particular, there is no plea of guilty. The only pre-trial disclosure in this case of any substance was when the prisoners, by their own admission before me, revealed they had lied at their previous trial concerning the circumstances in which they then asserted their lack of involvement in the offences. There is no remorse or contrition shown and no possible basis upon which any reparation for the crimes of this magnitude might be made.  
     
      
    25 Those things being said, I accept and I understand all parties accept that except in the respects I have referred to, Dowd, J’s detailed and, indeed, on its face, as I see it, exemplary judgment, records all the matters of relevance to which I have been referred.  
     
      
    26 In the Crown’s detailed written submissions, it was asserted that I should exercise an independent sentencing discretion. So much, of course, I accept. It is for me to exercise the sentencing discretion on the facts and submissions before me and in accordance with principle but in accordance with my own views. However, it is in accordance with principle that I should have regard to two important matters: the first being that as a matter of policy for the better guidance of the exercise of such discretion, a court would have regard to the fact that a prior sentence passed by a Supreme Court judge, after full consideration of all relevant material, would be a matter of considerable importance, to which in the proper exercise of discretion, considerable weight should be given. 
     
      
    27 Further, there is another principle which has been adverted to in a deal of the case law debated before me. Whether it be regarded as a principle or a policy matters not for the purposes of this decision. That is that a party who successfully appeals their conviction should not find that as a consequence of that conviction being overturned on appeal, that they are liable to a more severe sentence than the sentence originally passed unless the circumstances had relevantly or materially changed to their detriment. This is not that case. 
     
      
    28 It is not necessary for me to explore the decisions to which the Crown has taken me as enunciating a proposition of law. It is common ground they do not. These two matters to which I have referred are policy matters which govern the proper exercise of the discretion.  
     
      
    29 The sentencing regime for murder in this State provides that for crimes of great heinousness, a sentence of life imprisonment may be passed. That sentence may only be passed in the event that the crime or crimes accord with the criteria established in s.61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That section provides that the court may only pass a sentence of life means life if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, and community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. When it comes to consider whether those criteria are satisfied, a court must have regard to the prior decisions of the judges of that court sitting in like matters. It is a matter of great importance that having regard to the applicability of the criteria to established facts, that an earlier Judge on the same facts in the same matter has concluded that the criteria are not met.  
     
      
    30 I am not prepared to take the view in this case that they are met. Particularly am I not prepared to determine that the life sentence must be passed in these two cases and on these three charges because the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409 has determined that even if the criteria are met, there remains a discretion to be exercised in accordance with ordinary principles for the court to refrain from the passing of the sentence of life imprisonment. The two principles or policies to which I have referred, I would regard as particularly important when coming to consider that question. That leaves by way of discussion of the matter at a level of principle, as I have presently been undertaking, the question of whether some longer or shorter determinate sentence might be passed other than the sentences imposed by Dowd, J. I have concluded, as I have said, that no shorter sentences could be said to be appropriate on the factual material before me. Having regard to the exercise of my own independent discretion, putting aside Dowd, J.’s views, and taking them into account, I conclude also that no shorter sentence might be imposed.  
     
      
    31 As to any longer sentence, the one matter that might speak in favour of a longer sentence, is that before me each of the offenders went into the witness box, admitted that they had lied at their previous trial, falsely swearing at that trial to facts said to show their innocence of the offence which they before me admitted to be untrue. In the trial before me, they also swore to facts which it might be are closer to the truth bearing in mind, however, their admitted lies and the objective evidence in this case but which were plainly not the full true story. There was very little of what they said which was exculpatory or mitigatory that I would be minded to accept. About all that I am prepared to accept is that they embarked on this exercise of going to the Black Market Café with heavy calibre weapons as part of some exercise involved in the same way with the motor cycle club of which they were members and influenced to some extent by one of the senior members of the club. Although I am not prepared to conclude they were influenced to the extent that they went reluctantly.  
     
      
    32 That said, it seems to me that having regard, particularly to the fact that they have not been convicted of as many offences as they had been before Dowd, J. but, otherwise, that their conduct is very much the same as it was held to be by him and having regard to the fact that it is accepted that although they gave evidence before me that they had previously lied, I should not include in the sentences that I pass upon them any component relevant to their commission of the offence of pervert the course of justice or perjury since I pause to remark that I am informed they have been charged with those offences but not yet dealt with, it does not seem to me that I should pass a sentence having a proper appreciation of the factual material on my own behalf and the benefit of that appreciation of the factual material referred to by Dowd, J., that is any more extensive than the sentences Dowd, J. imposed. 
     
      
    33 These were three appalling crimes. They have left a number of people devastated. They have taken place in circumstances which show that the offenders have committed acts of ruthlessness and callousness which might not have been by them at least by way of prior deliberate planned intent but which in their execution were accompanied by brutal ruthlessness. The sentences involving as they do periods of imprisonment of at least 28 years in respect of each death, are very long sentences. Nonetheless, in my view, for those offences those sentences are well merited.  
     
      
       
      HIS HONOUR: Madam Crown, Mr. Bodor, Mr. Wendler, is there any additional matter whether by any matter of law or any matter upon which you might wish to address that you might wish me to take into account, my having given the reasons that I have so far before I pass sentence in these matters. 
       
       
      I give you that invitation at this point since the sentencing proceedings have been so long interrupted and have extended over such a period? I have exposed in the remarks I have made so far my intent subject to hearing from you any further. 
       
       
      BODOR: Nothing on my part. 
       
       
      WENDLER: No, thank you. 
       
       
      ROBINSON: Hearing my friend Mr. Wendler, I also have nothing. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I note that having made the remarks that I have, the Crown Prosecutor at the conclusion of Mr. Wendler’s concession that he wishes to raise no further matter concerned with his client’s custody and having heard his further concession today that there is nothing further he wishes to say in regard to the matters to which have I referred, has expressed herself as also content. 
       
      
    34 Mr. Harrison and Mr. Georgiou, would you rise please. For each of the offences of murder of which the jury found you guilty and of which I have and do convict you, I sentence each of you to imprisonment for a period of 33 years in each case with a non-parole period of 28 years. Mr Harrison in your case the sentences and the non-parole period are to date from 9 November 1997. Mr. Georgiou, in your case the sentences and the non-parole period are to date from 3 February 2002. Please sit down. 
     
      
    35 I add to what I have said that I am cognisant of the principles referred to in the High Court’s decision in Regina v. Pearce (1998) 156 ALR 684. That decision requires that a judge consider for each individual offence the specific sentence that must be passed for that offence and then give consideration to the cumulation or concurrency of those sentences so as to produce an appropriate totality. Normally, it is not appropriate to simply pass a sentence for all crimes of an identical kind and to order complete concurrence.  
     
      
    36 Dowd, J. took that course. I take that course in this case because this was one continuous and short episode of linked criminality involving three murders committed at the one time by the one group of people, for whatever it was, the one objective and because the total sentence that has been imposed has been imposed to reflect that criminality. 
     
      
       
      Ms. Robinson, unless there is any further matter? 
       
       
      ROBINSON: No your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: The offenders might be removed.

     R v PETER LI 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Dunford J.2 DUNFORD J: This was an appeal by Peter Li against his conviction on three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation contrary to s 61J Crimes Act 1900 following trial by a jury before his Honour Judge Finnane QC in the District Court at Sydney. He also sought leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed on him following such convictions. On 1 December last the Court upheld his appeal, set aside the convictions and ordered a new trial. I now state my reasons for concurring in such order.3 The Crown case was that the complainant had arrived in Australia in October 2000 and become a permanent resident in September 2001. On 17 November 2001 at the invitation of her landlord, Mr Felice, she went with him to dinner at a restaurant in Chinatown in the City where she met the appellant. After dinner, the appellant came and sat next to the complainant and they spent some time talking and dancing together and the complainant discovered that the other people at the table were there for a singles party. The appellant told the complainant he was good with computers, and this interested the complainant because she wanted to study accounting and book-keeping and he said he could help her if she wanted to buy a computer. For this purpose, she gave him her mobile telephone number.4 The following day, the appellant called the complainant and invited her to have lunch and perhaps talk about computers. He picked her up at Ashfield railway station and they went to what turned out to be his house in West Pennant Hills where he told her he needed to get some money and he asked her inside.  
     
      
    5 Once inside he asked her to dance, she said she did not want to dance so he threw her onto the bed and a struggle ensured. He put some clothes in her mouth and said he would kill her if she moved. He then threatened her with a knife and removed her clothes notwithstanding that she told him that she was having her period. Following that, he sexually assaulted her three times including two instances of penile/vaginal intercourse, after which he ejaculated on her stomach. After wiping herself, he allowed her to get up but made her have a shower first using soap and disinfectant.  
     
      
    6 They then dressed and he suggested they should find some place to eat and drink “to celebrate this date”. She said that she was scared and wanted to get out of the house, so she agreed. She started to run, but when she got to the footpath, he grabbed her arm and told her to get into his van. When the van stopped at a red traffic light near Parramatta railway station, she opened the door and tried to jump out, he grabbed her back and put two $50 notes in her bag. She threw the money back at him, got out of the van and ran to the Parramatta station.  
     
      
    7 She then returned home to Croydon Park and complained to her landlord, Mr Felice, who took her to the Ashfield Police Station, and she also left a text message for her boyfriend on his mobile phone which read “I am going to the Police Station. Someone raped me. I need your help”. She went to the Police Station and thence to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where she was seen by Dr Hui to whom she gave a history consistent with her account. An examination was carried out and various swabs were taken. The doctor did not notice any abnormality in the complainant’s physical appearance, and there was no history of any external physical injury. 8 Mr Felice was overseas so his evidence from a previous trial was read, and the reading of his evidence gave rise to the first ground of appeal. In such evidence, he told of taking the complainant to dinner the previous evening and observing the appellant talking with her and he saw them exchanging telephone numbers. The following day he was at his unit when she returned, looking stressed, and complained that that appellant had raped her, threatened her with a knife, and tried to cover her mouth. He accompanied her to the police station but left when her boyfriend arrived. Dr Hui examined the complainant at 12.15am on 19 November 2001. She took a history, performed a medical and personal examination, and took swabs from her abdomen, vulva, low and high vagina. 
     
      
    9 Ms Burger, a forensic biologist examined the swabs and the complainant’s clothing. She detected semen on the high vaginal, low vaginal and vulval smears and also on the wet embilious adominal skin smears. Semen was also detected on the complainant’s underpants and sanitary pad. She also tested the items for DNA and found that the appellant had the same DNA profile as that recovered from the various swabs including high vaginal swab. 
     
      
    10 The complainant’s boyfriend, Mr Feehely, gave evidence of receiving her text message and later attending Ashfield Police Station where he saw the complainant in a distressed state with her hair messed up, her clothes distorted, face marked and one sleeve of her sweater stretched. 
     
      
    11 Constables Smith and Wilson saw the complainant at Ashfield Police Station on 18 November 2001 when she appeared distressed and upset, they also noticed a small cut on her lower lip and Constable Wilson also saw some scratches on her lower right arm. 
     
      
    12 The officer in charge, Detective McCarthy, gave evidence of a search of the appellant’s house pursuant to a warrant on 22 November, when a packet of prescription medicine (Combivir) in the name of Ziaoping Li was located which, from the guidebook included with it, appeared to be for the treatment of HIV. A box of condoms and a number of empty condom packets were also found. Documents were obtained from Concord Hospital (Ex C 27), which indicated that the appellant had attended there and given a history of vaginal/penile intercourse with another women who had told him after they had sex (apparently as a joke) that she had AIDS.13 On 29 November, the appellant attended Eastwood Police Station where he was arrested, warned and then took part in video recorded interview, which was tendered in the Crown case. In that interview, the appellant stated that the complainant’s story was false, that he met her at a singles party, that she was taking the initiative. They danced together, she came with him when he sang karaoke and said she would meet him the following day and go to his house. He said she suggested having sex together.  
     
      
    14 The following day, after she called him on his mobile phone, he picked her up at Ashfield station and took her to his house. When they got there, she asked how much it was worth, they played the piano, danced and kissed. He said she took her clothes off but he was scared to do so because his penis was very small, she laughed at him and they kissed each other’s private parts, it was peaceful, there was no force and no knife. He said “no” to the suggestion that they had sex together, but claimed they just kissed each other. They had a shower, put their clothes on and he suggested they go to a nice restaurant for dinner.  
     
      
    15 In the car, she said that now he was her boyfriend, he could support her for life and give her $200 a week. He got into an argument as to why he should give her money when she was living with another man, but told her that if she lived with him (the appellant), he was prepared to go to the Marriage Registrar the following day, that he was seriously looking for one girl to marry and he was not paying for her. He said she got out of the car at the traffic lights at Parramatta, he gave her $100, but she asked for more, and threw the money on the street.  
     
      
    16 He said that he had back pain, that he was impotent and could not get an erection unless the girl performed oral sex with him, but it still took a long time. He agreed he did ejaculate onto the complainant’s stomach but denied having sexual intercourse with her and denied the use of any force.  
     
      
    17 He denied the complainant’s version when it was put to him and denied other sexual acts; in particular, he denied penetrating her vagina. He said that he had not had sex with anyone in Australia and this was the first time a woman had performed oral sex on him. He later agreed that he had had sex other than with the complainant and had sought medication at Concord Hospital in case he had HIV. He said that the allegations were false and the complainant was after his money. In answer to further questioning, he denied any sexual acts with the complainant apart from kissing her on the vagina and the lips, and in particular, he denied that he had penetrated her vagina. 
     
      
    18 The appellant did not give evidence but two witnesses were called in his case, Robert Yi gave evidence of the interaction of the appellant and complainant at the restaurant the previous evening and Alex Lysenko, a neighbour of the appellant who said that on the day in question, he saw the appellant walking down his driveway with an Asian woman, and they were walking like two lovebirds with their arms around each other. Sometime later, he saw them leaving the premises after kissing each other on the lips.  
     
      
    19 The first Ground of appeal was as follows: 
     
      
       
      “The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of Mr Felice (sic) given at the previous trial”. 
       
      
    20 The appellant was first arraigned on these charges on 10 July 2002 and his trial continued until 18 July 2002 when Defence counsel in that trial withdrew. Fresh Counsel and Solicitor appeared in the matter on Friday 19 July 2002 and on Monday 23 July 2002 the jury in the first trial was discharged.21 Prior to that jury being discharged, the learned trial Judge enquired of the Crown Prosecutor what the situation would be so far as Crown witnesses being available if the jury was discharged and the trial had to start again. The Crown Prosecutor said, “One of the Crown witnesses, Mr Felice, is leaving the country today. He has a one-year open ticket to Italy where his mother is ill, but I understand that there is a chance he could be back after about three months. He is a critical complaint witness, of course…”. His Honour said, “Yes, so you’d be asking for it to go over to enable Mr Felice to be here?” to which the Crown Prosecutor replied “yes”.22 His Honour then indicated that the Crown could rely on his evidence by reading out his evidence in the first trial, but the new Defence Counsel, who had just come into the matter informed Judge that his instructions would require that Mr Felice be further cross-examined, to which the Crown Prosecutor indicated that if the matter was adjourned it would have to be for at least three months (to allow for the anticipated return of Mr Felice). 23 Shortly thereafter, the learned trial Judge asked Defence Counsel, “Why should I be particularly worried about your lack of being able to cross-examine Mr Felice? Why should I take that into account in any way whatever? Why shouldn’t I just order a new trial and start it tomorrow morning or today?…” Defence Counsel’s response was that if the trial was so commenced, the defence objection to the evidence of Mr Felice would be pressed at the appropriate time and the usual rules as to such evidence would apply.24 On 24 July 2002 the second trial commenced and prior to the jury being empanelled, the Judge considered the Crown’s application that the evidence of Mr Felice given in the first trial be read in the second trial.  
     
      
    25 The Crown Prosecutor indicated that she relied on the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 s 65 and the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 s 112 (now s 285) as rendering the transcript of Mr Felice’s evidence in the previous trial admissible, or alternatively she relied on s 116 of the latter Act (now s 289) in relation to the written statement by the witness tendered in the committal proceedings, but she said her application was primarily under s 112. 26 Defence Counsel submitted that the Crown had not established that the witness was “unavailable” for the purposes of s 65 as he had only recently gone overseas and would be returning, so he was not “unavailable” for a particularly long time. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    27 Defence Counsel initially conceded that s 112 would permit the tender of Mr Felice’s evidence in the first trial, but asked that it be excluded on the ground of unfair prejudice. On his instructions there were matters of substance to be put to the witness that had not been put to him in the first trial, viz. an allegation that he was complicit with the complainant in the fabrication of evidence against the appellant. No submission was made that the transcript of the witness’ evidence in the first trial was not a “deposition” within the terms of s 112. 
     
      
       
      
    28 In his judgment, his Honour held that the evidence of the witness, Mr Felice, given in the first trial was admissible in the second trial pursuant to s 112 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and declined to exclude it on the ground of unfair prejudice, holding that the allegation of complicity in the fabrication of false evidence could have been put to the witness in the first trial. No reference was made in the judgment to s 65. 
     
      
       
      
    29 Section 112 (now s 285)) provides that a “deposition” may be admitted as evidence to the prosecution for the trial of the accused person on proof that, inter alia: 
     
      
       
       (1) The deponent is absent from Australia, 
       
      
    (2) The deposition was recorded by or in the presence of the Justice before whom it was taken and in the presence of the accused, or during any period when the accused having been excused under s 41(1 B) of the Justices Act 1902 was absent, and (3) The accused or counsel had full opportunity to cross-examine the witness or, having been excused, was absent when the deposition was taken and was unrepresented. 
     
      
    30 There are other requirements not relevant for present purposes, but the whole context of the section and the other sections in Division 5 of Part 4 of the Act (ss 111 – 116 now ss 284 – 289) make it clear that “deposition” refers to a record of evidence given before justices in committal proceedings or before a coroner, and the word does not include a transcript of evidence given a previous trial. It follows that the evidence in the previous trial was not admissible, except by consent and, although Defence Counsel did not object that such evidence was outside the terms of s 116, he did object to its admission on discretionary grounds on account of his inability to cross-examine the witness.  
     
      
    31 Section 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 so far as material provides as follows: 
     
      
    (1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give about an asserted fact. 
     
      
       
        
         
         … 
         
        
       
      
    (3) The hearsay rule does not apply to a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:  
     
      
       
        
         
         (a) cross examined the person who made the representation about it or  
          
         (b) had a reasonable opportunity to cross examine the person who made the representation about it. 
         
        
       
      
    32 Section 67 requires notice to be given of an intention to adduce such evidence but the court may, on application of a party, allow the evidence to be admitted despite the party’s failure to give notice, subject to such conditions as the Court thinks fit. 
     
      
    33 Clause 4 (1) (e) of Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Act provides that a person is taken not to be available to give evidence if “all reasonable steps have been taken by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or to secure his attendance, but without success”.  
     
      
    34 Mr Felice had been excused on completing his evidence on the first trial on 16 July and was apparently due to leave the country on the day the first jury was discharged (23 July), which was the day before the second trial commenced and the application to tender his earlier evidence was considered (24 July). It is difficult to see what reasonable steps could at the relevant time have been taken to secure his attendance. But in the absence of the required notice having been given under s 67, leave to adduce the evidence was required, and this required consideration of the matters set out in s 192 (2) of the Act: Stanoevski v The Queen [2001] HCA 4, 202 CLR 115. His Honour did not direct his attention to these matters which included:  
     
      
       
        
        (b) The extent to which to allow the evidence would be unfair to a party,  
         
        (c) The importance to the evidence and  
         
        (e) The power of the Court to adjourn the hearing or make another order or give directions in relation to the evidence.  
        
       
      
    35 The evidence was clearly important to the Crown case being primary evidence of prompt complaint on the part of the complainant, but the defence claimed its admission would be unfair in the circumstances, and in any event, the second trial, which at that stage had not started, could have been adjourned for three months, as the Crown requested, or other appropriate period, to enable the witness to return to Australia. Accordingly it is at least difficult to see how the evidence could have been admitted pursuant to s 65.  
     
      
    36 If this were the only successful ground of appeal it may have been necessary to consider whether the appellant was any worse off having the transcript of the witness’ evidence in the first trial admitted rather than his deposition and whether there was really any potentially unfair prejudice to the appellant in admitting the evidence, but in the light of my conclusions in respect of some of the other grounds, I find it unnecessary to consider this aspect any further. 
     
      
    37 Before leaving this ground I should refer to R v Thompson [1982] 1 QB 647, 74 Cr App R 315, referred in Watson, Blackmore and Hosking: Criminal Law (NSW) at para [2.39460] and the earlier decision in R v Hall [1973] 1 QB 496, both decisions of the English Court of Appeal. In those cases it was held that, apart from the relevant legislation, Criminal Justice Act 1925 s 13(3) which was in similar terms to our s 112 and referred to “depositions”, a transcript of evidence given in a previous trial was admissible at common law in a subsequent trial if the witness was too ill to attend the subsequent trial (Thompson) or deceased (Hall); but a different approach appears to have been taken subsequently in the light of more recent legislation: R v Lockley and Corah [1995] 2 Cr App R 554. See Cross on Evidence, Aust ed at para [33795]. In a practical sense there is much to be said for the English approach and the matter might well be considered by the legislature because, in many cases, the evidence in chief and the cross-examination of the witness at the earlier trial, by which time the issues are better defined, may be more relevant than the evidence in chief and cross-examination at committal. However for the reasons given above, I am not satisfied that the transcript of evidence in an earlier trial constitutes a “deposition” within s 112 and consider the English cases should not be followed in this State.  
     
      
    38 Grounds 2 and 3 related to matters arising out of the Crown Prosecutor’s final address and were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 2: The trial miscarried by reason of the failure of the trial judge to direct or warn the jury adequately in relation to a submission made by the prosecutor that the complainant’s “tears in court” were a genuine sign that she did not consent to sexual intercourse 
         
        Ground 3: The trial miscarried by reason of a submission by the prosecutor to the effect that the jury could infer consistency in the complainant’s account to police “because she was not cross-examined about any inconsistency” 
        
       
      
    39 In the course of her address to the jury the prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “At this point in her evidence you may recall that tears started silently falling from Jenny’s eyes in this Court. Now it was not at all theatrical or staged, and please, you are not to reach your verdict based on emotion or purely on sympathy, but you can rationally consider that those tears in this Court as Jenny was asked to recall what happened are a genuine sign that she did not consent to that sexual intercourse”. 
        
       
      
    40 Defence counsel responded to this submission as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “But the fact that she says she was assaulted and did not consent to sexual activity I say is absolute nonsense.  
        And the fact that a person may cry or not cry is of no consequence, in my submission to you” ( 
        my italics). 
        
       
      
    41 It was objected on behalf of the appellant that the Crown’s was an unusual submission and that normally a submission about demeanour should be couched in more general terms, that the prosecutor was asking the jury to reason to guilt for a number of reasons including the fact that the witness cried at the relevant part of her testimony, that the crying was being relied on as “real evidence”, and that a warning should have been given that it may be unreliable under s 165 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    42 I do not agree. Although warnings have been given from time to time about excessive reliance by tribunals of fact on the demeanour of witnesses, the common law has long recognised the relevance of demeanour in the witness box in assessing the credibility of witnesses: Government Insurance Office of NSW v Bailey (1992) 27 NSWLR 304 at 313 C-D. That case concerned observations by the trial judge (in a trial without a jury) of the plaintiff outside the witness box and the necessity for the judge to give notice to the parties of his observations, but as pointed out by Kirby P in the passage indicated, there is no such obligation in respect of observations made of the witness when giving evidence because all parties are necessarily on notice of what they can see for themselves.  
     
      
    43 A party addressing a tribunal of fact on the credibility of a witness is not only entitled to make general submissions in this regard but may descend to particulars. If the witness has fidgeted, displaying obvious discomfort when giving evidence, has laughed, or been slow in giving answers, these matters may be commented on, and I see no reason why crying when giving sensitive evidence may not similarly be relied on. 
     
      
    44 It is of course open to the opponent to suggest that they are not genuine tears, or that the witness is crying because he or she is telling lies and finding it difficult to do so, but I can see no objection to the prosecutor asking the jury to take the crying of the complainant into account when assessing her credibility in saying she had not consented to what occurred. In this case the Defence Counsel in his address responded to the submission in the form I have indicated. I suspect that he did not elaborate for fear that to do so, in the atmosphere of the trial, would only have reminded the jury of her tears and thus aggravated the situation from his client’s point of view.  
     
      
    45 As to ground 3, the actual passage from the Crown Prosecutor’s address was as follows: (T429).  
     
      
       
        
        “Now once again Jenny’s account to the police was taken on the 19 November last year, the day after his happened. You can assume that her account to the police was consistent with the evidence she has given in court because she was not cross-examined about any inconsistency”.  
        
       
      
    46 And later she said:  
     
      
       
        
        “But the law also provides that you can use this consistency, and the immediate reporting of it, when assessing the truth of what happened. That is, what she told Mr Felice, her boyfriend, the police and Dr Hui is evidence that what she said happened, did actually happen. And the law provides that” 
        
       
      
    47 There was evidence in the trial of what the complainant had said to Mr Felice, to her boyfriend and to Dr Hui, but there was no direct evidence of what she had told police as her statement to police had not been tendered, and could not have been unless her evidence was inconsistent with it and the complainant denied such inconsistency (s 106). The evidence of what she told the other persons to whom she made complaint was all consistent with her evidence. 
     
      
    48 In his written submissions, the Crown Prosecutor concedes that the submission ought not to have been made and that the trial judge should have cautioned the jury in drawing such an inference on that basis, because there may have been any number of potential reasons for the absence of cross-examination, including mere oversight by Defence Counsel. However, as he further points out, the submission was otiose since there was a substantial body of evidence before the jury which disclosed that the complainant had made substantially consistent complaints to other witnesses (Mr Felice, her boyfriend and Dr Hui).  
     
      
    49 Of course, Defence Counsel had the opportunity to respond to this submission in his address but, not surprisingly, did not do so, and he made no application to the trial judge for any direction to the jury in relation to the matter. I would not uphold the appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    50 This case can be distinguished in this regard from R v GED [2003] NSWCCA 296 when the complaint concerned what was said by the judge in his summing up where he referred to inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant and a witness on the one hand, and a recorded interview by the accused on the other hand, and where the failure to cross-examine the complainant and the witness on the inconsistencies was used to found an argument to the effect that the accused had lied in his recorded interview on account of a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    51 Grounds 4, 5, 6 related to the directions given by the trial judge in his summing up. Ground 4 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The trial judge failed to direct the jury adequately, and erred in his directions, in relation to lies, having regard in particular to the way in which the prosecutor addressed on the topic in the course of her address to the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The trial judge erred in admitting the record of interview. Alternatively, the trial judge did not adequately direct the jury on how it should use or assess the evidence found in the record of interview. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) The trial judge erred in admitting evidence about AIDS or HIV medicine and notes from Concord Hospital. Alternatively, the trial judge failed to give the jury adequate directions and warnings about this material. 
        
       
      
    52 In her address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the Concord Hospital notes and what she alleged were lies told by the appellant in his recorded interview where he said he was physically incapable of penile intercourse, whereas what he had told the doctors at Concord Hospital indicated otherwise. It was submitted that the submissions put to the jury involved an unmistakable reliance on consciousness of guilt reasoning. I do not see them as carrying such a suggestion and do not believe the jury would have so understood them.  
     
      
    53 In his Written Directions, his Honour referred to “lies” under the heading “Credibility” and there is nothing in those Written Directions suggesting “consciousness of guilt” type reasoning.  
     
      
    54 His Honour’s oral directions on this subject were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, members of the jury, I point out on pages 5 and 6, under the heading “Credibility”, that people have many reasons for telling lies. Sometimes, it has to be said, people will, when confronted with possible criminal charges, tell lies. They try to distance themselves from it. It may be that they are not in fact guilty, and they give a version of events which is very incriminating, and it incriminates them because they are trying to distance themselves from events. It could be panic that causes people to tell lies. There could be other reasons to tell lies. But if a person tells a lie, and you find it to be a lie, that must cause you to consider anxiously any other evidence given by him. And in this case, if he tell lies in his interview, you must give anxious consideration to the question, when he says she consented is that true or is it not? 
        
       
       
        
        Well, if you came to the conclusion he was lying about the fact that he did not ever get his penis in, for example, you might ask the question what does that say about his evidence in this document that she was consenting to whatever occurred; and not only consenting but indeed being the moving party? 
        
       
      
    55 These directions appear to be clearly directed to lies as going to credibility, although the reference to persons “trying to distance themselves from it” is confusing and tends to blur the distinction between lies as evidencing a consciousness of guilt and lies as going to credibility; but his Honour went on to put that remark in the context of a person who is not guilty of an offence incriminating himself by telling lies, and it was apparently intended as a warning to the jury not to infer guilt merely because they were satisfied that the appellant had told lies.  
     
      
    56 The suggestion that if they found that the appellant had told lies, that “must” cause them to consider anxiously any other evidence given by him, and they “must” give anxious consideration to whether it was true or not when he says that the complainant consented is unfortunate and “may” would have been more appropriate in both instances. For a time I was concerned that the use of the word “must” indicated that they were required to reason in a particular way, but on reflection I consider that in the context, his Honour was merely directing them to take such lies as they found into account, but not directing them to reach any particular conclusion in consequence thereof. Otherwise, the direction is unobjectionable as a direction on lies going as to credibility, although it would have been preferable to have warned the jury against employing “consciousness of guilt” reasoning: Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28, 200 CLR 234 at [24]. 
     
      
    57 As to (b), the recorded interview was clearly admissible as part of the investigation, subject to editing of any parts which were irrelevant or unfairly prejudicial to the accused. It contained a number of admissions, including the presence of the complainant with the appellant at his house on the day in question and some sexual activity. It was the appellant’s version of the facts as given to the police and, as the appellant subsequently did not give evidence, it was the only material from him before the jury containing his assertion that the claimant consented to such sexual activity as took place between them and that she was the “moving party”. 
     
      
    58 It also claimed what the Crown asserted were lies e.g. that he was incapable of penile intercourse, but such alleged lies were relied on not as showing a consciousness of guilt (although it would appear they could have been), but as reflecting on his credibility when he asserted that the complainant consented to what occurred. 
     
      
    59 Consistent with what was said in Richardson v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 116 and R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563 the prosecutor’s obligation to put the case fairly would, on its face, require the Crown to tender the recorded interview in its case, unless there were some positive reason for not doing so: R v Soma [2003] HCA 13, 77 ALJR 849 at [31]. Furthermore, the Crown could not anticipate what other matters might be raised in the Defence case (if any) and could not split its case, so had to tender all its relevant and available evidence in its case. 
     
      
    60 The recorded interview was substantially edited and it is now claimed that as edited it was a very unsatisfactory document, but that complaint does not appear to have been made at the trial. However, notwithstanding that the recorded interview was admissible, the Crown in his Written Submissions concedes that the transcript of the recorded interview (Ex C26) is in many respects a confusing document and that the final edited form of the interview which went to the jury may not have fairly conveyed the full import of the appellant’s representations on subjects which the Crown sought to rely on as lies. 
     
      
    61 As to (c), the appellant submitted that evidence relating to the HIV medicine found at his premises and the history he gave the doctor at Concord Hospital was not admissible as such evidence only went to credibility as showing he had lied in his recorded interview; and that it was accordingly inadmissible as s 102 Evidence Act renders inadmissible evidence which relates only to credibility (subject to the specified exceptions). However this evidence was not relevant only to credibility, but was admissible to show that the appellant was capable of doing what the complainant said he had done. This was made clear by his Honour in the last section (pp 8-9) of his written instructions (excluding the last 3 lines) and at T 407 his Honour made it clear that he regarded the evidence as gong not only to credibility, otherwise he would not have admitted it.  
     
      
    62 Accordingly although the direction on lies could have been better expressed and, like the Crown Prosecutor I had some uneasiness concerning the final form of the recorded interview, I was not satisfied that any of the elements of ground 4 were established.  
     
      
       
        
        Ground 5: The trial judge erred in his directions on corroboration and assessment of the complainant’s evidence. 
        
       
      
    63 In his Written Directions, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The complainant’s evidence is the most critical evidence in the trial. However, there is evidence which corroborates her evidence, e.g. the evidence of Dr Hui and Ms Burger that there was semen in her high vagina which could only have got there through penile intercourse and there was DNA evidence showing that the semen found in her vagina has DNA which matches the accused’s DNA in nine respects. Her evidence however is of the utmost importance. If you decided that her evidence was not credible, it is difficult to see how the accused could be convicted of any offence”. 
        
       
      
    64 In his oral directions, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you come to page 7, the credibility of the complainant. The complainant’s evidence is the most critical evidence in the trial. There is evidence which corroborates her evidence. Now, corroborative evidence, members of the jury, is evidence independent of the complainant which tends to connect the accused to a crime and which confirms in some material particular, not only that a crime has been committed, but that the accused committed it. (His Honour then went on to refer to the DNA evidence and the evidence of Dr Hui and Ms Burger). Then clearly there is independent evidence that corroborates the story that there was penile intercourse”. 
        
       
      
    65 There are a number of problems about these directions. Firstly, by the time his Honour came to sum up, the issue in the trial was not whether penile intercourse had taken place, but whether the complainant had consented. On this issue, it was her word against his and it was therefore necessary for the jury to scrutinise her evidence with great care before arriving at a verdict of guilty, and a direction in accordance with that suggested in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 was necessary; see also R v V (1998) 100 A Crim R 488 at 497. His Honour indicated that it was not appropriate to give the direction because the complainant’s evidence was “supported and corroborated” by the forensic evidence that showed penile intercourse had taken place; but as I say, that was no longer the issue, which was whether she had consented; and it was her evidence on this issue that needed to be scrutinised with great care. He did tell them that they had to be satisfied that her evidence was credible but then, instead of warning them that it was the only evidence on the issue of consent and that they therefore needed to scrutinise her evidence with great care, he went on to tell them that her evidence was corroborated because there was other evidence that penile intercourse had taken place. 
     
      
    66 Secondly, there is no longer a requirement to give a direction in such cases that it is dangerous to convict in the absence of corroboration (Evidence Act s 160) and in my view it is undesirable to talk in terms of “corroboration”, but if the judge does introduce the subject in those terms, it is necessary that he or she give proper directions in relation to it: Conway v The Queen [2002] HCA 2, 209 CLR 203 at [62]. This was not done. His Honour should have drawn the jury’s attention to those matters which could amount to corroboration, leaving it for them to decide whether they were satisfied that those matters did in fact corroborate the complainant’s evidence: R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 103.  
     
      
    67 Thirdly, having raised the subject of corroboration, his Honour did not express it in terms of a warning to the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant, but expressed the view, in strong terms, that her evidence (on the issue of penile intercourse) was strongly corroborated in terms which lent support to the Crown case.  
     
      
    68 His Honour’s directions on assessing the credibility of the complainant and on corroboration therefore contained serious omissions and misdirections, and ground 5 was made out. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 6: The trial judge erred in his directions on the burden and standard of proof and in particular in its application to the evidence of Mr Lysenko. 
        
       
      
    69 The trial judge gave appropriate directions on the burden of proof in the Written Directions, and early in his summing up, quite properly said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question in the end is has the Crown proved its case to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt?“ 
        
       
      
    70 However, a short time later, he said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, I’ve said that to you and I will say it again. If there is a  
        doubt in your mind, and it’s a reasonable one,  
        you should give the benefit of it to  
        the accused and you should find him not guilty 
        ” (my italics).  
        
       
      
    71 Such direction is incorrect, inappropriate and should not be given in those terms: Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28 at 32-33 and also R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 at 116-117. His Honour repeated the error at SU 12-13 in the context of lies where he said: 
     
      
       
        
        ”Now, If you have a doubt about which of these cases is correct  
        and 
          
        that’s a doubt based on reason as I have assumed it would be,  
        then you would have to acquit the accused. If you feel that you just cannot be sure whether what the complainant says is true, or what he says is true, then you must acquit him in this particular case”. 
        
       
      
    72 Not only was it there in his last passage a reference to “a doubt based on reason” but in two instances, the judge has proposed to the jury the question which of the two cases is correct, what the complainant says or what the appellant says. This was also a material misdirection. The issue can never be which of the cases is correct or who of the complainant and the accused is telling the truth: Liberato v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 507 at 515. They should have been directed the test was whether taking into account the whole of the evidence, including what had been said by the appellant in his recorded interview, and the witnesses called in his case, they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the complainant’s evidence.  
     
      
    73 The issue was again raised in the context of the evidence of Mr Lysenko when his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “If you accept the neighbour’s evidence, then you would have to have a reasonable doubt about the accused”. 
        
       
      
    74 It was not necessary for there to be an acceptance of the neighbour’s evidence; if his evidence raised a reasonable possibly that what the appellant said on the issue of consent was correct, the appellant was entitled to be acquitted.  
     
      
    75 Other passages were referred in the written submissions relating to what are claimed to be erroneous directions on the onus of proof. It is not necessary to consider them in detail, as the matters I have referred to were each significant and fundamental. 
     
      
    76 Therefore, leaving aside ground 1, I was not persuaded that grounds 2, 3 or 4 (a) or (c) were established although there seemed to be some doubt about the form in which the recorded interview ultimately went to the jury (ground 4 (b)). However, in relation to grounds 5 and 6, I was satisfied that the directions were erroneous and the trial miscarried. No re-directions were sought at the close of the summing up and accordingly Rule 4 applies, but having regard to the fundamental nature of the misdirections, I could not be satisfied that the appellant had a fair trial according to law. In those circumstances it became unnecessary to consider ground 7 (that the trial miscarried by reason of a fact that the manager of the dating agency was not called), and the application for leave to appeal against sentence became irrelevant. 
     
      
    77 HIDDEN J: I agree with Dunford J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Tobias JA: I agree with Shaw J as well as with the additional comments of Howie J. 
     
      
    2 Howie J: I have received the benefit of reading the draft judgment of Shaw J and, substantially for the reasons his Honour gives, I agree with the orders proposed. I would add a few additional comments in amplification of some of the matters to which Shaw J refers in relation to the ground that the verdicts were unreasonable and inconsistent. In the circumstances I do not believe it is necessary once more to set out the facts in any detail. 
     
      
    3 Counsel who appeared at the hearing of the appeal, Mr Bozic QC, conceded that there was no practical difference between the two grounds of appeal originally raised. The argument on behalf of the appellant was that there was no rational basis upon which the jury could come to different verdicts in respect of the counts alleged against him based upon an assessment of the complainant’s reliability. Mr Bozic submitted that a finding that the guilty verdicts were unreasonable would arise from a consideration of what was said to be the unsatisfactory nature of the complainant’s evidence, its defects and inconsistencies and the fact that, by reason of the acquittal of the appellant on some counts, the jury must have looked upon the evidence of the complainant “with disfavour”; see R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [234]. 
     
      
    4 In the written submission on behalf of the appellant the argument relied upon was stated thus: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In essence, the appellant’s submission is that the verdict of not guilty on three charges and the verdict by direction on one, in combination with other factors, so affected the credibility of the complainant that a conviction on the other charges was not open to the jury. 
        
       
      
    5 Mr Bozic, appropriately with respect, acknowledged that this Court is to take into account, in considering the verdicts delivered by the jury, the directions given by the trial judge. In this case, but for the directions set out in the judgment of Shaw J in relation to the fresh ground of appeal, they were exceedingly fair to the appellant. The trial judge told the jury that they had to consider each of the seven counts separately. After warning the jury about the complainant’s evidence in the passage set out in the judgment of Shaw J, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        So what I am saying to you in regard to the complainant's evidence is that you should not find the accused guilty solely on the evidence of the complainant unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is a credible and a reliable witness. Further, if, for example, in the course of your deliberations in looking at each of these offences separately and individually, you feel that the complainant, for example, and I am not saying that you would necessarily find this, but is totally unreliable in regard to two of the offences, just cannot accept that at all, well as a matter of commonsense, you would then have to look at her evidence in respect of the other offences, and treat that with a great deal of caution before you could come to a decision that the accused was guilty of those matters. That again, is a matter that higher courts have considered from time to time and have asked trial judges to direct juries in regard to. 
         
         
        
       
      
    6 A direction to this effect has come to be known as the Markuleski direction in that it was considered in that case. Wood CJ at CL observed (at 257): 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………………….there is merit, as a matter of common sense, in reminding the jury that the existence of a question mark in their minds concerning the credibility, or reliability of the evidence given by a complainant or central witness in relation to one count, may properly be taken into account, in conjunction with all the other circumstances of the case, when they consider the reliability or credibility of the evidence of that complainant or witness in relation to the other counts. 
         
        
       
      In the present case the reference by the trial judge to evidence of “two of the offences” being found to be unreliable, may be explained because of the conjunction between some of the counts in the indictment, for example counts 4 and 5, the incidents at Regatta Park.  
       
      
    7 In light of the fact that the Crown had relied upon other alleged acts of impropriety between the appellant and the complainant as background or contextual evidence, his Honour directed the jury that they had to be satisfied that the “individual cases” had been proved rather than acting on “suspicions, feelings, or belief”. His Honour went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The Crown has alleged specific events have occurred, and you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those specific events have indeed occurred, not some other events. 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour gave the jury an extensive Longman warning during which he said: 
     
      
       
        
        Of course the fact that time goes by, means that evidence is liable to distortion by reason of various factors, including the passage of time, and the likelihood of errors increases of course the longer the delay goes on. But as I have already said to you, in that regard, you have got to take great care when looking at the complainant’s evidence in determining whether you are prepared to accept her evidence beyond reasonable as establishing these charges, not that you are not entitled to accept her evidence, 
         
        
       
      
    9 At the end of his summing up, following a request that he do so, his Honour gave a warning in respect of the complainant’s evidence under s 165 of the Evidence Act as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The second thing is, and you might think I'm going back over old ground, and again, I am giving this direction, but as an indication of any feelings I have in regard the matter, not because I am required to, as a matter of law, because as I said, the only outcome in this trial that I am interested in is seeing that a fair trial is had. That is that the complainant's evidence may be what is called unreliable, and, as such, there is need for caution on your part in determining whether to accept the evidence and the value that you should place on her evidence. 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour then went on to indicate to the jury a number of criticisms made of the complainant’s evidence including the inconsistencies in her evidence about the particular circumstances giving rise to the counts in the indictment. As to that his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        You have heard one reason why the evidence might be considered to be unreliable is the very, having regard to the very nature of how a number of these events have been changed in particular from time to time, from the time she made a statement to the time she gave evidence in one trial, the time she is giving evidence now. That is not saying that the complainant is being dishonest, but the question is, is her evidence reliable or is it unreliable, and the warning I give you is that because of all those things, it is evidence that you would have to treat with a great deal of caution before you could come to a conclusion of beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has commented these offences. 
         
        
       
      Putting to one side the criticism made of that paragraph in the fresh ground of appeal, it reminded the jury of the need for caution by reason of apparent inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence. 
       
      
    11 In the course of his sentencing remarks the trial judge said the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……….. The victim made three statements to the police, two in August 1999 and one in April 2000. She also gave evidence at three trials. The delay in the police investigation was caused by apparently back of staff in the area at the time. Given the age of the victim at the time, namely 10 years of age, the number of times she was spoken to and a number of times she gave evidence, discrepancies in her accounts appear which were well detailed to the jury by [the appellant's] counsel [ ]. 
         
         
        Despite all this though the victim was a most impressive young woman now aged 14 who she says is now trying to put all this behind her. She readily admitted the discrepancies and memory problems that she had and the Jury were no doubt impressed at her honesty in that regard. Apart from the issue of complaint, the victim's evidence was uncorroborated. 
         
         
        Clearly the Jury felt that the complainant's reliability as opposed to her honesty on some counts was not sufficient to establish the charges beyond reasonable doubt. There was also be directed verdict as to counts six about which the Jury had already detected from their questions to me that there had been a difficulty with the evidence in regard to that particular matter. Whether I agree with it or not, I can understand the rationale behind the Jury verdicts which at first blush may appear to be somewhat inconsistent. 
        
       
      
    12 This Court must make its own independent assessment of whether the jury should have had a reasonable doubt about both the complainant’s credibility and reliability from the evidence as can be gleaned from the transcript. It cannot allow the view of the trial judge to unduly influence that assessment. But this passage from the remarks on sentence reminds this Court of the need to bear in mind the advantageous position of the jury who have seen the complainant give evidence and be cross-examined over a considerable period of time. Although in recent times it appears that, at least in civil proceedings, there is a degree of scepticism about the ability of one person to determine whether another person is telling the truth from seeing the witness give evidence, the Court has to recognise and pay due regard to the fact that the verdicts of the jury may be appropriately and justifiably influenced by the demeanour of the witness. 
     
      
    13 It was observed by Wood CJ at CL in Markuleski that concern arising from, what could appear to be, inconsistent verdicts, might be alleviated by having regard to the directions and warnings given to the jury as to how they were to approach their task in assessing the evidence of the complainant, especially between different counts. In the present case the jury were repeatedly reminded of the importance of considering the reliability of the complainant in respect of each of the incidents giving rise to a charge in the indictment. It is unfortunate that his Honour went so far as to emphasise reliability at the expense of credibility. But provided that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was honest, then the directions given emphasised appropriately the importance of the jury considering the reliability of the complainant as a separate and distinct issue from her honesty both generally and in respect of the various counts on the indictment. 
     
      
    14 There were clearly grounds upon which the jury might have doubts about the reliability of the complainant both generally and in respect of particular counts even though they accepted beyond reasonable doubt that she was honest about her allegations generally. There was nothing in the present case that indicated that the complainant could not have been telling the truth generally about her allegations other than her lack of reliability in respect to specific incidents. The jury were entitled to find that this unreliability was due to the length of time that had transpired between the incidents and the giving of evidence and the young age of the complainant at the time of the alleged offences. Although there was evidence that indicated that she was unreliable, especially in relation to the Regatta Park allegations, it did not follow that the jury should have disbelieved her general allegation of sexual abuse by the appellant or should not have discriminated between her evidence on one or more counts and her evidence on other counts. 
     
      
    15 There was evidence of complaint. True it is that such evidence does not amount to independent corroboration or support for the evidence of the complainant and, in this particular case, the trial judge told the jury it was not evidence of the truth of the allegation made in the complaint. But it was capable of supporting the complainant’s credit generally in relation to her allegations of sexual abuse by the appellant and it is a matter to which this Court should have regard in the same way that the jury were invited to consider it. Although the complainant admitted that what she said to her mother about the specific allegations was not true, it was still evidence capable of supporting her general credit in respect of the alleged sexual relationship. 
     
      
    16 Although there was no evidence which otherwise supported the truthfulness of the complainant’s accounts there was nothing which indicated that she should not be perceived as an honest witness trying her best to recall events occurring four years earlier as part of a course of conduct when she was aged 10 years. The jury were made aware of the dangers of acting on that evidence by appropriate warnings and directions, but there was no reason why they should not have done so where they were satisfied that the complainant was reliable in her account. 
     
      
    17 The different verdicts can be explained by the jury’s failure to be satisfied of the reliability of the account relating to a particular count in the indictment to the necessary degree in light of the inconsistencies arising in her different accounts of the incident. But there was no reason why that dissatisfaction should have been felt throughout the whole of her evidence. In my view the different verdicts were not unexpected and were understandable. I am not persuaded that any of the conditions referred to by Wood CJ at CL in Markuleski at [234] existed to give rise to the possibility that a jury properly instructed must have looked with “real disfavour” on the credibility of the complainant. In particular, contrary to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, I do not believe that the accounts given by the complainant were inherently improbable such that the jury should have rejected them. 
     
      
    18 The verdicts of guilty were, however, rendered unsafe by his Honour’s directions as to how the jury might approach their assessment of the complainant’s evidence in the passages set out in the judgment of Shaw J. Although the jury were entitled to come to the view that the complainant was honest and reliable beyond reasonable doubt in the allegations supporting the counts upon which the appellant was convicted, the Court cannot be confident that they did so. The convictions must be quashed. But the evidence was not such that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt had they been appropriately directed and, therefore, the Court should order a new trial. It is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether the appellant should be required to stand trial on a fourth occasion. 
     
      
    19 Shaw J: The appellant appeals against a conviction for four charges entered at the District Court 17 December 2002 by Judge Williams after a trial lasting approximately two weeks.  
     
      
    20 The appellant was charged with 4 counts of aggravated indecent assault and 4 counts of sexual intercourse with a person over 10 years but below 16 years of age. In relation to each count the complainant, CH, was the same: the niece of the appellant. The circumstance of aggravation for each count alleging indecent assault was that the complainant was a person under the age of 16 years, being 10 years old at the material times. The following chart explains the charges and the result: 
     
      
    Charge Date Location Plea VerdictIA 1/08/98 - 12/01/99 Emu Plains (Family home) NG NGIA 1/08/98 – 12/01/99 Emu Plains (Walkway) NG GSI 1/08/98 – 12/01/99 Emu Plains (River) NG G IA 1/08/98 – 12/01/99 Emu Plains (Regatta Park) NG NGSI 1/08/98 – 12/01/99 Emu Plains (Regatta Park) NG NGSI 1/08/98 – 12/01/99 Emu Plains (Bedroom) NG NG*IA 12/01/99 Emu Plains (Bedroom) NG GSI 12/01/99 Emu Plains (Bedroom) NG G* By direction 
     
      
    21 The appellant had pleaded not guilty to each charge and stood his trial before Judge Williams and a jury on 9 December 2002. This was the third trial for the appellant. The first trial was aborted after the jury had retired when one juror realised that he or she knew one of the witnesses. The second trial resulted in convictions on each count that were subsequently overturned by this Court: see R v N [2002] NSWCCA 281. 
     
      
    22 The grounds for appeal allege that the verdicts of guilty on counts 2, 3, 7 and 8 are inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on counts 1, 4, 5 and the direction in relation to count 6. It is also alleged that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the whole of the evidence. There was a further ground of appeal raised after the hearing of the appeal. I will address the circumstances and outcome of that ground later in these reasons. 
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    23 The appellant resided at the home of his sister and her family, including the complainant, during the period of time mentioned in the indictment, that is, between 1 August 1998 and 12 January 1999.  
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    24 The complainant was the primary witness for the Crown. She was fourteen at the time of the trial. She testified that, at the material times, there were six people residing at the family home in Emu Plains. They were: herself; her mother, Zsuzsa; her two brothers, Andrew and Matthew; her uncle, the appellant; a friend of her brother, Jericho; and a family friend named George Christou. She said that she slept with her mother in her mother’s bedroom. Her uncle also slept in that room on a separate bed.  
     
      
    25 Approximately three to four weeks after her uncle came to live in the family home he started to do ‘sexual things’. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        The first time it happened it was in my mum’s bedroom…I was lying in bed around midnight, I think I’m not quite sure, and [J] was very drunk and my mum had a few to drink as well, and I was just lying down trying to get [to] sleep. It was pitch black and I felt a hand rubbing up my leg. I’m like, “what’s that” and my mum - …I tried to wake my mum up and I said to mum – because I saw [J] kneeling next to the – just in front of the bedside table, and I said mum, “Can you please take [J] to bed. He is awake. Can you please put him to bed”. I didn’t tell my mum exactly what he was doing and then after that, he just kept doing it, and all she said was, “[J], can you just go to bed”. Whenever my mum spoke, he moved his hand and he, you know, took it out from under the blankets. And when she was quiet, he started putting his hand up my leg again, and I’m like, “Mum please, can you put him to bed”. And then mum got up – I’m pretty sure she got up and she took him to bed. (T23-24)  
        
       
      
    26 The complainant said that this touching was ‘inside the thigh’ and ‘just below [her] vagina’. It took approximately 20 minutes and then the complainant fell asleep. This event was not the subject of any count on the indictment.  
     
      
    27 She said that this touching would occur often after that night, including: 
     
      
       
        
        …in my mum’s bedroom, …down the river, happened in the playground at Regatta Park, at the park down at Lennox, or Duke Oval where the cricket fielders are. (T25) 
        
       
      
    28 After the first incident that occurred in her mother’s bedroom on the subsequent night, or the one following that night, the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        …he was masturbating me, he made me masturbate him. (T26) 
        
       
      
    29 The complainant indicated that this meant him touching her vagina, or her touching his penis. This occurred in the appellant’s bed in her mother’s bedroom. The appellant invited the complainant to sit on his bed. She was wearing boxer shorts and a t-shirt if it was at night, or pants or shorts if it was during the day. The appellant was wearing underpants and a t-shirt. She could not recall if it was day or night. She said that the appellant touched her vagina and her clitoris. This event was the first count on the indictment for which the appellant was found not guilty.  
     
      
    30 The complainant said that she did not report the incident because: 
     
      
       
        
        I thought, I didn’t, I didn’t think, I thought it was one time, I didn’t think it would go on. (T28) 
        
       
      
    31 The next incident the plaintiff could remember was at the Regatta Park, near her home. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        He asked if, in the plastic bubble at the playground, he asked if he could do 69 with me I did not know what that was at the time. And also he tried to sexually penetrate me and, you know, he put his fingers inside my and all that. (T29) 
        
       
      
    32 She said that ‘I masturbated him and he masturbated me’ (T37). The appellant put his hands down the complainant’s pants ‘and he put his fingers in me now and again’ (T37). She said that she ‘did it to him first’ (T38). He undid the zipper of his jeans to expose the penis and she masturbated him until he ejaculated. These incidents were the subject of the fourth and fifth counts on the indictment for which the appellant was found not guilty. 
     
      
    33 The complainant said that after the first few incidents, the appellant said to her that: 
     
      
       
        
        If I tell anybody he’d kill me and the people that you love and all that. (T40) 
        
       
      
    34 The complainant said that a further incident occurred whilst she and the appellant were sitting on a park bench near the ‘Freeway Bridge’ near her home. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        When we were sitting on the park bench, because it was like a public walkway or where you walk your dogs or something, a lot of people walk past and John got me to masturbate him…He got his penis out and he grabbed my hand and pulled me closer, so that if anybody comes, I’m close to him, so they can’t see as I was masturbating him. Whenever somebody would come, I would strop so it didn’t look obvious and then heaps of people came so he goes, “There’s too many people coming, so let’s move down to the bush”. So as we went down there. I was masturbating him and then he ejaculated and then he grabbed my hands and he tried to – sexually penetrated me. (T43) 
        
       
      
    35 The ‘bush’ was scrub near the banks of the River. At that location, the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        …he grabbed my hands and he put them on my head and held my hands together in a cross shape and with one hand and then pulled my pants down to the ground and – well, not to the ground, pulled them down to my ankles, and we were lying down. Then he tried to – sexually penetrated me…he grabbed his penis and he put it inside me…in my vagina. (T44-45) 
        
       
      
    36 She said that she knew he had done this because it hurt. She told him to stop and he said, ‘No, just one minute’. The complainant said this took about 5 – 10 minutes. The events on the park bench and the river bank were the subject of counts two and three respectively. 
     
      
    37 The appellant and complainant then went to the Lennox Shopping Centre, and then, Dukes Oval, across the road from the shopping centre. They sat down on a bench that was ‘very open’ which meant that ‘[f]rom every angle someone could see you’. The complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        I just sat down next to him and he grabbed my hand and then I just started masturbating him and then we got on our bikes and then went home. (T47) 
        
       
      
    38 On another day, again under the Freeway Bridge, the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        It’s like a little fishing spot where people go fishing and we went down there and he masturbated me. He put his fingers or finger inside me, I’m not quite sure. And I masturbated him. (T47) 
        
       
      
    39 These two events were not the subject of any count on the indictment. 
     
      
    40 The complainant was then asked about the ‘very last occasion’. The complainant was lying on the appellant’s bed wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Her mother was not present. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        There were people on the property but not exactly in the house. (T49) 
        
       
      
    41 The complainant said that the appellant put his fingers inside her vagina, rubbing her clitoris. The appellant was wearing underwear and an ‘Ice Cold Bitters’ T-shirt. During the incident, the complainant said, Mr Christou came into the room. The appellant put on shorts and went with the complainant downstairs until Mr Christou left, and then they both returned to the bedroom. Mr Christou appears to have returned to the bedroom and the complainant then left to be with her mother. These events were the subject of the seventh and eighth count on the indictment. 
     
      
    42 At some point later, the complainant told her mother about the events involving her uncle. The complainant and her mother then saw police and the complainant was investigated by a doctor at the Westmead Children’s Hospital. Those medical examinations did not reveal any internal physical trauma to the complainant’s vagina.  
     
      
    43 The complainant said that soon after she told her mother, the appellant rang her from hospital and asked her if she had ‘told anyone’ and she told the appellant ‘no’. The complainant’s mother took her to see her uncle in the hospital. He asked the complainant if she had ‘told people’ and she repeated that she had not.  
     
      
    44 In cross examination, the complainant agreed that she had thought the events that had occurred, did so after February, but on later conversation with her mother, assumed that it was more likely to be after August. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. You see, it was your memory, wasn’t it, that all these things happened to you after your birthday [in February], is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It was my memory but I can’t remember the date. (T78) 
        
       
      
    45 However, in her first statement to the police, the complainant had indicated that the assaults began after February. The complainant indicated that she did not have a good memory of these incidents because she had ‘gotten on with [her] life’. She remembered only a ‘few things’ about these incidents.  
     
      
    46 In relation to the incident at the bench near the river, the complainant repeated that the appellant made her masturbate him. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        He grabbed my hand and he pulled his penis out of his pants, put his T-shirt over it so to anybody walking past they couldn’t see it, and then did the movement with his hand at the same time as with mine. (T87) 
        
       
      
    47 She said that he only pulled his T-shirt over her hand when people walked past and that he would let go of her hand and she would pull away from him. In cross examination she said that the appellant did not ejaculate at the bench near the river. They then moved ‘metres’ towards the riverbank. She then masturbated the appellant and he ejaculated. He then wiped the complainant’s hand and himself with the complainant’s T-shirt. Minutes later, the appellant held down the complainant’s hands and attempted to penetrate her with his penis. He did this for approximately five minutes.  
     
      
    48 The complainant was asked whether she had mentioned Dukes Park in her statements to the police made in August 1999. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Are you telling the jury now that you have a memory of having put in one of those two statements….Duke Park? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I don’t have a memory, but something happened there, so it had to be in one of the statements. (T97) 
        
       
      
    49 The complainant later conceded that she had not mentioned Dukes Park in her first statements to the police. When asked about her memory of Dukes Park, the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        I remember bits of it…I remember us sitting at the park bench. I remembered what happened down the river…(T115) 
        
       
      
    50 The complainant also recalled that Duke Oval could also be known as Lennox Park or the ‘Cricket field’. 
     
      
    51 Similarly, with regards to the incident in the plastic bubbles at the Regatta Park, the complainant agreed that she had not mentioned the bubbles in her first statements to the police made in August 1999: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. And yet you didn’t say anything about those that plastic bubble at all in either on the 9th August or 10th august 1999 did you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I didn’t say plastic bubbles, I said Regatta Park. (T106) 
        
       
      
    52 The complainant later conceded that she had no real memory of that day but she could remember what had occurred in the bubbles. In her first statement to the police the complainant had said that she and the appellant had been sitting on the ground and that he had tried to penetrate her. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. That’s the area of your second statement where you refer to Regatta Park, right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say nothing about plastic bubbles, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q, You say that in fact you were sitting on the ground and that you were pushed to the ground, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you say that in fact your uncle put his penis between your legs, isn’t that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You haven’t told the jury that today have you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Because I didn’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You haven’t told the jury anything about his penis going between your legs at Regatta Park, have you today? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I didn’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As far as Regatta Park is concerned, you don’t really have any memory of that incident at all today do you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I remember when he asked me in the bubbles…I remember when he asked me in the bubbles about wanting to do a sixty-niner. (T113) 
        
       
      
    53 In his closing address to the jury, counsel for the appellant at trial put to the jury that the complainant’s version of the Regatta Park incident was inconsistent with what was said to police in her first statements. He also noted that police had taken two different sets of photographs of Regatta Park, the first on 24 September 1999 and the second on 20 March 2001. Only the second photos related to the plastic bubbles. He put it to the jury that the second photos were required because the complainant had told police that Dukes Oval was the ‘only park’. 
     
      
    54 The complainant said that she could only remember going to Regatta Park the one time with the appellant. She could not remember him trying to penetrate her with his penis on that day. The complainant could remember that the appellant had wiped himself on her T-shirt during the Dukes Park incident, but could not remember what occurred in the Regatta Park.  
     
      
    55 In re-examination the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Was there any reason for not saying to the police officer “In the yellow bubble” or rather “Regatta Park”? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Because I used to call it Regatta Park. If you take the dog for a walk you don’t say “To the yellow bubble”, I say “I am going to take them to Regatta Park”. (T154) 
        
       
      
    56 The complainant agreed that she had not mentioned the first incident in her mother’s bed in either statement. It was also put to her that she had not mentioned that incident at either trial. The complainant could not remember ‘anything’ she said at the first trial of the appellant. It was put to her that there were some discrepancies in her account of that first incident in her mother’s bedroom between the first trial (in which she said that the appellant invited her to his bed) and the relevant trial (in which she stated that he appeared next to her while she was in her mother’s bed).  
     
      
    57 There was no evidence given in relation to count six, which was the basis for the trial judge to direct the jury to enter a verdict of acquittal on that count. 
     
      
       
      Summary 
       
      
    58 The appellant’s grounds of appeal are interrelated. The inconsistency asserted is that the verdicts of acquittal cannot be reconciled with the verdicts of guilty. That would be an appropriate finding provided that the ground of ‘unreasonableness’ is made out with respect to the counts on which the appellant was convicted. That is, it would then be established that the verdicts of conviction are inconsistent with the verdicts of acquittal because a jury must have disbelieved or had doubts about the reliability of the recollection of the complainant and should not have convicted the appellant on any count. 
     
      
    59 The complainant’s evidence was clear regarding some matters though it was, at other times, more uncertain and vague. That is, this was not a case in which the complainant’s recollection and reliability was completely shaken. She was clear about certain incidents though unclear on others.  
     
      
    60 M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and MFA v The Queen (2003) 77 ALJR 139 provide authority for the proposition that a court of criminal appeal must overturn a conviction if the court has a view of the evidence that means that a jury should not have convicted an appellant. The majority in M said (at 494): 
     
      
       
        
        In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. 
        
       
      
    61 There was a clear difficulty in the recollection of the complainant regarding the incident that occurred in her mother’s bed (otherwise described as the ‘first incident’). Aspects of that event were detailed in her evidence at trial that had never arisen in either of the two previous trials or in her statements to police.  
     
      
    62 There was, however, a clear recollection of what occurred at Dukes Park even though the appellant asserts that aspects of this incident were not mentioned in her statements to police. Counsel for the appellant at trial put to the jury two issues regarding this incident: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the mention of the incident starting on the bench at the oval, and the later incident of the appellant wiping himself on her T-shirt, had not been mentioned to police in the complainant’s statements;  
        
       
       
        
        and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the ‘ 
        biological impossibility 
        ’ of a man post-ejaculation attempting penile penetration of a young girl. 
        
       
      
    63 The second submission was repeated in this Court. It was submitted that this would have been ‘improbable’. The difficulty with this submission is that a jury of twelve people, properly directed by a trial judge, found it proved beyond reasonable doubt. Though the appellant asserts that it is unlikely that a person would sexually assault a young girl in an open park with people in the vicinity, again, a jury found this proved beyond reasonable doubt. Some weight must be given to that finding. In MFA v The Queen (2002) 193 ALR 184, Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said (at [34]): 
     
      
       
        
        The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that the complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility.  
        
       
      
    64 The jury were warned that they should look at the evidence of the complainant with some care before they relied upon her evidence to convict. The issues raised in this appeal as demonstrating the ‘unreasonableness’ of the jury convicting the appellant were put to the jury as reasons not to convict the appellant on the word of the complainant. Nevertheless, the jury did convict the appellant on the Dukes Oval counts, and the incidents in the mother’s bedroom on 12 January 1999. The complainant’s version of events of that ‘last time’ (that is, the incidents involving the appearance of Mr Christou in the mother’s bedroom during the assault) was also mostly consistent throughout the three trials.  
     
      
    65 Counsel for the appellant conceded before this Court that the complainant’s evidence was ‘stronger’ in relation to these counts and the Dukes Oval counts than those in which the appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
    66 However, it is troubling that while the complainant seemed to have a clear recollection of something occurring in the plastic bubbles at Regatta Park, the jury returned verdicts of not guilty to those counts (i.e. counts four and five).  
     
      
    67 This could indicate two things. Either the jury disbelieved the complainant, or had doubts about her reliability as a witness, or else the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s account of the incident at Regatta Park was correct, given the inconsistencies between what was said to the police, what was said in the first trial and what the complainant testified as having occurred in the relevant trial.  
     
      
    68 In M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494 Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, and Toohey JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.  
        
       
      
    69 Despite the acquittal of the accused on some counts on the indictment, I am not satisfied that a reasonable jury should not have convicted the appellant on counts 2, 3, 7 and 8. I am satisfied that it was reasonably open to the jury to convict the appellant on those counts.  
     
      
    70 However, after the Court reserved judgment in this appeal, the Court notified the parties that it wished to have submissions upon two passages in the summing up concerned with the manner in which the jury should approach the evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
    71 After giving directions generally on the manner in which the jury were to consider the evidence of witnesses and the fact that the appellant did not give evidence in the trial, his Honour turned to consider the evidence of the complainant and said (my underlining):  
     
      
       
        
         
        In this case, a significant part of the evidence as to the actual offences themselves rests on the evidence of the complainant [ ]. The offences are denied by [the appellant]. You should therefore look at the evidence of the complainant with great care before coming to the conclusion as to what in fact occurred based on the evidence alone. This is a direction of law that I am required to give in cases like this, and is not an indication of any expression of how I see the evidence in any way whatsoever. I am required to give this direction of law. I am not expressing any opinion one way or the other on the evidence. But the complainant's reliability and credibility are matters for you, the jury to decide, looking at the whole circumstances of the case.  
        Quite often in situations like this, it is not so much a question of whether someone is being truthful or honest, but more importantly, are they reliable as witnesses. Can we completely trust everything that they say as being correct, as a matter of fact, because I must say that generally speaking, it is very hard to determine whether someone is actually telling lies, and most people who come to court, or a large majority of people come to court to give evidence as witnesses are not lying. But whether they are reliable, whether they are credible, is another question 
        . 
         
         
        It is a matter of commonsense, if one person gives a version of events that is denied by another, you, as the jury must be most careful, when examining that evidence, before being able to say that you are satisfied that what is alleged as a matter of fact by the witness, [the complainant], is in fact what happened. You have heard arguments addressed to you by [defence counsel] as to why you should not come to that conclusion. I will come to some of those in a moment. 
        
       
      
    72 At the end of the summing up and notwithstanding that his Honour had given a very full Longman warning, both parties asked his Honour to give a warning under s 165 about the age of the complainant at the time of the alleged offences. His Honour complied with the request and gave the jury a lengthy caution as to the possibility that the complainant’s evidence might be unreliable by reason of her age at the time of the allegations, 10 years, and the delay between the alleged events giving rise to the charges and the giving of her evidence before the jury. During the course of this warning his Honour said (my underlining):  
     
      
       
        
         
        You have heard one reason why the evidence might be considered to be unreliable is the very, having regard to the very nature of how a number of these events have been changed in particular from time to time, from the time she made a statement to the time she gave evidence in one trial, the time she is giving evidence now. 
         That is not saying that the complainant is being dishonest, but the question is, is her evidence reliable or is it unreliable, 
         and the warning I give you is that because of all those things, it is evidence that you would have to treat with a great deal of caution before you could come to a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has committed these offences. 
         
        
       
      This was the last thing said by the trial judge to the jury before they retired to consider their verdicts. 
       
      
    73 After attention was drawn to these passages, the parties filed further written submissions. The appellant sought leave to add a further Ground of Appeal contending that his Honour erred in directing the jury that they had to be satisfied as to the reliability of the complainant rather than her truthfulness. The Crown submitted that leave should be refused, as there was no error in the passages quoted above. 
     
      
    74 It is clear that the principal issue before the jury was the credibility of the complainant. It could hardly have been otherwise. It was not the appellant’s case that the complainant was truthful as to her allegations of sexual abuse by him upon her, but was simply mistaken as to her account of the particular incidents that gave rise to the charges before the court. Although the appellant did not give evidence, he had participated in an interview with investigating police during which he had denied any sexual contact with the complainant. Although the Crown has submitted that there was no ‘full-blooded attack’ on the complainant’s credibility during the trial, there is no doubt that defence counsel was asserting that she was untruthful and using issues such as the inconsistency in her accounts and her unreliability generally as indicators that she was telling lies when making her allegations against the appellant. 
     
      
    75 The Crown has submitted that the jury would have been aware from the summing up as a whole that there were two issues before them: (i) was the complainant honest? (ii) if so, was she reliable? It was further submitted that this was the correct approach and the one that the jury should be assumed to have taken. 
     
      
    76 It is clear from those parts of the summing up where the trial judge gave what might be seen as formal directions about the onus and standard of proof, that the jury would have understood that, before they could have convicted the appellant of any offence, they had to be satisfied of both the honesty and accuracy of the complainant. But the vice in what his Honour said to the jury, in the first passage quoted above, was that they might have taken him to be indicating that the real issue for them to determine was the complainant’s particular reliability in relation to the incidents giving rise to the charges rather than her general honesty in respect of her allegations of sexual abuse against the appellant. 
     
      
    77 There were three reasons given by his Honour in that passage to explain why the jury should concentrate on the reliability of the complainant rather than her honesty. These reasons did not relate to the particular complainant or her evidence but were in general terms. But that generality did not diminish what importance the jury might have given to his Honour’s comments on the approach they should take to an assessment of the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    78 The first reason given was that ‘in situations like this it is not so much a question of whether someone is being truthful or honest, but more importantly, are they reliable as witnesses’. In the context of giving a Murray warning, the situation to which his Honour was referring was that the evidence in the Crown case rested to a significant part on the evidence of a complainant. But the fundamental issue in such a situation is whether the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was truthful and accurate in her account of the appellant’s sexual relationship with her. If the jury were not so satisfied, that is if they had a doubt about her honesty in that regard, the question of her reliability about particular incidents did not arise. In any event, unreliability can reach such a point that it might raise a doubt about the honesty of the witness. Whether the complainant was being honest was very much a question in this case and the trial judge should have said nothing that would suggest otherwise. The point to be brought home to the jury was that a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was truthful and accurate was not itself sufficient to prove each of the charges unless they were also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was reliable in respect of all or any of them. 
     
      
    79 The next reason given by his Honour for the jury concentrating on reliability rather than truthfulness was that, generally speaking, ‘it is very hard to determine whether someone is actually telling lies’. The jury might have taken this remark to suggest that, because it was difficult to determine whether any person, let alone the complainant, was an honest witness, they should pass over that issue and consider whether the person was reliable because this was an easier task to perform. But in truth, if his Honour were correct in his observation about the difficulty of the task in determining honesty, the appropriate advice to be given to the jury was not that they should simply ignore the issue. Rather his Honour should have caused the jury to understand that, despite the apparent difficulty in the task, they had to determine beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was telling the truth before they could convict the appellant of any count on the indictment and, if they found the task too difficult, they had to acquit him. 
     
      
    80 The third reason is perhaps the most significant. His Honour informed the jury that ‘most people who come to court, or a large majority of people who come to court to give evidence as witnesses are not lying’. The jury may well have accepted this statement as a reliable opinion arising from his Honour’s experience as a judge and one that they could safely act upon. They could have taken it to mean that they could ignore the issue of the credibility of the witness because the statistical probability was that she was telling the truth in any event. Whatever might be the reliability of his Honour’s observation about the general credibility of witnesses, there was no occasion for him to impart that information to the jury. The issue was whether the complainant as a particular witness was telling the truth, regardless of what might be said about witnesses in general. 
     
      
    81 It is significant that these statements were not simply comments made by the trial judge about the facts so that the jury would have appreciated that they could accept or reject them as they saw fit. They were given as guidance or advice to the jury as to how they might go about their task in determining whether to act upon the evidence of the complainant. They were said in the context of the jury being cautioned about looking at the evidence of the complainant ‘with great care’ and they followed directly after the jury had been told that his Honour had given the jury a direction of law as to the approach they should take to the evidence of the complainant. The statements carried with them the force of judicial experience. 
     
      
    82 The statement in the last quoted paragraph might not, if it had stood alone, been sufficient to have raised concern. But it emphasised to the jury once again that the issue was not the complainant’s honesty but her reliability and it was said just before the jury retired. 
     
      
    83 No objection was raised at the trial to these passages and the Crown relies upon rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. But if objection had been taken, it is difficult to see what his Honour could have done to redress the situation. Nor was the point taken on appeal until the Court raised it. But in a case where the accused did not give evidence and the principal issue was whether the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s honesty and reliability in relation to her allegations, the passages had the effect of suggesting to the jury that they could find for the Crown on the issue of her credibility and simply decide the case on the reliability of her particular accounts of abuse. This was a serious misdirection and there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    84 Leave should be granted to raise the new ground of appeal and to argue it. The ground has been made out. 
     
      
    85 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Appeal upheld; 
        
       
      
     (2) Convictions and sentences be quashed; (3) Order that a new trial be held.

     REGINA v WRC 
     
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
       
      The Respondent was charged with a number of counts of indecent assault upon a specified male person in contravention of s81 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. At a trial on substantially the same indictment held in November 2000, the jury was unable to reach a verdict and was discharged. The Respondent had also been convicted of similar acts in relation to two other complainants and served some twenty months imprisonment, however in 2002 the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed those convictions and ordered re-trials. The Director of Public Prosecutions has decided that there will be no further proceedings in those matters. On 27 June 2003, Woods DCJ ordered a permanent stay of proceedings on the indictment as an abuse of process, on the ground that the Respondent was unfit to be tried. His Honour concluded that it was neither necessary nor appropriate to invoke the procedure to determine fitness to be tried under the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
       1990 given the circumstances of the Respondent’s condition. The Crown appeals from that decision.

      The legislature, in enacting the

      A permanent stay of criminal proceedings is an exceptional intervention into the processes of the criminal law. Where a specific statutory procedure with a different decision-maker is laid down to determine matters primarily relied upon for the grant of a permanent stay, there will be few circumstances where the operation of that procedure would constitute an abuse of process. Although his Honour purported to apply a test recognising the exceptional character of a stay, he did not give proper consideration to the existence of a system to determine, by jury, the matters upon which he relied to reach his conclusion. His Honour’s exercise of the discretion to order a permanent stay miscarried and should be re-exercised. [55], [56], [59], [60]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. On 27 June 2003, Judge GD Woods QC ordered that an indictment presented against the Respondent be permanently stayed. The Crown appeals from that decision. 
     
      
       
      Decision of Woods DCJ 
       
      
    2 His Honour had before him an indictment containing a number of charges of indecent assault upon a specified male person which constituted offences under s81 of the Crimes Act 1900. Substantially the same indictment had been tried in November 2000, but the jury had been unable to reach a verdict and was discharged. 
     
      
    3 With respect to two other Complainants, alleging similar acts on the part of the Respondent, he had been convicted but, on 7 June 2002, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed those convictions and ordered re-trials (R v WRC [2002] NSWCCA 210). On 31 January 2003, the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that there be no further proceedings in those matters. Prior to the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Respondent had served some twenty months imprisonment towards the sentences imposed on him with respect to those matters. 
     
      
    4 Near the commencement of his judgment and before setting out the evidence, Woods DCJ referred to the psychiatric evidence before him in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The general thrust of the conclusions reached by the psychiatrists, Dr Westmore and Dr Lucire, is that the accused is unfit to be tried at the present time. According to the opinion of Dr Westmore unlikely to be fit to be tried within twelve months.” 
        
       
      
    5 His Honour identified the issues before him as a contention on the part of the accused that the indictment should be permanently stayed as an abuse of process, with the Crown taking the position that the steps required to be taken to determine fitness to be tried under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the Act”) should be allowed to take effect. 
     
      
    6 His Honour noted that he had a number of medical reports before him. This included the reports of a Dr Goddard and a Dr Barraclough, as well as Dr Goldberg, a clinical psychologist. 
     
      
    7 His Honour noted the report of Dr Goddard: 
     
      
       
        
        “Dr Goddard refers to the accused as suffering from cancer in the form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma which that doctor, (an oncology registrar for Dr Paul Kraft, a medical oncologist) describes as an indolent disease: that, of course, means that it is not painful, which is not to say that it is not fatal. According to that oncological report, the disease carries a median survival of about ten years following diagnosis. It is now, according to the report, about six years following diagnosis. The question of life expectancy must be assessed in terms of that material.” 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour noted that Dr Goddard indicated that the short-term prognosis for the Respondent was “quite good”, but as such a tumour tends to become more resistant to treatment over time, his “prognosis over the next few years is more guarded”. Woods DCJ noted that the active condition of lymphoma did affect the Respondent, specifically, his life expectancy. 
     
      
    9 His Honour referred to the report of Dr Barraclough, concerning the Respondent’s ischaemic heart disease. The report noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Has ongoing chest pain which could be angina, occurs with minimal exertion and especially when stressed. He is known to have minor coronary artery disease, ie 30 percent stenosis left anterior descending. This needs further assessment with a cardiologist.” 
        
       
      
    10 Dr Barraclough referred to a recent cerebellar infarction and his Honour described the remarks in this regard as “significant”. They were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Affects balance and cognitive function, has very poor attention span and poor comprehension. He is waiting on a MRI scan for further evaluation and then referral to a neurologist.” 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour referred to the report of Dr Goldberg which concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The cumulative stress of the criminal charges and convictions, and particularly the prison sentence, has exacerbated his stress levels culminating in the most recent stroke of January 2003.” 
        
       
      
    12 The report also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Slow response speed and impaired concentration and attention would make it difficult for him to follow the course of proceedings. Long term memory retrieval is also inefficient and likely to interfere with his ability to be accurate in giving evidence to do with time orientation and sequence of events. Although there would be no difficulty in understanding the charges conceptually he would have difficulty in maintaining concentration, organising his thoughts and planning responses when answering charges or instructing his legal representatives.” 
        
       
      
    13 The report went on to discuss other aspects of the Respondent’s medical condition, including slurred speech, memory problems, blurred vision, disorientation and difficulty in remembering sequences. His Honour noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “The report of the tests she undertook with him indicates extreme impairment in the category of audio-verbal retention, marked impairment in concentration and retrieval in the area of memory. There are other mild and moderate and marked impairments indicated in various other tests, particularly marked impairment in relation to concentration in terms of higher order functions. However, it seems to me that the most significant problem is the difficulties with memory.” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour quoted the clinical psychologist’s conclusion: 
     
      
       
        
        “His general problems with time orientation and poor complex memory could impede his ability to understand the substantial effect of evidence or to answer the charges.” 
        
       
      
    15 Dr Lucire, a psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the Respondent, concluded that the Respondent was not fit to stand trial. 
     
      
    16 Woods DCJ referred to the psychiatric report of Dr Westmore in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Dr Westmore, the psychiatrist commissioned by the Crown to undertake the counterpart investigation, also extensively spoke with the accused. There was no suggestion that Dr Westmore is likely to have been fooled by some impersonation of symptoms and he adduced from the accused several responses which, as explained in the report, indicated that he had been affected by the strokes to a significant degree.” 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour quoted Dr Westmore’s conclusion as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Overall Mr C is in my opinion unfit to be tried. I do not believe that situation is likely to change within the next twelve months. In view of his history, inattention and impaired concentration I think it would be wise to have his driving capacities reassessed to determine whether he remains a safe driver because of the identified difficulties he experiences.” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour noted the nature of the trial, being allegations of sexual assault. He referred to the fact that there had been a hung jury at the previous trial, but said that that factor was not determinative. However, his Honour said, it did serve as a reminder that it was forensically necessary, in a case of this character, for the accused to give evidence explaining his position. His Honour postulated as a “critical question” whether there could be a fair trial in the circumstances. 
     
      
    19 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This man suffers from a painless but no doubt fatal form of cancer. The evidence about life expectancy is that the median point of life expectancy relative to his condition after diagnosis will be reached in about four years from now … Of course it is theoretically possible that, like Mr Hakim, he may linger for decades and still be around in 2030. But decisions by courts can only be taken on the basis of the evidence before them. Regrettably for Mr C it seems wholly unlikely that an extensive life expectancy will be available to him. There has been evidence of angina and there is evidence of the strokes he suffered, one of them being since the first trial. 
        
       
       
        
        My deduction from all of the evidence which I have referred to (and it appears to be the conclusion drawn by both of the psychiatrists) is that the combined effect of his various illnesses impacts severely on his capacity to defend himself in a trial. Both experienced psychiatrists accept that the accused is not presently fit to be tried.” 
        
       
      
    20 This expression of his Honour’s findings of a factual character is of considerable significance. His Honour had referred to other considerations which may be of significance for determining the application for a stay, particularly the heart disease and lymphoma. In his conclusion, however, his Honour focuses on the effect of the illnesses upon the Appellant’s “capacity to defend himself in a trial”. In this passage, which is the culmination of his Honour’s analysis of the facts, he gives primary, indeed determinative, weight to the issue of fitness to be tried. 
     
      
    21 Before Woods DCJ, the Crown submitted that no permanent stay should be granted, but that the Court should make orders to have the matter of fitness determined under the provisions of the Act. The Crown submitted that the issue should properly be dealt with under the Act. The Crown also asserted that it was the intention of Parliament that the Act “cover the field” so that it was not open to the Court to order a stay on those grounds. 
     
      
    22 His Honour referred to R v Hakim (1989) 41 A Crim R 372, a case in which the Court exercised the jurisdiction to stay an indictment at a time when the relevant statutory provision was Pt 11A of the Crimes Act 1900 as inserted by the Crimes (Mental Disorder) Amendment Act 1983. His Honour noted there was no suggestion in Hakim that that statutory provision was intended to cover the field. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “The law of unfitness and stay on the ground of abuse of process overlap to a significant extent, but they are not co-extensive and they are certainly not mutually exclusive.” 
        
       
      
    23 The Crown also drew the attention of Woods DCJ to the decision of Mr Justice Olsson in R v Burns (No 2) (1999) 169 ALR 149. His Honour concluded that the reasoning of Olsson J, in the context of s20B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) was not applicable to the New South Wales legislative regime. 
     
      
    24 His Honour traced the history of the New South Wales legislation. That history is considered more comprehensively by Wood CJ at CL in R v Mailes (2001) 53 NSWLR 251 at [183]-[203]. 
     
      
    25 His Honour concluded that this was not a case where it was either “necessary or appropriate” to invoke the special trial procedures under the legislation and said this was a case very similar to Hakim’s case. He concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that the man who has made the complaint in this case (and who obviously gave evidence in the first trial where there was a hung jury) is prima facie entitled to have his complaints brought before the courts, and prima facie is entitled to have them litigated. The remedy of an order staying prosecution on the ground of abuse of process is a remedy which the courts have repeatedly said is only available in exceptional circumstances and is not to be granted lightly. Before such a remedy is granted, powerful regard has to be had to the normal right of a citizen, and the Crown acting on his behalf, to prosecute for perceived criminal misconduct. That due process of law is not to be stopped lightly and otherwise than in an exceptional case. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, this is such an exceptional case. It seems to me that this case calls for the making of the same order that was made in  
        Hakim 
        , for similar reasons. 
        
       
       
        
        I order that the indictment be permanently stayed. In those circumstances it is unnecessary for me to deal with the question of fitness.” 
        
       
      
    26 This last comment is a reference to the Crown submission that his Honour should make orders to have the issue of fitness determined under the Act. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on the Appeal 
       
      
    27 Mr G Rowling, who appeared for the Appellant, submitted that by relying on the evidence before his Honour, the Respondent raised the question of unfitness to be tried within the meaning of s8(1) of the Act, which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “8(1) If the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised at any time before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Attorney General must determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    28 Mr Rowling submitted that the effect of s8(1) was that it was not open to a judge to proceed with the charges. Whether or not the issue had been “raised”, so that s8(1) was triggered, is a statutory construction issue. Whether the Attorney-General was obliged to make a determination need not be considered. Any such obligation became moot upon his Honour’s order. 
     
      
    29 The Appellant submitted to this Court, as it had before Woods DCJ, that the provisions of the Act “cover the field” of circumstances in which the question of an accused’s fitness to be tried can arise. They provide a statutory remedy for deciding whether an accused is unfit to be tried and apply to the exclusion of other procedures. 
     
      
    30 In the alternative, the Appellant submitted that the remedy of a permanent stay of criminal proceedings was an exceptional one, and by reason of the fact that there were appropriate statutory procedures, there was no occasion for his Honour to order that the proceedings be stayed. 
     
      
    31 Mr R Hulme SC, who appeared for the Respondent, submitted that the Appellant’s contentions, if correct, would mean that the remedy of a permanent stay would be unavailable even in cases of extreme unfairness or oppression, if there was any unresolved question as to the accused’s fitness to be tried. He submitted that in the case of an abuse of process by reason of a prosecution having been brought for an improper purpose or because proceedings were doomed to fail, no stay would be available unless and until any unresolved issues of fitness for trial were determined by the procedures under the Act. 
     
      
    32 Mr Hulme submitted that Pt 2 of the Act is not a statutory scheme which supplants the common law. It was intended, he submitted, to operate alongside the common law. He relied on the principle that a statute is not to be construed as abrogating fundamental common law principles unless the intention to do so is manifest. He submitted that nothing in the terms of Pt 2 of the Act contain any such manifest intention. 
     
      
    33 He submitted that it was open to his Honour to conclude that the combination of the matters to which his Honour referred were such that a permanent stay was appropriate in the exercise of a broad discretion. He submitted that his Honour’s references to issues which overlap with a fitness inquiry may have indicated that these were the primary considerations, but they were not the only considerations to which he had regard. Mr Hulme also invoked the well known restrictions on an appellate court interfering with a discretionary decision. 
     
      
       
      The Legislative Scheme 
       
      
    34 Part 2 of the Act, by its title, is concerned with criminal proceedings “relating to persons affected by mental disorders”. The opening section of the part identifies its application to the Supreme Court and the District Court (s4). The next section indicates the trigger for the operation of the scheme. 
     
      
       
        
        “5. The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence may be raised by any party to the proceedings in respect of the offence or by the court.” 
        
       
      
    35 The terminology of matters of fitness being “raised” continues in subsequent sections: 
     
      
    · The question of fitness is to be raised “so far as practicable” before arraignment, but it may be raised at any time (s7). 
     
      
    · Where the question is raised before arraignment, the Attorney is to determine whether an inquiry should be conducted (s8). 
     
      
    · If the issue of fitness is raised after arraignment, the court must hear submissions on the conduct of an inquiry in the absence of the jury (s9). 
     
      
    · Where the Attorney determines an inquiry should be conducted, or the question of the person’s fitness is raised after arraignment, the court must save in specific situations, conduct an inquiry into fitness (s10). 
     
      
    36 Sections 11 and 11A are of significance. By s11 a jury, constituted for the specific purpose, is to determine the issue of unfitness to be tried. By s11A(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “11A(1)The question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by the Judge alone if the person so elects in accordance with this section and the Judge is satisfied that the person, before making the election, sought and received advice in relation to the election from a barrister or solicitor. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) An election may be made only with the consent of the prosecutor. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person who elects to have the question determined by the Judge alone may, at any time before the date fixed for the determination of the person’s unfitness to be tried, subsequently elect to have the question determined by a jury. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The Judge may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the person’s unfitness to be tried. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a finding of a jury. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Any determination by the Judge under this section must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Rules of court may be made with respect to elections under this section.” 
        
       
      
    37 These sections indicate a legislative intention that the issue of fitness should be determined by the usual method of trial on indictment in the superior courts, i.e. trial by jury. 
     
      
    38 Where, following an inquiry, a person is found fit to be tried, the proceedings are to recommence (s13). However, where a person is found to be unfit, certain consequences ensue, including a reference to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (ss14 and 15). 
     
      
    39 Where the Mental Health Review Tribunal determines that a person will not, on the balance of probability, become fit to be tried during the period of twelve months after the finding of unfitness, the Attorney General may direct a special hearing be conducted. The purpose of the special hearing is to determine whether it can be proved, on the limited evidence available and to the requisite criminal standard, that the person committed the offence. Thereafter the judge may indicate the sentence which the court would have considered appropriate if there had been a normal trial. Other provision is also made for the consequences of the finding of unfitness. (See generally ss18-28) 
     
      
       
       
      The Jurisdiction Issue 
       
      
    40 The Appellant relied on observations of Mr Justice Olsson in R v Burns (No 2). In that case an issue considered was whether or not there remained scope for the operation of common law principles or did the matters of fitness that arose in that case fall to be considered “solely within the purview of s20B of the Crimes Act 1914, Commonwealth”. 
     
      
    41 The issue was whether or not Division 6, in which s20B appeared, operated to the exclusion of the inherent power of the court at common law to stay proceedings where those proceedings “would be unacceptably oppressive and unfair to an accused”. (See [19]-[20]). 
     
      
    42 Olsson J concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[36] … It seems to me that, in relation to the types of federal offence to which it applies, it [Division 6 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1914 (Cth)] effectively ousts the operation of the common law inherent powers of the court to grant a permanent stay on the ground of existing unfitness to be tried. 
        
       
       
        
        [37] In so saying I do not intend to imply that Div 6 also operates so as to cover situations in which a trial judge may need to consider relatively short term adjournment or other measures to meet transient conditions of an accused’s incapacity arising during the course of a trial, including the power to sever or to continue the trial in the absence of an accused in proper cases. It seems to me that Div 6 is essentially pre-occupied with potential long term scenarios which can truly fall within the rubric of unfitness to be tried in the absolute sense.” 
        
       
      
    43 This conclusion was based on a consideration of a statutory scheme of Div 6 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, which is not the same as Pt 2 of the Act. It is not, however, necessary to consider whether the differences are relevant. 
     
      
    44 Mr Hulme SC drew the Court’s attention to the subsequent history of the matter considered R v Burns (No 2). The person who failed in the application for permanent stay subsequently made another application. The application was refused, but a jury was empanelled to determine the question of fitness and returned a verdict that the accused was fit to be tried. An appeal from the refusal to order a stay, as well as an appeal against the jury verdict that he was not unfit, came before the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court in R v Sexton (2000) 76 SASR 534. The matter was not resolved then, as it was regarded as appropriate to require the trial judge to state a case. 
     
      
    45 The matter returned to the Full Court in R v Sexton (2000) 77 SASR 405. Gray J, with whom Prior and Williams JJ agreed, referred to the observation quoted above by Olsson J in para [36] of his reasoning, to the effect that the scheme ousts the operation of the common law inherent power to grant permanent stay. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[35] In my view this proposition is not correct. A statute is not to be construed as abrogating fundamental common law principles unless that is manifestly clear from its terms or it is a matter of necessary implication. There is nothing in s 20B to suggest that the inherent jurisdiction of the court to grant a permanent stay has been abrogated.” 
        
       
      
    46 There is, accordingly, no authority in favour of the Appellant’s contention under the analogous Commonwealth legislation. In any event, the State scheme must be considered on its own terms. 
     
      
    47 Part 2 contains a carefully constructed scheme for determining issues of fitness to be tried, which is comprehensive in its scope. That does not, however, mean that it is intended to be exclusive, in the sense of a mini-code, which operates to the exclusion of any other circumstance in which an issue capable of being characterised as raising a question of fitness to be tried may be determined in the course of criminal proceedings. Specifically, I see nothing in the statutory scheme that suggests that it should be understood to exclude the inherent power of a superior court to control its own processes and, particularly, its power to control abuse of its processes. As the majority joint judgment said in Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 392-393 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness.” 
        
       
      
    48 Whether the Parliament of New South Wales has the ability to pass laws to prevent a superior court exercising criminal jurisdiction from exercising its inherent jurisdiction to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process, is a matter that could raise issues under the Commonwealth Constitution. No such issue has arisen during the course of argument in this case. 
     
      
    49 For present purposes, it is sufficient to rely on the principle of the law of statutory interpretation that a legislature will not be taken to overturn a fundamental principle of the administration of justice without expressing itself with pellucid clarity. (See e.g. Potter v Minahan (1908) 7 CLR 277 at 304; Bropho v Western Australia (1991) 171 CLR 1 at 17-18). There is a strong presumption that the legislature does not intend to abrogate the inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to control abuse of its processes. 
     
      
    50 Part 2 is concerned with a particular range of matters. Such matters may arise in combination with matters not within its scope, in the context of alleged abuse of the processes of a court. Nothing in Pt 2 of the Act suggests, let alone states with sufficient clarity, that the Parliament intended to impinge on the implied jurisdiction of the District Court or the inherent jurisdiction of this Court, in this regard. The presumption to which I have referred is not overcome. The Appellant’s contention that his Honour had no jurisdiction to make the order that he did make, on the basis that Pt 2 of the Act covered the relevant field, should be rejected. 
     
      
       
       
      Did His Honour Commit a Legal Error? 
       
      
    51 Woods DCJ relied on the decision of this Court in R v Hakim (1989) 41 A Crim R 372. In that case, Lee J ordered a stay on medical grounds based on the accused’s long history of ischaemic heart disease. No issue arose as to the application of the predecessor provisions of Pt 2 of the Act. It does not appear that the decision of Lee J was based on fitness considerations of the character with which Pt 2 of the Act is concerned. There was reference in the reasoning in that case to the effect that illness had had on the memory of the accused (at 376.6). However, the thrust of the judgment was directed to what Lee J described as the “deplorable medical condition” of the accused. (See at 376.9) 
     
      
    52 The test which Lee J applied, affirmed on appeal, was that in the light of the deterioration of the accused’s medical condition it “would be out of accord with common humanity” to allow the charges to proceed. In this respect, Kirby P noted that “he has already to some extent suffered prejudice in regard to his memory from the passage of time between the commission of the alleged offence and now”. (At 377.3) However, that did not appear to be the decisive consideration. 
     
      
    53 His Honour’s conclusion, that to allow the charges to proceed would constitute an abuse of the process of the Court, was not disturbed by the Court of Appeal. Kirby P, with whom Gleeson CJ and Clark JA relevantly agreed, concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “If, as Lee J found, it would offend common humanity to now require Mr Hakim to stand trial on the further charge of conspiracy, it was open to Lee J to stay the proceedings upon that charge. It will be a rare case that intervening illness or the physical or mental condition of the accused will bring the court to that conclusion. But Lee J was brought to it. And I would not disturb that conclusion on the facts of this case.” 
        
       
      
    54 Since the judgment of this Court in Hakim, the High Court has explained the jurisdiction in terms consistent with that judgment, but elaborating upon it in certain respects. (Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23; Walton v Gardiner.) No narrow view of an abuse of process is appropriate. 
     
      
    55 A permanent stay of criminal proceedings is a wholly exceptional intervention into the processes of the criminal law. The public interest in ensuring that persons charged with crimes are tried is entitled to significant weight in the necessary balancing process. (See e.g. Jago at 30 and 49-50.) Because of this, as Mason CJ said in Jago at 34: 
     
      
       
        
        “a permanent stay should be ordered only in an extreme case.” 
        
       
      
    56 Woods DCJ purported to apply a test of “exceptional circumstances”. However, his Honour did not in my opinion, give proper consideration and weight to the existence of a system for determining the matters upon which he primarily relied to reach his conclusion. In Pt 2 of the Act, the Parliament has indicated that, in accordance with the normal procedures for trial of serious offences, issues of this character should usually be determined by a jury. His Honour arrogated to a judge the very function which the Parliament has indicated should be performed by a jury, as representative of the community. 
     
      
    57 It is not entirely clear what weight his Honour gave to the kinds of medical considerations that determined the outcome in Hakim. His Honour did say that the case before him was similar to Hakim’s case, however, at the time that he expressed his relevant finding, he did so in the terms quoted above, i.e. “the combined effect of his various illnesses impact severely on his capacity to defend himself in a trial.” This conclusion, in large measure, if not exclusively, is concerned with matters that would arise in a fitness hearing in accordance with the well established approach to deciding that issue in Australia. (See R v Presser [1958] VR 45 esp at 48; Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 esp at 244; Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1 esp at [59]-[64]; [294], [332]; Mailes at [112]-[181]. Indeed the psychiatric reports of Dr Lucire and Dr Westmore, upon which his Honour relied, applied what the authors described as “the Presser criteria”. 
     
      
    58 His Honour’s approach to the alternative under Pt 2 was to assert, without elaboration of reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        “this is not a case where it is necessary or appropriate to have reference to the special trial procedure to the exclusion of the remedy [of a permanent stay].” 
        
       
      
    59 In this reasoning, his Honour failed to give weight to the existence of an alternative mechanism, to be determined by a jury, for deciding the very matters upon which his Honour primarily relied to reach his conclusion that this was one of those exceptional cases in which a permanent stay was appropriate. Where, as here, a specific statutory procedure with a different decision-maker, is laid down for the determination of the matter primarily relied upon for purposes of a permanent stay, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances in which it would be appropriate to find that the continuation of proceedings, which will involve the determination of that question by that procedure, should at that point be stayed, on the basis that any further proceedings would constitute an abuse of process. The Court should permit the special procedure to operate in accordance with its terms, unless there is some overwhelming reason for not allowing that to happen. There was no evidence of that character before his Honour. The medical evidence was not of that character. 
     
      
    60 His Honour purported to exercise a general unfettered discretion to decide whether a stay should be granted. However, with respect to the matters on which his Honour primarily relied, the discretion was not entirely unfettered because significant weight had to be given to the fact that a mechanism to resolve that issue was available. His Honour did not give that consideration appropriate weight and the discretion miscarried. This Court should re-exercise the discretion. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    61 In my opinion, on the facts found by his Honour, a permanent stay should not be ordered. The continuation of proceedings, which would necessarily, as a next step, involve the application of Pt 2 of the Act, is not an abuse of the processes of the court. 
     
      
    62 The other considerations, on the evidence before the Court do not, in my opinion, indicate that it would be an affront to “common humanity” to require Mr C to face a trial. The “median” life expectancy of ten years from diagnosis is a median, i.e. half of all persons have a longer life expectancy. The evidence of heart disease indicates a degree of risk of a character which is not particularly significant or unusual. 
     
      
    63 There is evidence that his ability to mount a defence is affected. This case proceeded on the basis that Pt 2 of the Act would be available to determine that issue. It should be allowed to operate so that the issue is determined by a jury, unless s11A of the Act is invoked. 
     
      
    64 In my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the order made by Woods DCJ should be set aside. 
     
      
    65 DUNFORD J: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    66 HIDDEN J: I agree with Spigelman CJ.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
      
     1  
     JAMES J 
     : Timothy Adam Newton has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 6 December 2002 by his Honour Judge Berman of senior counsel.  
      
       
      
     2 His Honour sentenced the applicant for three offences to all of which the applicant had pleaded guilty, namely:  
      
      
       
       1. Two offences committed on 24 October 2001, one of maliciously damaging property, being an offence under s 195 of the  
       Crimes Act  
       for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years, and the other of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, being an offence under s 58 of the  
       Crimes Act, 
        for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. These two offences had been charged in an indictment on which the applicant had been arraigned.  
       
      
      
       
       2. An offence committed on 9 June 2002 of using an offensive weapon to avoid apprehension, an offence under s 33B(1) of the  
       Crimes Act 
       , 
         
       for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twelve years.  
        
       
      
     3 In sentencing the applicant for the last offence, Judge Berman took into account three further offences committed on 9 June 2002 which were:  
      
       
        
       (1) An offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. 
        
       (2) An offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order.  
        
       (3) An offence of common assault.  
        
       
      
     4 The applicant had been committed for sentence from a Local Court on the charge of using an offensive weapon to avoid apprehension.  
      
      
     5 For the offence of maliciously damaging property committed on 24 October 2001, his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months. For the offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty which was committed on 24 October 2001, his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of two years. For the offence of using an offensive weapon to avoid apprehension which was committed on 9 June 2002, his Honour imposed a sentence of four years with a non-parole period of two years.  
      
      
     6 His Honour ordered that the first two sentences commence from 7 May 2002. The applicant had been continuously in custody referable to these three offences from the time he was arrested on 9 June 2002 but his Honour back-dated the commencement of the sentences for the offences committed on 24 October 2001 to 7 May 2002, so as to allow for a discrete period of pre-sentence custody between 24 October 2001, when the applicant had been arrested for committing the first two offences, and 27 November 2001, when he had been released on bail. The offences committed on 9 June 2002 were committed whilst the applicant was on this bail. His Honour ordered that the sentence for the offence under s 33B committed on 9 June 2002 should commence from 7 May 2003, thus making that sentence partly cumulative on the sentences for the offences committed on 24 October 2001 The total effect of the sentences was that the applicant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling five years with a non-parole period of three years. 
      
      
     7 The facts of the offences can be briefly stated as follows. The applicant and a woman who I will refer to simply as SH had been in a relationship for about eight years. SH had applied for an apprehended domestic violence order against the applicant and the application had been set down for hearing on 24 October 2001. On the morning of 24 October 2001 SH began to make preparations to attend the court at which her application would be heard. The applicant became aware of what SH was doing. He spoke abusively to her and made threats to her. SH got into her car. The applicant took the keys of the car, got a baseball bat from inside the house and, using the baseball bat, smashed the driver’s side front window of the car. This conduct was the subject of the charge of maliciously damaging property. SH ran from the house and attended the court, where she obtained an apprehended domestic violence order.  
      
       
      
     8 It was determined by police that service of the apprehended domestic violence order should be undertaken with the assistance of the State Protection Group. At about 6 o’clock in the evening of 24 October 2001 negotiaters from the State Protection Group asked the applicant to come out of the house. The applicant refused. His Honour in his statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence recorded that the applicant armed himself with a firework, walked from the house and fired the firework at police. The firework exploded. The conduct of the applicant in projecting the firework was the basis, or part of the basis, of the charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. A statement by a police officer named Poole was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence in which Constable Poole said that, apart from the firework, which was referred to in paragraph 4 of Constable Poole’s statement, the applicant had discharged an explosive device like a Roman candle (para 5 of Constable Poole’s statement) and another firework (para 6 of Constable Poole’s statement).  
      
      
     9 As indicated earlier in this judgment, the applicant was arrested on 24 October 2001 but was released on bail on 27 November 2001. While on bail for the offences committed on 24 October 2001, the applicant committed the offences of 9 June 2002.  
      
      
     10 On 9 June 2002 police went to the same premises where the applicant and SH lived, after SH had made an emergency call. The applicant refused to allow police to enter the house and made abusive and threatening remarks to the police. Among other things, he said:  
      
      
       
        
         
         “You’ll fucking need an army. There is going to be another siege. You aren’t coming in here you fucking coppers.” 
         
        
       
      
     11 At one stage the applicant appeared at the door of the house with a knife in his hand. On a number of subsequent occasions he appeared with a knife in his hand. Constable Poole managed to enter the house and after a struggle with the applicant succeeded in taking the knife from the applicant. The applicant’s use of the knife grounded the charge under s 33B of the  
     Crimes Act 
     . The applicant continued to struggle with police inside the house and later at a police station.  
      
      
     12 The applicant’s conduct in the struggle with Constable Poole led to the charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, which was one of the offences taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the offence under s 33B.  
      
       
      
     13 Earlier in the day the applicant had breached the apprehended domestic violence order which SH had obtained and had assaulted SH. This conduct by the applicant grounded the other two offences which were taken into account when sentencing the applicant for the offence under s 33B. 
      
       
      
     14 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted the subjective features of the applicant. The applicant had had a dysfunctional childhood and had what his Honour described as a quite lengthy criminal history. He had had a “volatile” relationship with SH for about eight years. His Honour referred to a report from Dr Westmore, psychiatrist, which his Honour considered was particularly relevant in two respects, namely:  
      
      
       
       1. The applicant became aggressive after he had been drinking alcohol. 
        
       2. The applicant had a personality disorder which was most appropriately described as an adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. 
       
      
      
     15 His Honour accepted that general deterrence has less of a role to play when sentencing an offender whose mental functioning is impaired. However, his Honour considered that in sentencing the applicant there was a strong need for a sentence to be imposed which would operate as a personal deterrent to the applicant. His Honour specifically referred to the offences on 9 June 2002 having been committed while the applicant was on bail and to the applicant’s challenge to police on 9 June 2002, that the police would need an army to subdue him and that there would be another siege. His Honour also found that the applicant had not shown any remorse and his Honour held that the absence of any remorse increased the need for sentences to be imposed which would operate as a personal deterrent to the applicant. His Honour allowed a discount of twenty-five per cent for the early pleas of guilty. His Honour found special circumstances within s 44(2) of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      in the need to encourage the applicant to seek and receive psychiatric help.  
      
       
      
     16 Two separate sets of written submissions referring to various grounds of appeal were filed on behalf of the applicant but we were informed by senior counsel at the hearing of the application that the grounds of appeal relied on by the applicant were the first three grounds in written submissions dated 25 October 2003. I will deal with these grounds of appeal in turn.  
      
       
      
     17  
     Ground 1: The sentencing judge took into account facts not relied upon by the Crown in relation to the charge.  
      
       
      
     18 In his statement of the facts of the offence under s 58 of the  
     Crimes Act 
      committed on 24 October 2001, his Honour said that the applicant armed himself with two large knives and that he brandished those knives at police. These words in his Honour’s remarks on sentence were taken verbatim by his Honour from a statement of the facts of the offences committed on 24 October 2001, which had been admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence without any objection from the legal representative of the applicant in the proceedings on sentence. 
      
       
      
     19 It was submitted on the hearing of this application that his Honour should not have had any regard to the facts that the applicant had armed himself with a knife (or knives) and had brandished the knife (or knives) at police, because during the argument in the proceedings on sentence the sentencing judge had said to the Crown’s representative: 
      
      
       
        
         
         “The assault that you rely on, Mr Crown, is one continuing episode involving the discharge of some fireball in paragraph 4 of Poole’s statement, with a Roman candle type thing in paragraph 5, and the cracker in paragraph 6. They are all part of the assault, are they?” 
         
        
        
       The Crown’s representative had agreed with what was put by his Honour. 
       
      
      
     20 It was submitted that it was apparent from his Honour’s remarks on sentence that his Honour had attached some significance to the applicant having armed himself with a knife or knives and having brandished them, because, apart from including those facts in his recitation of the facts of the offences, his Honour had expressly stated that he did not accept the applicant’s denial made to a Probation and Parole officer, which was recorded in a pre-sentence report made by the officer, that he had armed himself with knives and brandished them. 
      
       
      
     21 I do not consider that this ground of appeal should be upheld, even if the assault by the applicant should be regarded as restricted to the discharging of the fireworks as described in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of Constable Poole’s statement. As I have already stated, there was no objection by the applicant’s legal representative to the tender of the statement of the facts of the offences which included these facts or to the tender of the statement of Constable Poole, which, subject to a qualification which I will come to later in this judgment, included those facts. 
      
      
     22 Those acts of the applicant in arming himself with a knife or knives and brandishing the knife or knives were part of what happened during the continuing episode and, even if not constituting part of the actual assault relied on by the Crown, were relevant to assessing the objective gravity of the actual assault committed by the applicant, particularly by way of illuminating the applicant’s state of mind during the continuing episode and his defiance of the police, which were matters the sentencing judge could properly take into account, particularly in considering the degree to which the need for personal deterrence should be given effect to in the sentencing of the applicant.  
      
       
      
     23 The entitlement, and indeed the obligation of a sentencing judge to take into account all of the circumstances in which an offence has been committed, is subject to the principle stated in  
     The Queen v De Simoni 
      (1980-1981) 147 CLR 383. However, I do not discern any breach of the principles in  
     De Simoni 
      in what the sentencing judge did in the present case. 
      
       
      
     24 A further point was taken that, although the statement of the facts of the offences admitted into evidence from which his Honour took his statement of the facts of the offences in his remarks on sentence, referred to two knives, Constable Poole’s statement, which was the primary source of the facts of the offences, referred to only one knife, albeit a knife which the applicant produced on a number of separate occasions during the siege. It would seem to be correct that, according to Constable Poole’s statement, the applicant produced only one knife, which Constable Poole described as a very large carving knife, and that the statement of the facts of the offences admitted into evidence and his Honour’s remarks on sentence are incorrect in asserting the applicant produced two knives. However, I am of the opinion there is not really any material difference between an assertion that the applicant armed himself with two large knives, which he brandished, and an assertion that on a number of different occasions during the siege the applicant armed himself with the same large knife, which he brandished.  
      
       
      
     25 I would reject the first ground of appeal.  
      
       
      
     26  
     Ground 2: The sentencing judge, having previously accepted a view of the facts favourable to the appellant changed his mind and took a more serious view of the facts, without informing the appellant before passing sentence 
     .  
      
      
     27 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
          
         “At about 8.30pm on 24 October 2001, the accused armed himself with a firework. He walked from the residence and fired a projectile at police. A fireball exploded and Senior Constable Poole felt intense heat from the explosion upon his face and a shock wave of the explosion against his body. He said that the noise was deafening and it caused him immediate pain and ringing to his ears. The projectile consisted of an explosive based substance. One such projectile was found to have penetrated the ground area in close proximity to police personnel. The offender carried out this action on two further occasions.” 
         
        
        
       This part of his Honour’s remarks on sentence was taken virtually verbatim from the statement of the facts of the offences which had been admitted without objection in the proceedings on sentence.  
        
         
       
      
     28 It was submitted that what his Honour said in this part of his remarks on sentence departed from what his Honour had earlier said in the course of the argument in the proceedings on sentence. In response to a submission made by the applicant’s legal representative that the discharge of fireworks had not caused any injury to Constable Poole, his Honour had said: 
      
       
        
         
         “So, didn’t suffer, did not cause injury. Okay, well, I’ll proceed on the basis that it was an improvised weapon and all that was used was a firework and I know what they do.” 
         
        
        
       
      
     29 It was submitted that what his Honour said in his remarks on sentence represented a change from what his Honour had said in argument, that his Honour had not informed the applicant’s legal representative of his change of mind and that thereby the applicant had been denied procedural fairness.  
      
      
     30 I do not consider that there is any substance at all in this ground of appeal. There was no departure whatever by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence from what his Honour had said in argument or, indeed, from what was contained in the statement of the facts of the offences which had been admitted without objection. In the part of his remarks on sentence following the part which has just been quoted, his Honour recorded that no one had actually been injured. In both what his Honour had said in argument and in what his Honour said in his remarks on sentence, his Honour distinguished between the heat, shock and ringing in his ears experienced by Constable Poole as a result of the explosion of the projectile on the one hand and, on the other hand, the inflicting of actual injury.  
      
      
     31 There being no departure by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence from what he had said in argument, there was no denial of procedural fairness. 
      
      
     32  
     Ground 3: The sentencing judge failed to apply the principle of totality in relation to the matters dealt with on sentence.  
      
      
     33 It was submitted that the sentencing judge had failed to apply the sentencing principle of totality in the determination of the sentences which he imposed. Counsel referred to the guideline judgment concerning the taking of offences into account in sentencing for a principal offence –  
     the Attorney General’s application under s 57 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1997 
       
     No 1  
     (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. It was submitted that the offences to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the offence committed on 9 June 2002 were so inextricably bound up with the principal offence that there should have been no increase in penalty for the principal offence by reason of the offences to be taken into account. 
      
      
     34 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge did not indicate, and he was not required to indicate, the extent, if at all, to which the sentence for the principal offence committed on 9 June 2002 had been increased by reason of the offences to be taken into account. 
      
      
     35 In his remarks on sentence his Honour rejected a submission that the criminality in the principal offence was “at the lower end of the scale” and I would infer that the sentence his Honour imposed for the principal offence was mainly, if not entirely, attributable to the criminality in the principal offence and his Honour gave little weight to the offences to be taken into account. His Honour would have been entitled to give some weight at least to the offences of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order and assaulting SH, which were quite distinct from the commission of the offence under s 33B. In my opinion, this ground of appeal is not made out. 
      
       
      
     36 It was put in oral argument that the sentences were manifestly excessive but having regard to the objective facts of the offences and the subjective features of the applicant to which I have already referred, I would reject that submission.  
      
       
      
     37 In my opinion leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       - On application to examine witnesses prior to commencement of trial; see p 26 of transcript 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: There is before the Court an application for an order for the examination of witnesses at a preliminary hearing prior to the commencement of the trial. 
     
      
    2 On 2 February 2004, an indictment was presented against each of the accused and each was arraigned on that occasion. The indictment charges that Ida Ronen, Nitzan Ronen and Izhar Ronen, between about 1 October 1991 and 15 September 1995, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with each other to defraud the Commonwealth, namely the Commissioner of Taxation, contrary to s 86A of the Crimes Act 1914. There is a further charge that Ida Ronen, Nitzan Ronen and Izhar Ronen, between about 16 September 1995 and 5 February 2001, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did conspire with each other and George Segal to commit an offence against s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914, that is to defraud the Commonwealth, namely the Commissioner of Taxation, contrary to s 86(2) of the Crimes Act 1914. 
     
      
    3 Each of the accused has pleaded not guilty to the charges in the indictment. 
     
      
    4 The trial is scheduled to commence in early March 2004. 
     
      
    5 The nature of the Crown case may be briefly stated. It is set out, however, in more detail in a document that has been placed before me described as an overview of the Crown case. 
     
      
    6 In essence, the case involves an allegation of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth of income tax between 1991 and February 2001, involving income generated by four retail outlets associated with the accused. In one fashion or another, each of the accused were or are directors and shareholders of a number of companies involved in the retail and wholesale clothing industry. Dolina Enterprises, Dolina Fashion Group and a joint venture (all collectively known as ""Dolina Australia"") were involved in the manufacture and sale of garment retailing through major outlets such as Coles/Myer, David Jones and Rockmans. These sales, in the main, did not involve cash sales.  
     
      
    7 However, in addition to the sale at the major outlets, Nitzan and Izhar through their companies supplied garments to four smaller retail outlets. These were managed by their mother, the accused Mrs Ida Ronen. Those outlets retailed garments to the public generally. The retail outlets were Ronen Young Fashions at 216-224 Commonwealth Street, Surry Hills; Dolina On Fovo at 17-51 Foveaux Street, Surry Hills; Fashion Bargains at 1-15 Foveaux Street, Surry Hills; and Warehouse at 132-142 Epsom Road, Rosebery. The last three businesses returned their income for income tax purposes through On Fovo Pty Limited. The income of Ronen Young Fashions was returned in the tax return of Mrs Ida Ronen.  
     
      
    8 As I understand the Crown case, it is said that customers of the four retail outlets paid for the garments by cheque, EFTPOS, credit or cash. The gravamen of the offence is that Mrs Ronen, on behalf of herself and her sons, skimmed from the takings most, if not all, of the cash and diverted it to other purposes. For example, it is alleged that at the time that the skim of cash takings was brought to a halt in February 2001, only 10 percent was being banked and the remaining 90 percent was distributed directly to the Ronens.  
     
      
    9 There is no reason for me at this stage to detail the way the alleged skim took place. It is the Crown case, however, that it took place at Mrs Ronen's own premises at Thornton Street, Darling Point, and that records were kept at her apartment showing the actual takings of each retail outlet. The reduced amount of cash, together with cheques, would then be sent to be deposited at the bank through employees of the Dolina Group. The amounts returned by On Fovo Pty Limited and Mrs Ronen represented only the moneys banked and not the larger amounts of cash skimmed and kept by or on behalf of each of the accused.  
     
      
    10 The Crown case is based in part on a significant body of material that was seized on 7 February 2001 by way of search warrant. There are also a significant number of telephone calls intercepted, the intercepts centring on Mrs Ronen's home telephone at her premises at Darling Point. There is, of course, other evidence, but I need not pause to detail it at this stage.  
     
      
    11 The particular matter requiring a ruling by the Court at this preliminary stage arises in somewhat unusual circumstances. The argument is centred on two or possibly three material witnesses in the trial. The first of these is Jennifer Lawler. As I understand it, she is currently a payroll clerk employed by the Dolina Australia Group. She has been since February 1994 the Group's payroll clerk. In addition, she has had the task of recording and paying expenses and making deposits on behalf of Ronen Young Fashions and On Fovo Pty Limited.  
     
      
    12 In that capacity it appears she has received instructions and directions from Mrs Ida Ronen. These directions included, following receipt of cash from Mrs Ida Ronen, the writing of bank deposit slips in a National Australia Bank deposit book. Mrs Lawler's duties also have included from time to time entering payments and deposits for these companies into a MYOB software package.  
     
      
    13 Miss Lawler provided a statement to the ACC dated 13 March 2001. This forms part of the prosecution brief. No application was made for the cross-examination of Miss Lawler at the committal which took place in March 2003. She has been subpoenaed to give evidence in the trial and is plainly, from the Crown perspective, a material witness. Between September and November 2003 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, whom I will refer to as the CDPP, has endeavoured to confer with Miss Lawler in relation to her statement and the evidence she is likely to give at the trial. The steps taken have not been successful in securing her attendance at conference. Those step are outlined in the affidavit of Penelope Mary Musgrave sworn 26 November 2003.  
     
      
    14 Miss Musgrave said that on 13 October, following a letter sent from the CDPP to Miss Lawler in the preceding month, she spoke to Miss Lawler on the telephone and asked her whether she was available for conference. Miss Lawler said, ""Is it compulsory?"" Miss Musgrave told her it was not. At the end of this conversation, Miss Lawler apparently told Miss Musgrave she would telephone her later to arrange a suitable time for a conference. Subsequently, an appointment was arranged to conference her with prosecuting counsel, the proposed conference date and time being 12 November 2003 at 9am. A letter was sent to Miss Lawler confirming these arrangements.  
     
      
    15 Miss Musgrave received an email from Miss Lawler late in the afternoon of the day prior to the proposed conference. The email is in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        ""In reference to our meeting tomorrow morning I will not be attending. If you have any questions that you would like to ask me, please fax a list"" to a fax number that was set out in the email.”  
        
       
      
    16 On 14 November 2003, Miss Musgrave was informed by Miss Wade, an ACC case officer, that Mr Stevenson, an investigator with the ACC, had received a telephone call from a solicitor whose name was Mr John Laxon. Mr Laxon said that he had received instructions to act for Jennifer Lawler. Miss Musgrave spoke to Mr Laxon on the telephone on 17 November. He confirmed to her that he was acting for Miss Lawler, and that she did not wish to attend a conference. Miss Musgrave asked why it was that she was unable to attend a conference with prosecuting counsel. Mr Laxon said he did not have complete instructions so as to be able to answer that question. She then asked him to obtain those instructions and in fact emailed Mr Laxon on 19 November confirming this conversation. As I understand it, Miss Musgrave has not heard further from Mr Laxon in that regard. 
     
      
    17 It appears that Miss Lawler's position has remained unaltered since that time. There is no direct evidence as to why Miss Lawler has refused to be involved in the interview with the legal representatives of the Crown. Mr Rickter of Queen's Counsel has suggested that perhaps Miss Lawler's attitude may be simply that she does not want to be a party to ""downing"" the accused, particularly in the light of her continued employment with the Dolina Group. All this is purely speculative and there is no hard evidence before me as to why Miss Lawler has taken the stance she has.  
     
      
    18 I turn now to the position of Mr Ian Geller, the second material witness. He is a chartered accountant with Krochmalik & Hurwitz Accountants who carry on practice at 30 Carrington Street, Sydney. That firm provided during the period of the alleged conspiracy, and continues to provide, accounting services to the accused. Mr Geller provided a brief and non-contentious statement to the ACC dated 10 April 2001. There was a second statement dated 17 September 2001. It, however, principally annexes certain documents.  
     
      
    19 Prior to the commencement of the committal in this matter on 10 March 2003, attempts were made by the ACC to conference Mr Geller. Letters were written in February 2003 by the ACC to Krochmalik & Hurwitz. On 28 February 2003 the ACC received a letter from the accountants, on behalf of Mr Geller, in which he declined to attend a conference unless compelled by law to do so. Attached to that letter was a copy of a letter to Mr Geller and also to his partner, Mr Hurwitz. This copy letter was from Mrs Ida Ronen's solicitors, Watsons, and was dated 27 February 2003. The copy letter is quite a long one and I do not propose to set it out in full detail.  
     
      
    20 The letter to Mr Geller from Watsons informed him that the request that he attend the conference was an informal request which he was entirely free to decline “without repercussions”. There were a number of other matters raised in the letter but on page 2 Mr Geller was reminded by Watsons that he was bound by certain obligations of confidentiality not to disclose to any third party any matter whatsoever pertaining to the Ronens and On Fovo Pty Limited. The letter specifically pointed out to Mr Geller that this extended to “all matters that had been indicated in the ACC letter as matters which Mr Goodchild had wanted to question him about”. I should add that Mr Ken Goodchild was at that time, as I understand it, the Director of Financial Investigations at the Australian Crime Commission. On page 3 of the letter, Watsons continued by reminding Mr Geller that any breach by him of his fiduciary and contractual obligations by providing information to Mr Goodchild or otherwise to the ACC without permission would render him liable to the Ronens and On Fovo Pty Limited. It would put in serious question his character for professional purposes and his fitness to hold particular professional qualifications and registrations and would expose him to disciplinary action. There was then subsequent correspondence between the CDPP and Watsons. I do not think I need set that out in detail.  
     
      
    21 The committal took place but no application was made for the cross-examination of Mr Geller at committal. On 13 August 2003 a subpoena was served on Mr Geller for his attendance to give evidence at the trial. On 3 September 2003 a request was sent to Mr Geller by the CDPP requesting his attendance at a conference with prosecuting counsel. On 15 October 2003, Miss Musgrave spoke to Mr Geller by telephone. Mr Geller said in relation to his availability to attend a conference: ""If they give me the okay then I have no problem, but I have been instructed by the defence not to speak to you.""  
     
      
    22 So it was that on 18 November 2003 Miss Musgrave again wrote to Mr Geller requesting his attendance at a conference with the prosecution. On 21 November 2003 a response was received by the CDPP from Krochmalik & Hurwitz, in which Mr Geller declined to attend the conference “unless compelled by law to do so”. Attached to that letter is a copy of a letter to Mr Geller, and also to his partner Mr Hurwitz, from Mrs Ida Ronen's solicitors Watsons dated 21 November 2003. On the same day the CDPP received a letter from Watsons Solicitors dated 21 November 2003.  
     
      
    23 This latter letter confirmed the stance taken by the Ronens; that is, that the retainer given to Mr Geller and the firm to act on behalf of the Ronens and certain companies gave rise to contractual as well as fiduciary obligations which were not limited to but extended at least to an obligation of confidentiality; and that the Ronens had confirmed to Mr Geller and his partner that in the absence of express permission from the Ronens, which had not been given, the obligations of confidentiality and privilege continued to bind Mr Geller and the firm not to disclose to any third party any matter whatsoever pertaining to any of them or the companies. There are other matters raised in the letter which I need not mention at this point.  
     
      
    24 The summary position is that Mr Geller, it would seem, is not entirely unwilling to confer with the Crown but does not wish to run the risk of the threatened proceedings arising out of the existence of the alleged obligation of confidentiality arising out of the relationship between himself and the Ronens and certain companies.  
     
      
    25 Confidentiality clauses and agreements of this kind of course have been held to be unenforceable where they have been sought to be used to obstruct the administration of the criminal law. This is because to do so would be contrary to public policy (see Hayden & Ors (1984) 156 CLR 532 at 545, 553, 574, 586).  
     
      
    26 The third possible witness is Mr Geller's partner, Graham Hurwitz. His situation appears to be identical to that of Mr Geller although he has not provided a statement to the ACC or to the prosecution.  
     
      
    27 The materiality of the relevant witnesses, as appears from my brief summary of their respective positions, is this: Miss Lawler is a person who supplied the documentation as to deposited cash amounts; and Mr Geller apparently is the partner in the accountants' office who prepared the consequent tax returns. Each, it is said, did so on the instructions of the defendants, and these records, that is the deposit records and the tax returns, according to the Crown case are false records in relation to the actual income generated by the four retail outlets. In that regard, the records and also the witnesses are highly relevant, from the Crown perspective, to matters pertaining to the commission of the alleged offences.  
     
      
    28 In the circumstances I have outlined, the Crown has asked, now that the accused have been arraigned and pleaded not guilty, that a preliminary hearing be held for the purpose of enabling the Crown to ask questions of the two material witnesses, Miss Lawler and Mr Geller. One purpose of the preliminary hearing is to enable the Crown, and for that matter the defence, to know precisely what it is that each of the two witnesses would say in further amplification of the brief statements they have provided some considerable time ago.  
     
      
    29 The proposal is vehemently opposed by counsel for the accused. The main thrust of the defence argument has been advanced by Mr Rickter of Queen's Counsel, who appears for Mrs Ida Ronen. His submissions have been endorsed by Mr Hill of Queen's Counsel, who appears for Nitzan Ronen, and Mr van de Wiel QC, who appears for Izhar Ronen.  
     
      
    30 Mr Rickter has put his arguments in a number of ways. Firstly, he has argued that the real purpose of this application is to transform the Court into an instrument of gathering evidence for the prosecution. Categorised in that way the proposal is, so it is argued, ""out of bounds and unwarranted"".  
     
      
    31 Secondly, Mr Rickter has argued that there is no similarity between this proposal and that which commonly occurs in what is generally described as a Basha inquiry. In those well known circumstances, the defence is confronted with a statement from a witness in circumstances where it has not had the opportunity of examining his or her evidence at committal; and upon application by the defence is then permitted to remove the unfairness or prejudice caused by the absence of the witness at the committal.  
     
      
    32 Thirdly, Mr Rickter has pointed to the fact that in the case of Miss Lawler, as is shown by the correspondence, she had asked the Crown to fax her a list of questions that the Crown wished to ask. This was done at the same time she indicated that she intended to decline to attend a conference with the Crown.  
     
      
    33 In the case of Mr Geller it seems that there were discussions between counsel towards the end of last year when it was indicated to the Crown that they might, if they wished, supply details in writing of exactly what matters the prosecution wished to speak about with Mr Geller.  
     
      
    34 These proposals, Mr Rickter said, emanating from both Miss Lawler and the defence, had not been availed of by the Crown and, according to this aspect of his argument, this history lends considerable support to the proposition that the present application is both misconceived and unnecessary. In response to arguments advanced by the Crown, Mr Rickter accepted that both Miss Lawler and Mr Geller could be and no doubt would be called as witnesses at trial. There was, he argued forcefully, no warrant however for taking their evidence in a preliminary hearing at this stage. He suggested that the Crown's fears that the trial might miscarry in midstream unless the Crown's suggested procedures were adopted at this stage were in truth unlikely to materialise. Essentially, however, Mr Rickter repeated in additional submissions that the suggested procedures at this stage were not warranted or for that matter permissible.  
     
      
    35 It will be apparent that it has been necessary for me to come to a decision promptly in relation to this preliminary matter. I have endeavoured to give careful consideration to each of the competing arguments. I have come to the conclusion, after considering the matter, that I should make an order in the terms requested by the Crown. I shall state my reasons briefly.  
     
      
    36 The starting point is the general recognition of the Court's power, long-acknowledged, to regulate and control criminal proceedings, including the power to control and regulate the manner in which evidence is presented or elicited (Mooney v James 1969 VLR 22 at 28). Secondly, there are the provisions of the New South Wales Evidence Act 1995 (see especially s 11(1), s 26, s 29(1)). Thirdly, there is the fundamental obligation cast on the Court to ensure that a fair trial is held. It is in this context that procedures such as the Basha inquiry have evolved. The preliminary taking of evidence from a witness not called at the committal is however but one instance of the general proposition recognised in R v Basha, which is reported at (1989) 39 ACrimR 337. The general proposition, as I have described it, was expressed succinctly by Finlay J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Carruthers J agreed, in Palmer, an unreported decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal delivered on 4 September 1992. In that case at page 19 his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        ""The hearing of voir dire examinations by a Judge in the absence of the jury is usually to settle a question raised by either party concerning any fact which has to be assumed for the purpose of the trial proper; for example, the hostility, expertise or competence of witnesses, or the voluntariness of confessions. However, on occasion judges, as a matter of discretion, have allowed such an examination by way of voir dire when they have thought the interests of justice were best met by so doing.” 
        
       
      
    37 In my view, in the unusual circumstances revealed in the present matter, it is in the interests of justice that the procedure suggested by the Crown be adopted. Of course, I have taken into account Mr Rickter's forceful caveats but I do not accept that the ordering of the pre-trial evidence envisaged in the present application embroils or is likely to embroil the Court in becoming a coercive instrument involved in the Crown's investigatory tasks. On the contrary, I believe that the suggested procedure, in the unusual circumstances here, will lead to the more efficient and orderly running of the trial and will indicate precisely to the defence (if they do not already know it) the precise nature of the evidence they will have to meet. Moreover, it will provide this information well before trial and will reduce, or at least tend to reduce, the danger of an aborted trial. 
     
      
    38 This trial, it must be said, has all the hallmarks of a complex trial. It is likely to be lengthy and will plainly involve considerable time and expense. The prospect of a discharge of jury mid-stream is, in my view, by no means fanciful or unrealistic and the suggested procedure will have the capacity to reduce the risk of that occurring. Nor do I consider that the Court is bound to act by holding a preliminary inquiry only where it is the defence which seeks the hearing. There are many instances that can be envisaged where a duty will fall on a prosecutor to make such an application, even where an application had not been made by the defence. 
     
      
    39 There are four other matters that I wish to mention, albeit briefly. First, it is conceded by the defence that both Miss Lawler and Mr Geller may be called as witnesses at trial. There is no doubt that there are possible aspects of their evidence that, in the ordinary course, might well have to be explored during the preliminary hearing at trial in the absence of the jury. For example, whether either witness has any objection to answering questions put by the Crown and, if so, the nature and validity of those objections. In a theoretical sense, it may be possible that either witness may have an objection on the basis of self-incrimination. From the point of view of the Crown, it may be necessary to ascertain whether, for example, Miss Lawler is an unfavourable witness or unreliable in some respect. Moreover, because of the complex nature of the trial, particularly in relation to documentary material, it is possible that questioning may lead the witness to require, quite fairly, an opportunity to examine documents and reflect upon them before answering questions. Considerations of this kind lend support, in my view, to the proposition that the questioning should take place at this stage well in advance of the trial. 
     
      
    40 The second matter is that each of these two witnesses has a continuing and close business connection with the accused. This is one of the aspects that makes this an unusual circumstance in the present matter. Moreover, at least in the case of Mr Geller, it appears that his reluctance to confer with the Crown arises precisely because of the arrangements between his firm and the defendants. Perhaps it might be more accurate to say that his reluctance to confer with the Crown has arisen because of the threat of proceedings being instituted against him if he breaches confidentiality. This is an added feature that makes the present situation very unusual. 
     
      
    41 Although the position of Miss Lawler has not been made clear by any direct evidence, it seems to me to be a fair inference to draw from all the evidence that has been placed before me that this is not simply a situation where a citizen with no connection with either the Crown or any of the accused is simply unwilling to assist the prosecution. Of course, I am unable to draw any greater inference than that in all the circumstances and I do not do so. 
     
      
    42 The third matter is that it is plain that no specific prejudice will flow to any of the accused if the order sought is made. Mr Rickter quite fairly and candidly admitted that this was so. 
     
      
    43 The final matter is that the circumstances demonstrate that the Crown simply does not know the details or the ambit of the evidence that either of these two obviously material witnesses will give at the trial. This is essentially because each of the witnesses has, for their own reasons, declined to confer with the Crown. While it is true that the witnesses might be given a list of questions by the Crown, that, in my view, is no answer to the problems I foresee at trial. 
     
      
    44 The position of the Court must be that it is not in the ultimate concerned with perceived forensic advantages and disadvantages advocated by the competing parties in the trial. The Court's task is to ensure that a fair trial is held and the defence knows exactly the case it has to meet. Moreover, the Court has a power in appropriate circumstances to allow a preliminary hearing by way of voir dire when it is perceived that the interests of justice will be best met by adopting that course. For all the reasons I have given, I am satisfied that that is the case here. 
     
      
    45 I order that a preliminary hearing be held prior to the commencement of trial for the taking of evidence of witnesses Jennifer Lawler and Ian Geller. 
     
      
    46 I grant leave to the Crown to issue a subpoena directed to Miss Jennifer Lawler at 146 Victoria Street, Beaconsfield, New South Wales, such a subpoena requiring her attendance at this Court at 2pm tomorrow, 4 February 2004. I direct short service of the subpoena. Service is to be effected at the place of work of Miss Lawler prior to 5pm today. 
     
      
    47 In relation to Mr Geller, I grant leave to issue a subpoena returnable to Mr Ian Geller requiring his attendance at 10am on 5 February 2004 and I direct short service of the subpoena, service to be effected by 5pm at Mr Geller's place of work today, on 3 February 2004.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
      
     1  
     JAMES J 
     : Robert John McCann has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court by her Honour Judge Gibb on 13 December 2002, after he had been found guilty of four counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of indecent assault. All of the offences had been committed on the same evening, the evening of 9 April 2001. The victim of all four of the offences was a young woman who was 27 years old at the time the offences were committed. I will refer to her simply as ""the victim"" or ""the complainant"". 
      
       
      
     2 The sentence imposed by her Honour was as follows:  
      
      
       
       Count 1, a term of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of four years.  
        
       Count 2, a similar sentence, that is a term of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of four years. 
        
       Count 3, a term of imprisonment of seven years with a non-parole period of four and a half years. 
        
       Count 4 (which was the charge of indecent assault), a fixed term of imprisonment of one year. 
        
       Count 5, a term of imprisonment of eight years with a non-parole period of four years nine months. 
       
      
      
     3 Her Honour made all of the sentences commence from the same date, 13 December 2002, which was the date of sentencing. 
      
      
     4 Sexual intercourse with another person without that person's consent in circumstances of aggravation is an offence under s 61J of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. The circumstances of aggravation relied on by the Crown in all of the four counts under s 61J were that at the time of committing the offences the applicant maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim. Indecent assault is an offence under s 61L of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. 
      
      
     5 In her Honour's remarks on sentence her Honour stated the facts of the offences largely by quoting extensively from the evidence in chief of the complainant at the trial, which, as her Honour remarked, the jury at the trial must have accepted. 
      
      
     6 The victim, an overseas student, started to occupy a bedroom in the applicant's apartment in a Sydney suburb about a month before the offences were committed. She had answered an advertisement by the applicant offering the bedroom for renting.  
      
       
      
     7 On in the evening of 9 April 2001 the applicant returned home late and the applicant and the victim spent some time watching television. The applicant asked the victim whether she would take her clothes off. The victim refused. The applicant then said that, if the victim took her clothes off, she would not have to pay rent for the next week. The victim again refused. The applicant then said to the victim that, if the victim did not take her clothes off, she would have to move out of the premises. The victim asked if she could move out the following day but the applicant said she would have to move out that night. The victim went to her bedroom and started to pack her belongings. The applicant followed her to the bedroom. He again demanded that she take her clothes off and said that, if she did not do so, he would rape her. The applicant closed a window in the bedroom, which the victim had attempted to open. He punched the victim a number of times and forced her on to the bed. The victim's evidence continued. 
      
       
        
         
          
         “We were struggling and then he managed to grab my pants and pull it down so he pulled it off me, so I didn’t have anything on. And then he came on top of me and then he spread my legs open and he started licking my vagina. And then he put his finger in, he stuck his finger in and then after that he moved his underpants to the side and he pushed himself in several times. And then he got off me and he laid on the bed on his back with his legs open, wide open, and he had one leg to the door, and he said, ‘Suck my cock” and I did that.”  
          
          
         “..and I asked him several times if I can stop, I said, “Can I stop” and he said, “No” and then finally I asked him, “Can I stop” and he said, “Yes.”” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “And I did that and then I said “Can I stop now?” and he said “No” and then several times and then he said “Take your top off” and I did, I took my top off, and then he grabbed me by the waist and then he started licking and sucking my left breast and then he pushed me onto the bed and then he spread my legs open and they were – they were up in the air and then he came on top of me and he was pushing me – he was pushing me roughly, pushing inside then he finally stopped.” 
          
          
         “He had his penis inside so he was pushing me.”  
         
        
       
      
     8 The victim ultimately escaped from the premises and went to the nearby house of persons she knew and made a complaint of having been sexually assaulted by the applicant. The victim was driven to a hospital, where she was medically examined. The doctor who conducted the examination gave evidence at the trial that the victim had bruising and swelling to her legs, arms and hands and that there was dried blood around her nose. The victim gave evidence at the trial that these injuries had been caused in the assault by the applicant upon her. 
      
      
     9 Count 1 in the indictment was based on the applicant's conduct in licking the victim's vagina. Count 2 was based on the applicant's digital penetration of the victim's vagina. Count 3 was based on the act of fellatio which the applicant compelled the victim to perform. Count 4 was based on the applicant's conduct in licking and sucking the victim's breast and Count 5 was based on the act of penile penetration of the victim's vagina. 
      
      
     10 The applicant's case at the trial, which the jury rejected, was that all sexual activity between the applicant and the victim had been consensual and that it had been the victim who had become violent after the sexual activity had ended. 
      
      
     11 In sentencing the applicant her Honour delivered fairly lengthy remarks on sentence. Her Honour listed the offences, quoted extensively from the evidence the victim had given at the trial, related the various counts to the victim's evidence and noted the version of events the applicant had given at the trial and in a statement made on 4 December 2002, shortly before he was sentenced. 
      
      
     12 In her remarks on sentence her Honour referred to the victim as having been in a ""vulnerable position on the night of 9 April 2001 by reason of where she was, the time of night and the sheer physical size of the offender.” Her Honour said the victim was physically slight, whereas ""the offender is 5 foot 11 and a half inches tall on his own estimation and appears to be an extremely large man, perhaps four times the weight of the victim, with a very imposing girth as well as appearing very tall.” 
      
      
     13 Her Honour referred to the impact of the offences on the victim, quoting from a report by a clinical psychologist who had counselled the victim. The psychologist's report said the victim ""had displayed many symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder such as withdrawal, poor sleep, fear, anxiety, feelings of helplessness, over-sensitivity and some disbelief that it could have happened to her"" but that her condition had improved emotionally and socially. 
      
       
      
     14 The subjective circumstances of the applicant were summarised in counse 
     l  
     for the applicant's written submissions as follows. 
      
       
        
         
          
         “The applicant was born on 16 May 1964. He was 36 years old at the time of the offences and 38 when sentenced. 
         
        
        
         
         He has a history of criminal convictions commencing in 1980. He has previously been sentenced to imprisonment. There are no sexual offences.  
         
        
        
         
         He was brought up in an environment in which he was exposed to paternal alcohol abuse and violence. He, in turn, developed problems with alcohol abuse. Despite this he generally managed to consistently maintain full-time employment. A long-term relationship terminated in 1997 and he began drinking excessively. At the time he stood for sentence he had settled into a new relationship that a probation officer described as “stable and supportive,” had curbed his alcohol intake and had attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Psychological testing indicated a “substantial life-time risk of alcohol dependence.” He was assessed as having a “medium-low” risk of re-offending in relation to sexual offences. He was described as ‘a much over-weight person’ and he suffers from sleep apnoea.”  
         
        
       
      
      
     15 Her Honour referred in her remarks on sentence to parts of a report by a psychologist Dr Lennings. In his report Dr Lennings stated that  
      
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr McCann is a much overweight person. He suffers from sleep apnoea. He tells me that his weight gain is recent and may relate to his unhappiness in the situation he finds himself in.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     16 On the basis of the applicant having held regular employment and having a stable relationship, her Honour found that the applicant had some prospects of rehabilitation. Her Honour found that no penalty other than imprisonment would be appropriate (see  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      s 5). In reaching this conclusion her Honour said,  
      
      
       
        
         
         ""I am conscious that Mr McCann's physical size and his sleep apnoea, as well as what his fiance describes as snoring that is loud enough, ""to wake the dead"" are factors that will make any time spent in custody somewhat more difficult than it would be otherwise. Nonetheless, the only appropriate sentence for each of the five offences is a sentence of full-time custody.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     17 Her Honour found special circumstances within section 44(2) of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      by reason of the applicant's longstanding problems of alcohol abuse and his physical health. 
      
       
      
     18 Her Honour decided to make all of the five sentences concurrent, ""given that the offences formed part of a continumum."" 
      
       
      
     19 Three specific grounds of appeal were relied upon by the applicant. It is convenient to deal with the second and third grounds before dealing with the first ground. 
      
       
        
         
        
       Ground 2 The sentencing judge erred by increasing the sentences for counts 4 and 5 by 1 and 2 years respectively solely because the complainant repeated her request that the applicant desist. 
        
        
       The reference to count 4 in the statement of the ground should be a reference to count 3.  
       
      
      
     20 This ground of appeal is based on passages at pages 12 and 13 of her Honour's remarks on sentence, where her Honour was pronouncing her formal sentencing orders. In dealing with the third count her Honour said,  
      
       
        
         
          
         ""This offence occurred and continued after the victim had again asked Mr McCann to desist. This offence warrants a longer sentence.""  
         
        
       
      
      
     21 The sentence for the offence charged in the third count was one year longer than the sentences for each of the offences charged in counts 1 and 2.  
      
       
      
     22 In dealing with the fifth count her Honour said, ""Again this offence followed another attempt by the victim to persuade the offender to desist."" The sentence for the offence charged in the fifth count was one year longer than the sentence for the sentence charged in the third count and two years longer than the sentences for the offences charged in the first and second counts. 
      
       
      
     23 It was submitted that the sentencing judge had increased the sentences for the offences charged in counts 3 and 5 solely because these offences had been committed after the victim had again demonstrated her lack of consent to sexual activity and had again attempted to persuade the applicant to desist and that these increments were manifestly excessive. It was submitted that the circumstances that the victim continued to convey her lack of consent and continued to attempt to persuade the applicant to desist did not warrant any additional punishment or, if they did warrant any additional punishment, the increments in the sentences imposed by her Honour were manifestly excessive.  
      
       
      
     24 In my opinion, this ground of appeal should be rejected. I consider that it was open to her Honour to regard the criminality in the commission of the offences charged in the third and fifth counts as being aggravated by the circumstances referred to by her Honour and that the increased penalties imposed by her Honour were within the range of her Honour's sentencing discretion. 
      
       
        
         
        
       Ground 3 No, or insufficient, weight was given to the finding of the sentencing judge that custodial conditions for the applicant will be harsher than would otherwise be endured. 
        
       
      
     25 I have already quoted the part of her Honour's remarks on sentence in which her Honour referred to the applicant's physical size, sleep apnoea and snoring. It was submitted that her Honour had improperly limited the relevance of these matters in the sentencing of the applicant. Her Honour had referred to the applicant's physical size, sleep apnoea and his snoring, only in considering whether she was satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate and had not referred to these matters in determining the length of the sentences of imprisonment she should impose. 
      
      
     26 It is clear that any medical condition to which a person being sentenced is subject, which would have the effect of making imprisonment more than usually onerous for him, is relevant, not only in determining whether no penalty other than imprisonment would be appropriate but also, if such a determination is made, in determining what should be the length of the sentence of imprisonment to be imposed. However, I would not accept that the sentencing judge, having referred in her consideration of section 5 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      to the applicant's physical size, sleep apnoea and snoring as being factors that would make any time spent in prison more difficult than it would be otherwise, ignored those matters when she proceeded to determine the length of the sentences she should impose. I would reject the third ground of appeal. 
      
       
      
     27 I turn now to Ground 1. 
      
       
        
         
        
       The sentences for the four counts of aggravated sexual assault involve multiple punishment for the common element of infliction of bodily harm. 
        
       
      
     28 As already noted, four of the five counts for which the applicant was sentenced charged offences under s 61J of the Crimes Act and in the case of every one of these counts the circumstances of aggravation were that at the time of the commission of the offence the applicant had maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, in the case of each count, the conduct of the applicant relied on as constituting the malicious inflicting of actual bodily harm was the same and that the applicant should not have been punished more than once for the same conduct but that it could be inferred, from the sentences imposed and from her Honour's remarks on sentence, that her Honour had taken the same conduct into account in determining what sentence she should impose for every one of the offences of aggravated sexual assault. 
      
      
     29 Counsel for the applicant referred to the decision of the High Court in  
     Pearce v The Queen 
      (1998) 194 CLR 610. In  
     Pearce 
      the indictment included inter alia two counts, inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm, an offence under section 33 of the Crimes Act (Count 9) and breaking and entering a dwelling house and while therein inflicting grievous bodily harm, an offence under section 110 of the Crimes Act (Count 10). 
      
       
      
     30 Pearce applied for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the indictment was oppressive or an abuse of process, on the grounds that by the inclusion of counts 9 and 10 in the indictment he would be placed in double jeopardy. The application for a stay was refused. Pearce then pleaded guilty to several counts in the indictment including counts 9 and 10. The sentences passed on Pearce included sentences for the offences charged in counts 9 and 10, for each of which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years (less time already served), the two sentences to be served fully concurrently but cumulatively on a sentence for another offence. 
      
      
     31 Counsel for the applicant referred to parts of the joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in  
     Pearce 
      as follows. 
      
      
       
        
         
         “(40) To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap.  
         
        
        
         
         (42) It is clear in this case that a single act (the appellant’s inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim) was an element of each of the offences under ss 33 and 110. The identification of a single act as common to two offences may not always be as straightforward. It should, however, be emphasised that the inquiry is not to be attended by “excessive subtleties and refinements.” It should be approached as a matter of common sense, not as a matter of semantics. 
         
        
        
         
         (43) The trial judge sentenced the appellant to identical terms of imprisonment on counts 9 and 10 and made those sentences wholly concurrent. We can only conclude that the sentence on each of those counts contained a portion which was to punish the appellant for his inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim. Prima facie, then, he was doubly punished for the one act.” 
         
        
       
      
     32 In their joint judgment their Honours then considered whether Pearce should be regarded as having been doubly punished for the same act, even though the sentencing judge had ordered that the two sentences on counts 9 and 10 be served fully concurrently. Their Honours held that the sentencing judge should have fixed an appropriate sentence for each of the offences before considering questions of accumulation or concurrence and totality and that the individual sentences imposed on counts 9 and 10 were flawed because they doubly punished the applicant for a single act, namely, the inflicting of grievous bodily harm, even though the two sentences were to be served fully concurrently. 
      
       
      
     33 Their Honours further held that for the sentencing judge to have made the two sentences wholly concurrent was erroneous, in that the sentencing judge had failed to take account of the differences in the conduct which was the subject of punishment in each count. The High Court remitted the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with consistently with the reasons for judgment of the High Court. 
      
      
     34 In a further hearing in the Court of Criminal Appeal, (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 18 December 1998) the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the sentence for count 10 and substituted a fixed term of imprisonment of two years, to be served concurrently with the other sentences, but confirmed the sentence for count 9, because the Court was not satisfied, in accordance with s 6(3) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     , that some other less severe sentence was warranted and should have been passed. 
      
       
      
     35 In the present case it was submitted that the error which it was contended had occurred had infected three of the four sentences for aggravated sexual assault and that in the case of all four offences lesser sentences should have been passed. 
      
       
      
     36 During the course of argument on this application the Court informed counsel that it appeared to the Court that the first ground of appeal raised a difficult issue of principle on the application of  
     Pearce 
     , being an issue which it was not really appropriate for a bench of the Court consisting of only two judges to endeavour to resolve. The Court indicated to counsel that, even if the Court was minded to allow the first ground of appeal and to enter upon a consideration of what sentences should be imposed on the applicant, the Court would consider that the sentences which should properly be imposed on the applicant in any re-sentencing of the applicant would not be less severe in their effect than the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge. I have earlier in my judgment referred to the objective facts of the offences and the subjective features of the applicant. 
      
       
      
     37 In the light of this indication of the view the Court had taken, both counsel for the applicant and counsel for the Crown informed the Court that it was not necessary for this Court, constituted as it is, to endeavour to resolve the question of principle which is raised by the first ground of appeal. 
      
       
      
     38 In the circumstances I would simply propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal against sentence be dismissed.

     THURSDAY 5 FEBRUARY 2004 
      
     
     
     REGINA v THOMAS JAMES EUSTICE 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 ADAMS J: The Crown appeals from sentences imposed on 8 August 2003 in the District Court on the respondent in respect of one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm under s59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act) and one count of common assault. 
     
      
    2 The circumstances giving rise to the charges are not in dispute and are as follows: At about 1.30am on 3 March 2002 James Valks, aged 16, Maximillian Kensell, aged 16, and Kristina Hoffman, aged 14, were walking along Clanalpine Street, Mosman when Valks was approached by one Benjamin Daly, aged 18, who knew him. Daly demanded a cigarette from Valks. The respondent, then aged 18, who was known only to Kensell, also approached Valks. Five other unidentified males joined Daly and the respondent. One of these men punched Valks causing him to fall to the ground where he was continually punched and kicked to his upper body. One of the unidentified males then took Valks’ backpack which contained clothing and personal items. A silver necklace, bracelet and ring were also removed from his person. Valks managed to get to his feet but when he tried to flee was caught and dragged to the ground where he was kicked and punched by the group of males which included the respondent and Daly. 
     
      
    3 The respondent then chased Kensell, who was standing about 30 metres away, caught him and threw him to the ground causing him to strike his head. The respondent ran away from Kensell, passed Valks, who by then had got to his feet, pushed him over and joined Daly and the other men and left the area. 
     
      
    4 Valks was taken to hospital where he was treated for multiple superficial abrasions to the back of his head, upper back and elbows, welts to the upper area of both arms, a superficial abrasion above his right eyebrow, bruising below his right eye, marked swelling to his right cheek, and a small abrasion to his left cheek. 
     
      
    5 It is important to note not all these injuries were inflicted by the respondent. On the other hand, he was charged with and convicted of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm under s59(2) of the Act which includes in effect, as a circumstance of aggravation, the fact that he was in company at the time of the assault. 
     
      
    6 The respondent, who was arrested on 10 May 2002, denied any involvement in the offence when interviewed by police. He was committed for trial on 21 January 2003.  
     
      
    7 Daly pleaded guilty to one count of assaulting Valks on 14 March 2003. Amongst other things he indicated a preparedness to give evidence against the respondent. Daly also pleaded to an unrelated charge of larceny, being the theft of money and a mobile telephone at a hotel, which occurred a few hours after the assault in question. The learned Magistrate rightly gave both the early plea and the offer of assistance to the authorities considerable weight and sentenced Daly to 100 hours of community service. 
     
      
    8 The respondent’s trial was first mentioned in the District Court on 31 January 2003 and fixed for hearing on 14 April 2003. At this stage the indictment contained four counts, two of aggravated robbery, and one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (under s59(2) of the Act), both of these in respect of Valks, all being in the alternative, and the fourth, common assault of Kensell. On 11 April 2003 the respondent pleaded guilty to the alternative count under s59(2) and the last count.  
     
      
    9 There was some preceding correspondence which was produced before us between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the respondent’s solicitors. Although I do not regard this material as being anything more than adding to the chronology, in particular as disclosing anything adverse to the respondent, objection is taken to it by Mr Hulme SC for the respondent, on the basis it was not material tendered before the learned sentencing judge. This objection is well taken and, accordingly, I disregard the correspondence.  
     
      
    10 After several adjournments the sentence hearing occurred on 8 August 2003. It was brief. The agreed facts, virtually the same as set out above, were tendered together with a pre-sentence report. The respondent did not give evidence. 
     
      
    11 The learned sentencing judge noted that the offender was supported in court by his step-father (who had married his mother in March 2003) and with whom he had developed a close and supportive relationship. The respondent’s family life had been difficult and disruptive, though he appears to have done reasonably well at school. He had been in casual employment whilst at school and had several jobs thereafter. He was employed at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    12 On 19 February 2002 the Local Court, as I read the record, had found the respondent had committed a common assault but without proceeding to conviction placed him on a six month bond to be of good behaviour. Even so, his headmaster had said that the respondent was not prone to violence. The fact that at the time of the present offence the respondent had not only committed only a short time before another offence of violence and that he was then on a bond to be of good behaviour was, to my mind, a most significant consideration for sentencing him. It was not, however, adverted to by the learned sentencing judge. 
     
      
    13 The Probation and Parole Officer’s report concluded as follows –  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Eustice impresses as a personable young man whose involvement in these proceedings has had a salutary impact on him. As a result he has disassociated himself from former associates and re-assessed his goals. He is aware that his frequent moves and difficult family circumstances throughout his formative years have had an impact upon his ability to form close friendships. 
        
       
       
        
        Inquiries indicate that the offender has a positive network of support in the community which includes his mother and stepfather and former school principal. He appears to have the personal resources to seek assistance should he require it.” 
        
       
      
    14 The District Court imposed a sentence of 100 hours of community service upon the respondent. The learned sentencing judge, in brief but adequate reasons, pointed to the plea of guilty as an indicator of contrition (which I think could have been justified on stronger grounds) and justifying an allowance for its utilitarian worth. However, as I have already observed, the plea of guilty was only entered a few days before the date set for the hearing of the trial. 
     
      
    15 His Honour noted that the offender had no record (in one sense this may have been true, in that he had no conviction) and was “comparatively young”. This last consideration is undoubtedly a most material one. His Honour rightly gave weight to the fact that the respondent was in employment and had the support of his mother and step-father and concluded –  
     
      
       
        
        “I am of the view reasonably that in all probability the respondent would not re-offend.” 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour gave some significance, though its extent is uncertain, to the sentence passed in the Local Court on Daly but omitted to mention the fact that Daly had agreed to give evidence for the prosecution at the offender’s trial. As I have mentioned, had it not been for this factor I do not doubt the principle concerning parity between co-offenders would have been an important consideration in sentencing this respondent. See R v Lowe (1984) 154 CLR 606; Postiglone v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. 
     
      
    17 However, the agreement to give evidence was a very substantial point of differentiation and, together with the very early plea entered by Daly, to my mind greatly reduced the significance of Daly’s sentence as a material factor in measuring the respondent’s sentence. Although it is true that the prosecutor did not bring Daly’s offer to the sentencing judge’s attention, his Honour had the magistrate’s reasons for sentence before him. 
     
      
    18 At the same time, it should be noted that his solicitors submitted to the learned sentencing judge that the respondent offered to assist the authorities (I assume in respect of the other unidentified males) but they decided “just not to pursue the matter further”. This was a relevant element in the sentencing process and Senior Counsel appearing for the Crown in this Court has confirmed that such an offer was indeed made.  
     
      
    19 It seems to me that the learned sentencing judge, with respect, gave far too much significance to the issue of parity with Daly, for the reasons which I have mentioned. Furthermore, the objective gravity of the crime indicated that the respondent had committed a serious offence. The cowardly attack on these three young people in a public street was not only an attack upon them but upon the right of members of the community to use the public thoroughfares without fear. The respondent, though young, was not a child. 
     
      
    20 Having regard, therefore, to the sentence imposed and to the errors which I have identified, it seems to me that this Court should conclude that the sentence imposed in the District Court was indeed manifestly lenient and that this Court needs to re-consider it. 
     
      
    21 Having already described the facts of the case and the personal circumstances of the respondent, I do not propose to do it again for the purpose of considering what sentence this Court ought to impose. I note, though, it has no material impact, for the sake of correctness, that his Honour sentenced the respondent globally for two charges and, in accordance with R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610, ought not to have done so. 
     
      
    22 An affidavit has been tendered by the respondent in these proceedings which indicates his present personal circumstances, including the fact that he had recently lost his employment and is seeking further employment. I consider that his prospects of employment are good and that this Court should proceed upon the basis that his Honour’s assessment that the respondent would be unlikely to offend again was a correct one. 
     
      
    23 Having regard to all the circumstances in the case, I am satisfied that it is not appropriate for this Court to sentence the respondent to a custodial term of imprisonment. To my mind the work which he must undertake pursuant to a community service order is not only more useful from the community’s point of view but I think it is more useful for him and, as I have already mentioned, his relative youth is a significant factor, not only in his interest but in the public interest, to be borne in mind and accounted for. 
     
      
    24 Furthermore, this Court has always, because of the principle of double jeopardy, held its hand in relation to the severity of sentences which might otherwise have been appropriate had they been imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    25 Taking into account all the circumstances, I consider that the appeal should be allowed, the sentence below quashed, that on the first count, namely, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the respondent should be ordered to perform community service of 150 hours and that in addition, in relation to the second count, he should be subject to an order for community service for an additional 100 hours. Because he has already undertaken, as I read the papers, two days community service, I propose that the commencement of those orders should be 3 February 2004. 
     
      
    26 HULME J: The facts in this matter are recounted by Adams J and accordingly I can be brief. The sentencing proceedings in the District Court miscarried. They miscarried in a number of ways. Firstly, although as his Honour was correct to say the principle of parity should be applied by him, he was in error in not recognising that the sentence which had been imposed on a co-offender had been influenced by the co-offender’s willingness to assist the authorities to an extent which had no application in the case of the respondent here. 
     
      
    27 Secondly, the proceedings miscarried because his Honour regarded the respondent as having no record. That proposition is misleading unless one also recognises that the respondent had been placed on a bond for a somewhat similar offence as recently as a few weeks before the subject offences. 
     
      
    28 The sentencing judge also said that the plea of guilty indicated contrition. That proposition also was erroneous. As Dixon CJ said in Holloway v McFeeters (1956) 94 CLR 470 at 477 –  
     
      
       
        
        “(An) inference may be made only as the most probable deduction from the established facts”. 
        
       
      
    29 Here there had been some plea bargaining between the respondent, or those representing him, and the Crown. His plea of guilty to two of the four charges presented, and the Crown’s acceptance of those pleas in full satisfaction of the indictment, make his plea equally explicable upon the basis he was making the best of a bad situation. 
     
      
    30 That said, there was before his Honour other evidence of contrition, particularly that contained in a Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report and, although I think his Honour erred in the way he reached the conclusion of a finding of contrition, I do not think the ultimate finding was wrong. 
     
      
    31 Thirdly, the sentence was manifestly inadequate having regard to the respondent’s offending and particularly when that offending was in the face of a bond into which he had entered but recently.  
     
      
    32 In all of the circumstances, this Court should interfere, notwithstanding the residual discretion it has not to do so, even if it finds error in the Court below. A sentence which involved a custodial element would have been justified. However, the practice of this Court, when it increases a sentence imposed below, is to impose the minimum which might properly have been imposed at first instance.  
     
      
    33 In these circumstances I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J. 
     
      
    34 GILES JA: I agree with the orders and with both reasons which have been given. Accordingly, the formal order of the Court will be: Appeal allowed, the sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed. In lieu thereof, on the count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the respondent is ordered to perform community service for 150 hours commencing on 3 February 2004 and, on the count of assault, the respondent is ordered to perform community service for a further 100 hours. The order also commences on 3 February 2004 but with the community service cumulative upon the preceding 150 hours.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
      
     1  
     JAMES J: 
      Kimberley Wayne Middlebrook has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on the 29 August 2003 by her Honour Judge English, after he had pleaded guilty to one charge under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996. Section 51D was inserted in the Firearms Act by the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2002 No 47 which commenced on the 15 July 2002. Section 51D(2) provides:  
      
       
        
         
          
         “A person who is in possession of more than three firearms, any one of which is a prohibited firearm...is guilty of an offence under this subsection if: 
          
           
           (a) the firearm is not registered; and 
            
           (b) the person is not authorised by a licence or permit to possess firearms. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 20 years."" 
         
        
       
      
      
     2 In sentencing the applicant her Honour took into account seven further offences which I will refer to more fully later in this judgment. For the offence under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act and taking into account the further seven offences, her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years commencing on the 29 August 2003, the date of sentencing, with a non-parole period of three years. 
      
       
      
     3 The applicant had been arrested and charged on the 18 February 2003 but had immediately been granted bail and he had remained at liberty on bail until he was sentenced.  
      
      
     4 Her Honour's statement of the facts of the offence was derived from a statement of facts prepared in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which was admitted into evidence without objection in the proceedings on sentence. In her remarks on sentence her Honour said: 
      
      
       
        
         
         “… on 13 February 2003, after receiving information that the offender had cannabis plants and unregistered firearms at his premises, police sought and obtained a search warrant. At 3.40 pm on 14 February 2003 six officers from the Manning Great Lakes Area Command drove to the offender’s premises and executed the search warrant. The offender resides at 190 Winmurra Drive Possum Brush. The property is a rural block approximately 37 hectares in area. A cabin and a large open work shed stand on the property about 200 metres back from Winmurra Drive at the end of a dirt driveway. The work shed is about 40 metres east of the cabin and a caravan was parked about ten metres east of the work shed. No one was present when the police arrived at the property. A search was conducted and five cannabis plants were located on the eastern side of the caravan. The plants were growing in containers and measured .5 of metre to 1.5 in heights, and the plants were seized.  
         
        
        
         
         Police then drove around the property looking for more cannabis plants. Two hundred metres along the dirt track police located another four cannabis plants growing in pots near a dam located on the property. These plants measured one to two metres in height and they were also seized. Police returned to the cabin and entered it through the front door which was unlocked. Police immediately saw four firearms mounted horizontally on the wall. The firearm at the top was a Bentley pump action 12 gauge shotgun, the weapon was loaded with three shotgun shells. The second firearm from the top was a Greener’s single shot 12 gauge shotgun, this weapon had a shot sitting in the breech. There were no rounds in the breech. The third weapon from the top was a Sterling .22 calibre bolt action rifle with telescopic scope and magazine. The last firearm on the rack was a Slazenger .22 calibre bolt action single shot rifle. There was no round in its breech. A PVC canon, known as a Spud canon was leaning against the wall. Two ammunition belts were hanging on the wall. One belt contained eight .222 calibre rounds, the second belt contained also .222 calibre rounds. A loaded SKK assault rifle magazine was found on a shelf above the firearms rack. A silver foil containing 3 grams of cannabis seeds was located in a drawer in the bar area. The four firearms, the ammunition belts, the SKK magazine and the PVC canon were seized by police. So too were the drugs.”  
         
        
       
      
     5 On 18 February 2002 the applicant voluntarily attended the Forster Police Station, exercised his right to silence and was charged. As I have already stated, he was immediately granted bail.  
      
      
     6 It was the possession of the four firearms mounted on the wall of the cabin which gave rise to the charge under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act. It was not disputed that none of those firearms were registered and that the applicant was not authorised to possess any of them. The Bentley pump action shotgun was a ""prohibited firearm"" within the meaning of that expression in the Act, as falling within schedule 1 of the Act.  
      
       
      
     7 The seven further offences which the sentencing judge took into account in sentencing the applicant were: 
      
       
      
     1. Cultivation of nine cannabis plants. 
      
     2. Possession of three grams of cannabis seeds. 
      
     3. Unauthorised possession of the PVC Spud cannon. 
      
     4. Failure to ensure the safekeeping of the PVC Spud cannon. 
      
     5. Failure to ensure the safekeeping of the firearms, being the Greener shotgun, the Sterling rifle and the Slazenger rifle. 
      
     6. Failure to ensure the safekeeping of the prohibited weapon, being the Bentley pump action shotgun. 
      
     7. Unauthorised possession of ammunition, being the SKS assault rifle ammunition. 
      
       
      
     8 The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence. Her Honour summarised some of this evidence in her remarks on sentence. Her Honour did not expressly say that she accepted this evidence. However, the evidence had not been challenged in cross-examination of the applicant or in the submissions made on behalf of the Crown in the proceedings on sentence and, in the absence of any statement by her Honour that she did not accept the evidence or any apparent reason why she should not accept the evidence, I would infer that her Honour accepted it. Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “The firearms he says he has owned for a number of years. He was unaware that the Bentley shot gun was a prohibited weapon. He knew he was required to be licensed to own firearms, he just did not bother to obtain a licence. He was aware of the police amnesty and the buy back for the purpose of reducing the number of firearms in the community. He handed in the SKK assault rifle, but chose to keep the remainder of the firearms. He says he kept the firearms to destroy wild dogs, foxes and other vermin on his property. He says they were kept with ammunition in the magazines, not in the breeches, so that he did not have to look for ammunition if he needed to use the rifle in the event that dogs or dingoes were harassing his cattle. He denies that he had the guns loaded to protect his cannabis plants. He says that the PVC cannon was given to his son at Christmas, he was concerned about his son having possession of such a object, so he insisted it remain at Rainbow Flat, rather than be taken back to Brisbane when his son returned after the Christmas holidays.”  
         
        
       
      
     9 In his evidence the applicant said that he had had the Bentley pump action shotgun for about 25 years, that he had used it for duck shooting and that he had last fired it about nine or twelve months before, to shoot a brown snake.  
      
      
     10 The applicant gave evidence that he had had the Greener shotgun and the Slazenger rifle since his wife's father had given them to him about eight years before he was sentenced. The applicant gave evidence that he had had the Sterling rifle for about 15 years, after he had exchanged a trailer for it.  
      
      
     11 In assessing the objective gravity of the principal offence her Honour referred in her remarks on sentence to a number of matters. Her Honour noted that in July 2000 laws had been introduced to inhibit the illegal supply of firearms (her Honour would have been referring to the Firearms Amendment (Trafficking) Act 2001 No 24) and that these laws had been amended by the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2002 No 47. Her Honour referred to part of the speech by the Minister for Police on the second reading of the Bill which became the Firearms Amendment (Public Safety) Act in which the Minister (Mr Costa) had said:  
      
       
        
         
         “This will mean that criminals warehousing illegal guns for sale on the black market will be liable for up to 20 years in gaol if the firearm is prohibited.” 
         
        
       
      
     12 Her Honour said in her remarks on sentence that the use of firearms to commit robberies, to injure and murder police and members of the public and to commit other crimes is becoming prevalent. Her Honour immediately added:  
      
       
        
         
          
         “I am not suggesting for one moment that it was the intention of this offender to do any of those things, but to keep these weapons and to keep them in such a way that access was easily gained to his cabin where they were kept, allows anyone wishing to obtain a firearm to commit a serious offence, instant access to a veritable arsenal capable of causing great harm.” 
         
        
       
      
     13 Later in her remarks on sentence her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “However, having regard to the objectively serious nature of the offence committed and the objectively serious nature of the offences contained on the Form One and the intent of the legislation, I find that this is a matter of the utmost gravity and would result in the imposition of a prison sentence. I find that the offender has shown a blatant disregard for the criminal law. The offender had little regard for public safety. The firearms were on display, they were with magazines loaded and they were kept in premises that were unlocked and easily accessible. The police simply walked onto the property and into the buildings. On the owner’s own evidence, his 15 year old son had access to the weapons which were mounted on the wall and ready for use.”  
         
        
       
      
     14 In her remarks on sentence her Honour said that ""as this offence was committed after 1 January 2003, the applicant is to be sentenced under the new regime,"" by which her Honour meant that the applicant was to be sentenced under legislation which included Div 1A of Pt 4 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      dealing with standard non-parole periods. In fact Div 1A of Pt 4 applies only to offences committed after the 1 February 2003, but as the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced was committed on the 13 February 2003, Div 1A of Pt 4 would have been part of the legislation in force.  
      
      
     15 Her Honour acknowledged that an offence under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act was not included in the offences for which a standard non-parole period had been set. However, her Honour noted that a standard non-parole period had been set for an offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act. Under s 7 of the Firearms Act it is an offence to possess or use a firearm without being authorised to do so by licence or permit. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 7 is imprisonment for 14 years if the firearm concerned is a prohibited firearm. The standard non-parole period which has been set for an offence under s 7 of the Firearms Act is three years.  
      
      
     16 In her remarks on sentence her Honour said that the five firearms offences which were to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the principal offence called for an increase in the penalties to be imposed for the principal offence.  
      
      
     17 Her Honour also considered the two drug offences to be taken into account required the imposition of an increased penalty for the principal offence, ""they too being matters of an objectively serious nature.""  
      
       
      
     18 In a part of her remarks on sentence her Honour summarised some of the subjective features of the applicant as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “This offender is presently aged 45. He left school at the end of fourth form in 1974, as it then was, and he took up an apprenticeship and obtained trade qualifications as a mechanic. He married and subsequently separated. He has two sons who live with their mother in Brisbane, but he continues to support them financially and remains in touch with them. In 1990 he moved to Rainbow Flat where he purchased the rural property where he now resides. He has lived there ever since doing some part time mechanical work when it becomes available, otherwise, he is in receipt of unemployment benefits.”  
         
        
       
      
     19 Later in her remarks on sentence her Honour observed that the applicant had a criminal record but that it was of no consequence. The applicant's criminal history consisted of a conviction in 1976 for driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood and a charge of malicious damage in 1993 which had been dismissed under s 556A of the Crimes Act, as then in force.  
      
      
     20 A number of character witnesses gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence, who (as her Honour said in her remarks on sentence) testified that the applicant was a law-abiding citizen and an upstanding member of the community.  
      
      
     21 In this application the following grounds of appeal were raised: 
      
       
        
       1. The sentencing judge had erred in her assessment of the objective gravity of the principal offence. 
        
       2. The sentencing judge had erred in her assessment of the objective criminality of the offences to be taken into account. 
        
       3. The sentencing judge had given inadequate weight to the applicant's very favourable subjective circumstances. 
        
       4. The sentencing judge had erred in having regard to the existence of a standard non-parole period for an offence other than the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced. 
        
       5. The sentencing judge had erred in finding that non-custodial sentencing options were not available. 
        
       6. The sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive. 
        
       7. The sentencing judge had failed to consider whether special circumstances existed within  
        
       s 44(2) of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
       
      
      
     22 As to the first ground, it was submitted that her Honour had grossly overstated the criminality in the principal offence; and that the fact that the offence under s 51D(2) had been created, according to the Minister's second reading speech, so that criminals warehousing illegal guns for sale on the black market would be liable to severe punishment did not mean that anyone whose conduct fell within the terms of the section should be severely punished. Her Honour's finding that the applicant's 15 year old son had access to the firearms was criticised on the basis that on the evidence the applicant's son lived most of the time with his mother in Brisbane.  
      
       
      
     23 As to the second ground of appeal, it was submitted that the criminality involved in the offences of failing to ensure the safekeeping of the prohibited firearm and the other firearms had already been taken into account by the sentencing judge in assessing the objective criminality of the principal offence, so that no further penalty would have been warranted by reason of taking those further offences into account; that the other firearm offences to be taken into account were minor; and that the two drug offences of cultivating as few as nine cannabis plants, which the applicant had testified were to be for his own use, and having in his possession as small a quantity as three grams of cannabis seeds, so far from being objectively serious, as her Honour considered, were very minor offences.  
      
      
     24 As to the third ground of appeal, it was submitted that the sentencing judge had given inadequate weight to the virtual absence of any criminal history, the character evidence given in the proceedings on sentence, the very positive pre-sentence report in which the author of the report had said that the Probation and Parole Service had ""no concerns regarding drug or alcohol issues"", her Honour's view that ""it is not a matter where rehabilitation looms large"", that is, her Honour considered there was little risk of the applicant reoffending, and her Honour's finding that the applicant was remorseful.  
      
      
     25 As to the sixth ground, it was submitted that, as a consequence of what had been submitted in support of the first three grounds, the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive.  
      
      
     26 I propose to deal now with the grounds 1, 2, 3 and 6. In my opinion all of grounds 1, 2, 3 and 6 should be upheld.  
      
       
      
     27 The applicant's conduct in having in his possession more than three firearms, one of which was a prohibited firearm, without the firearms being registered or the applicant being licensed to possess them, did fall within s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act and required that some penalty be imposed on the applicant. However, I accept the contention by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge overstated, and seriously overstated, the objective gravity of the principal offence.  
      
      
     28 According to the Minister's second reading speech, the purpose of s 51D was ""to crack down on possession (of firearms) for the purposes of illegal trafficking"" and, as previously stated in this judgment, to ensure that criminals warehousing illegal guns for sale on the black market would be liable to severe punishment. 
      
      
     29 In the present case, there was nothing to suggest that the applicant was in possession of the firearms for the purposes of trafficking in them. The applicant had acquired all of the firearms many years before in legitimate transactions and there was nothing to suggest that he intended to dispose of any of them. The sentencing judge herself was at pains to disclaim any suggestion that she thought that the applicant himself might use any of the firearms to commit a crime. The applicant had been in possession of the prohibited firearm, that is the Bentley pump action shotgun, for 25 years. He had used it for shooting ducks and had last used it 9-12 months before to shoot a snake. The firearms were kept by the applicant at a fairly remote country property about 15 kilometres from Taree, where the applicant lived alone, and, although the firearms were kept mounted on a wall in a cabin on the property instead of being locked away, I consider that her Honour overstated the risk of ""anyone wishing to obtain a firearm to commit a serious crime (having) instant access to the applicant's firearms."" I accept that the applicant's 15 year old son lived most of the time with his mother in Brisbane.  
      
       
      
     30 For the reasons advanced by counsel for the applicant, I consider that her Honour erred in considering that the offences to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the principal offence required the imposition of a significantly increased penalty for the principal offence. The failures to keep the firearms safe so that there was a risk of wrongdoers having access to them had already been taken into account by the sentencing judge as a circumstance of aggravation in assessing the objective criminality of the principal offence. The two drug offences, so far from being objectively serious, were, in my opinion, quite minor.  
      
       
      
     31 I accept that the applicant had very favourable subjective circumstances.  
      
       
      
     32 Having regard to what I consider to be a proper assessment of the objective criminality of the principal offence and of the extent to which the sentence for the principal offence could properly have been increased by reason of the offences to be taken into account and to the applicant's subjective circumstances, I consider that the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly excessive, that leave to appeal against sentence should be granted and that the appeal against sentence should be allowed.  
      
      
     33 In the light of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider the fifth and seventh grounds of appeal. It is also unnecessary to consider the fourth ground of appeal, which raises a question which I consider a two judge Bench of this Court should not endeavour to resolve. It is clear that Div 1A of Pt 4 of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      has no direct application, in that an offence under s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act is not included in the table of offences to Div 1A.  
      
      
     34 Having decided that the appeal should be allowed it is necessary for me to consider what sentence should be imposed in the re-sentencing of the applicant. There is no need for me to repeat the objective facts of the principal offence or of the offences to be taken into account or the subjective features of the applicant. In re-sentencing the applicant I take into account the relevant provisions of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) 
       
     Act 
     .  
      
      
     35 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that, if the appeal was allowed and a lesser sentence was imposed, the Court should order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention or that the sentence should be suspended. It was also submitted that the Court should at least find that there were special circumstances.  
      
      
     36 I consider that the Court should find special circumstances. It is a sufficient ground for a finding of special circumstances that the applicant has never previously been to prison.  
      
      
     37 I have already stated my conclusion that the sentencing judge seriously over-estimated the objective gravity of the principal offence. However, the Legislature has made it clear that the possession of more than three firearms, if the firearms are not registered and the possessor is not authorised to possess them, is a serious offence and is an even more serious offence, if one of the firearms is a prohibited firearm. Although I consider that the sentencing judge over-estimated the likelihood of other persons having access to the applicant's firearms, there was a potential for such firearms to fall into wrong hands and to be used in the commission of crimes.  
      
      
     38 In my opinion, a custodial sentence should be imposed and I do not consider that the Court should order that it be served by way of periodic detention or that any part of the sentence should be suspended.  
      
       
      
     39 In my opinion leave to appeal should be granted. The appeal should be allowed. The sentence imposed by her Honour, Judge English on the 29 August 2003 should be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentence should be imposed: I consider that a non-parole period of one year should be set commencing on the 29 August 2003 and expiring on the 28 August 2004. I consider that the balance of the term of imprisonment should be a further period of one year. The applicant will be entitled to be released from custody on the expiration of the non-parole period on the 28 August 2004. The date on which the total sentence will expire will be the 28 August 2005.

     Judgment 
    1 DUNFORD J: I ask Greg James J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GREG JAMES J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. In the notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence the applicant referred to the sentences which she wished to appeal against, as including a sentence imposed for the offence of break and enter with intent and for the offences of assault with intent to rob whilst in company. She had, on 14 February 2003, been sentenced in the Penrith District Court by her Honour Morgan, DCJ. on her plea of guilty to sentences in respect of the offence of break and enter a warehouse of Watsilla NSD Australia Pty. Limited with intent to steal, a crime under s.113 of the Crimes Act 1900, and the offence of assault with intent to rob, the aggravating circumstance of which was being in company, an offence under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The latter offence is punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 Her Honour also took into account two offences on a Form 1, the first being the offence of detain for advantage under s.90A of the Crimes Act 1900, punishable in the form of the offence, which is not the aggravated form, by a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years; and the offence of being carried in a conveyance taken without the consent of the owner, under s.154A(b) of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is five years imprisonment. It was to these offences that the plea of guilty to which I have earlier referred related, that is to say in particular the plea was entered in relation to the assault with intent to rob offence. Her Honour took into account, with the prisoner’s consent, the additional offences to which I have referred. 
     
      
    4 The prisoner had been found guilty following a trial in October 2002 of the break and enter offence. This two groups of offences were unrelated. 
     
      
    5 The facts relating to the break and enter offence were set out by her Honour in her Honour’s remarks on sentence. On 8 June 2002 police were driving in a marked police vehicle along Huntingwood Drive, Huntingwood. As they passed industrial premises they saw the prisoner in the driveway of those premises. The police turned around and returned to the direction of number 48 and saw the offender run to a white coloured van, which was parked at the side of the premises. They entered the driveway and parked in front of the van. The offender started pushing the horn in the van. The police walked towards the van and then saw a male come from the building via a side window, which had a lower glass panel missing. That male got into the driver’s seat of the van and drove it into the front of the police car, the impact forcing the police vehicle back approximately half a metre.  
     
      
    6 The male driver then reversed the vehicle, drove around the police car, and travelled west along Huntingwood Drive followed by the police vehicle. At the intersection of Huntingwood Drive and Horsley Road, which is controlled by a roundabout, the van drove around the roundabout three times before driving north along Horsley Road towards the Great Western Highway.  
     
      
    7 Approximately 100 metres north of the roundabout the van stopped. The applicant got out and ran into a nearby paddock. The driver reversed the van at high speed into the front of the police vehicle causing more damage and drove off at high speed. The police could not follow because of damage caused to the front of their vehicle. They pursued the applicant into the paddock instead and arrested her a short time later. The applicant was taken back to the Blacktown police station. 
     
      
    8 When police went to the industrial premises at Huntingwood Drive they saw that the majority of the drawers within the office complex had been pulled out and items scattered about. An alarm had been pulled from the wiring and the pane of glass had been removed from the side window from which the male person had exited. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was spoken to by police but exercised her right to silence. The male co-offender had not been identified and arrested.  
     
      
    10 The trial judge concluded, in accordance with the verdict from the jury, that the applicant’s account that she had no knowledge at all of a break-in to the premises was to be rejected and that she plainly acting as a lookout for her co-offender who was stealing from the premises. 
     
      
    11 Following that conviction the matter was stood over for sentence to enable the charges of assault with intent to rob and associated offences to be brought forward before her Honour also.  
     
      
    12 The applicant had, in company with her daughter and son, been charged with the offence of assault with intent to rob, although the other persons were charged with other offences in addition. She pleaded guilty before Sides, DCJ. to the offence of assault with intent to rob and asked that sentence be considered with the matters on the Form 1 which she sought should be taken into account on sentence.  
     
      
    13 The facts in relation to that offence are that at about 1.00 pm on 6 October the victim was parked in his vehicle at Mount Pritchard waiting for his girlfriend to finish work. He was seated in the driver’s seat of his car with the front window open. This applicant together with Bronwyn Russell and Mitchell Russell, her son and daughter, walked toward the car. The daughter was wearing a bag with eye holes cut out on her head and in her right hand she was carrying a knife. She pointed the knife at the victim and told him to move over. She climbed into the driver’s seat. The applicant took a seat in the back seat behind the driver with her son in the seat beside her. The car was driven towards Cabramatta. The victim’s girlfriend saw the vehicle leaving and had seen the three people get into her boyfriend’s car. She, with the assistance of a bystander and the use of his car pursued the vehicle.  
     
      
    14 During the drive the driver, the present applicant’s daughter, felt that she could not see very well because of the bag over her head and took it off although the applicant advised her against removing it. The son placed a knife near the left side of the victim’s face and told him that they were taking him to an ATM and that he should take out the maximum on his cards otherwise the son would stab him. The applicant said, “You’d better get us the money”. 
     
      
    15 As the vehicle approached the intersection of the Cumberland Highway and Cabramatta Road it collided with the rear of another vehicle stopped at the intersection. The vehicle stalled. The daughter asked the victim how to start the car. He offered to drive the car and take them wherever they wanted to go. The son put a knife to his throat and threatened him with it. The victim got out of the car and pretended to walk towards the driver’s side but fled to an adjacent BP service station. The daughter, however, managed to start the car, which sped off with the victim’s mobile telephone and wallet. 
     
      
    16 At about a quarter to two that day the applicant, her son and daughter entered the Goldmark jewellery store at Wetherill Park. They were recorded as doing so on shop security footage and attempted to utilise the credit cards of the victim to buy jewellery unsuccessfully. They were approached by a security guard at a nearby automatic teller machine and after a brief altercation the three went towards a car park. The applicant was picked up by her daughter but was arrested on 7 October. She was shown the security footage from the jewellery store, refused to be interviewed and refused a police line-up.  
     
      
    17 A number of witnesses were later shown an array of photographs that included that of the applicant and a number of other persons. It is sufficient to say that, although they identified her, they were not 100% positive in their identification. 
     
      
    18 The daughter had pleaded guilty before Sides, DCJ. to various offences, acknowledged her guilt of the offences on a Form 1 and was sentenced not only in respect of this matter but also for two charges of malicious wounding and a further charge of assault with intent to rob while armed with an offensive weapon. There were also further matters taken into account. In respect of the offence that the daughter had committed with this applicant a sentence of four years and three months with a non-parole period of two years was imposed but her overall sentence for all the matters on which she was sentenced by Sides, DCJ. was a sentence of six years with a non-parole period of three years. 
     
      
    19 At the time at which the applicant came forward for sentence her son had not then been dealt with and was due for trial. 
     
      
    20 Since one of the submissions made before us raises the question of the sentences imposed upon the daughter with the suggestion of a submission that some parity question might be raised I should turn to the information provided to us in the written submissions filed by the applicant, which were accompanied not only by a transcript of proceedings before the Parole Board, but also portions of a transcript of argument before the trial judge in the present matter and a letter from Mr Hails, solicitor, Prisoners Legal Aid Service, Legal Aid Commission, referring to the sentences imposed upon the daughter Bronwyn Russell and the son Mitchell Russell, apparently having had the extent of those sentences checked by reference to a computer print-out from the Department of Corrective Services. 
     
      
    21 Mitchell Russell’s sentence for the offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed was a sentence of four years and three months with a two year non-parole period; for another offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed a four year sentence cumulative on the non-parole period imposed in respect of the sentence I have referred to but also with a non-parole period of one year and, in addition, for two offences of malicious wounding he received a sentence of two years and six months fixed terms expiring on 6 April 2004. The end effect of all those sentences was that Mr. Russell was not entitled to be considered for parole until 6 October 2004. The sentences expire on 6 October 2007. 
     
      
    22 It becomes immediately apparent in respect of the sentences of both Bronwyn Russell and Mitchell Russell that the sentencing judge had applied the principle of totality, which requires that when sentencing for a multiplicity of offences although the appropriate sentence should be imposed for each offence attention should be given to making the sentences to some extent concurrent for the purposes of avoiding an overall sentence that exceeds the period that would otherwise be appropriate to be served for the overall criminality. That application of principle does not mean that it is appropriate in any given case, and particularly in light of this case, to translate from those sentences to the sentence the applicant had imposed upon her some parity requirement so that one might conclude she should have received less because her children had committed more offences so the sentence are such as to give rise to some justifiable sense of grievance on her part. I see no basis upon which she should have received shorter sentences for the crimes than were imposed upon her, notwithstanding that she submitted in her letter, which accompanied her notice of appeal dated 16 March that the sentence imposed upon her for the crime of assault with intent to rob and the other matters taken into account was too severe. 
     
      
    23 Having regard to the facts of that matter I am unable to see that any lesser sentence would have been appropriate. 
     
      
    24 The applicant has also raised in that letter that there should have been concurrency between the sentences imposed on the break, enter and steal charge with the sentence imposed on the other charges. It is apparent when the commencement date of the sentences for the assault with intent to rob is considered that the sentences were concurrent except for the period of six months. I do not see any error in this regard. 
     
      
    25 Further, she has contended that she was not given the appropriate discount for her plea of guilty in respect of the offences for which she was sentenced for assault with intent to rob yet it is apparent when reading the trial judge’s remarks on sentence that she received a discount of some 25%. I do not see there is any substance in that complaint. 
     
      
    26 The applicant also complained that the sentence was severe and was her first substantial sentence of full time custody. The applicant further complains it is a sentence under which she is undergoing some degree of hardship as she has, including the two co-accused, five children and two grandchildren who are finding her absence hard to cope with. At least her daughter Bronwyn and her son Mitchell are finding her absence hard to cope with but they are not at liberty. 
     
      
    27 The complaint also is that the first sentence should have been backdated, that is to say that the sentence on the charge of break, enter and steal for which she received 18 months imprisonment should have been backdated to commence earlier than 8 November 2001. In her written submissions dated 30 September 2003 and provided to us today, to which I have already referred, the applicant submitted that although she was imprisoned on 8 June 2001, the 18 month sentence not commencing until 8 November 2001, she has been deprived of the benefit of that period before the sentence was passed. With the documentation she has provided is a most confusing discussion before the Parole Board concerning revocation of periodic detention, to which she had been sentenced, and when one looks at the applicant’s prior record it can be seen that the recording may not have been precisely correct from time to time and that there has been a deal of confusion surrounding to what offences periods of custody should be made referable. That is of little moment here since, as the trial judge records in her remarks on sentence, having made an examination of the applicant’s immediately prior custodial record, whether correctly attributing that custody to one or other of her prior offence matters, both the Crown and Mr. Webb, who appeared for the applicant at the sentencing proceedings, had agreed that the most appropriate sentencing date for the commencement date to custody in relation to the offence of break, enter and steal was 8 November 2001. I do not see that it is now appropriate to reconsider that commencement date in those circumstances. 
     
      
    28 I have therefore concluded that notwithstanding the matters raised by the applicant there is no substance in the submissions she has put nor do I see any error in the sentences imposed by the learned trial judge. Indeed, as I have said in relation to the offence of assault with intent to rob in company, I do not see that any lesser sentence could have been imposed. 
     
      
    29 I point out that this was a very serious crime indeed, obviously committed with pre-planning, involving an intent to terrify the victim, to use a weapon and that the offence had been committed in company. It was an offence with a deal of seriousness and one could well consider that in the sentence the trial judge imposed the applicant was treated leniently. 
     
      
    30 In my view the application for leave to appeal should be granted since the matter has been fully argued but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    31 DUNFORD, J: I agree. The orders of the court will be: application for leave to appeal granted; appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Urquhart in the District Court at Coonamble on 28 March 2003 following the applicant's plea of guilty to a charge of aggravated break, enter and steal in company, contrary to s 112 (2) of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.2 His Honour imposed a head sentence of 3 years and a non parole period of 18 months, the sentence to commence on 27 March 2003 being the date on which he was taken into custody.3 His Honour summarised the facts as following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence was committed at a property known as Hulicon on Narawa Road at Coonabarabran. On that property, on 28 October 2001, there was a caravan, an Adco shed, some shipping containers, some vehicles, a bulldozer and some other machinery. The property was about five hundred acres, some cleared and some bushland. It appears clear to me from the evidence that there was a rumour, if that be the right word, that the person whose property it was had on that property a substantial amount of money. It was for the purpose of finding and stealing that money that the prisoner and the co-offender (his brother) attended the property at about 10.30 am on 28 October 2001. They travelled part of the way in a motor vehicle being driven by the prisoner's wife. 
         
        Prior to them setting out on that criminal enterprise they discussed what they were each about to do. They agreed they would go there, search for the money and take it away with them. That particular time of that particular day was chosen because it was thought by the prisoner no-one that was upon the property. When the prisoner and the co-offender reached the property they searched within the Adco shed, after breaking the seal to it and forcing entry. The prisoner thought that the money would be about $20,000. His co-offender thought it could be anything from $1000 to $100,000. Although there was a variety of items of property in the shed neither the prisoner nor his co-offender came upon any money. Items that were within the shed were then removed from the shed and they included a large television, some food stuffs a coin collection, numerous parts of an aeroplane, a camera and other miscellaneous items. That which they had removed, they took onto an adjoining property and hid it there. They then left, walked to the Newell highway and were there collected from by the prisoner's wife who was returning from a shopping trip.” 
        
       
      
    4 The evidence further disclosed that the applicant later returned to the property with his co-offender and his son in his four-wheel drive with trailer in possession of bolt, wire cutters and gloves intending to remove such of the items which they had stolen as they considered might be useful for sale or use, and to further search for the money. When they returned the applicant was confronted by police and arrested whereupon he made full admissions as to his involvement in the offence and continued those admissions in a subsequently recorded interview with police.5 It later turned out that there was in fact $35,000 on the property. The applicant and his co-offender did not find it and the applicant was not charged with attempting to steal that money.6 The applicant was born on 29 March 1965 and, accordingly, was aged 38 at the time of the offence and 39 at the time of sentence. He was raised in the Condobolin and Hillston areas, the eldest of five children of a station-hand and his wife. His parents separated when he was 18, but the separation was described as amicable, and his family life was supportive and he was not subject to any form of abuse.  
     
      
    7 He left school aged 14, in year 7, unable to read or write and with poor arithmetical skills. Some years ago he attempted a literacy course at the local college of TAFE, but was advised that he was dyslexic and this continued to cause problems.  
     
      
    8 Since leaving school he has been exclusively involved in farm work and prior to sentence was running his own property of about 150 acres and, as I understand it, leasing another one of 200 acres where he ran cattle. He was also doing farmhand work for others on nearby properties up to three days a week. He has been in a stable relationship with his partner for some 18 years and they married a few years ago. There were four children of the union aged 17 to 9.  
     
      
    9 He has a prior criminal record including a previous offence of break, enter and steal and some firearm offences in 1985 and a number of stealing offences and one of assault in 1989.  
     
      
    10 More seriously, 26 August 1999 at the Dubbo District Court he was convicted of cultivating a prohibited drug and two counts of supply a prohibited drug and sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months from 17 May 1999 until 16 November 2000 with an additional term of 18 months, subject to supervision. Accordingly, he was on parole for the cultivation offence at the time of the commission of this offence.11 The evidence before his Honour was that on his release he and his wife had increased debts due to his incarceration, a motor vehicle accident which occasioned the necessity for repairs to their vehicle and the drought, and because of his imprisonment he tended to be shunned and ostracized by local people; all that making it more difficult for him to obtain outside work. At the time of the offence his debts amounted to $40,000.  
     
      
    12 His Honour made an express finding that the offence was motivated by need and not by greed. He also found he had suffered a degree of depression following his release on parole. The plea of guilty was entered at an early stage, having both utilitarian value and, together with the admissions made in the course of the record of interview, it also demonstrated the sincerity of his contrition and remorse.13 His Honour found there was a degree of planning though it was not elaborate, but the return to the scene with the bolt and wire cutters and gloves was an aggravating factor. In my opinion, involving his son in the return visit was a further aggravating feature. His Honour gave less weight to general deterrence than would otherwise be the case on account of what he described ""the developmental impairment"" referred to by Doctor Carne, and he found special circumstances justifying a reduction in the standard non-parole period.14 One matter that has figured prominently in the applicant's submissions relates to his assistance to authorities in relation to the death of his sister. In March 2002 the applicant's sister was murdered by her defacto husband of many years standing following domestic disputes, her attempts to leave him, and family negotiation relating thereto in respect of which the applicant had been involved. He provided a statement to police which was exhibit 1 before the learned sentencing judge, and in relation to the applicant's assistance his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner has made a statement to police in respect of that and will be called to give evidence at the murder trial which is listed to take place in the Supreme Court at Dubbo in May this year. The prisoner will be a Crown witness in that.” 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour then went on to refer to the fact that as a consequence of his sister's death the applicant and his wife assumed the care of his sister's five children aged from 5 to 14 and noted that the applicant's assistance as a Crown witness in that murder trial would result in him serving his sentence in protective custody.  
     
      
    16 It has been submitted on behalf of the applicant that, whilst his Honour had regard to the issue of “onerous custody” as a result of the applicant’s assistance, he did not as required by s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 have regard to the usefulness of the offender’s assistance, or the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender, or the likelihood that the offender will commit any further offences if released; and it was submitted that the absence of express reference to such matters in the Remarks on Sentence or the assessment of the discount given for such assistance, his Honour did not have sufficient regard to such assistance.  
     
      
    17 The murder of his sister and his involvement in its aftermath, the investigation of the offence and the trial of the killer must have had a serious, devastating effect on the applicant and contributed to his depressive state of mind in the months leading up to the sentencing proceedings. In addition to all of this, he and his wife took into his home the sister’s five children which would have added to the emotional and financial burdens to which they were already subject. 18 Section 23 provides in summary that a court may impose a lesser sentence than otherwise on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist the law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection, investigation of or proceedings relating to the offence concerned or any other offence, and sets out a number of specific matters to be taken into account. 19 Generally the section applies to accomplices and persons engaged in criminal activity who are able to give police information about offences because they have been accomplices or engaged in other criminal activity, although the section is not so limited; and it is generally accomplices who give evidence against their co offenders who receive substantial discounts such assistance.  
     
      
    20 This was not such a case. It involved the brutal murder of his sister by her husband and, as the deceased’s brother, one would expect that he would be only too happy to assist police in bringing the killer to justice and would not require any incentive or encouragement to do so.21 We have the statement by the accused that he had made to police which was put before his Honour and, although I have some reservations as to whether it is strictly admissible as fresh evidence, the learned Crown Prosecutor has consented to the admission before us of evidence from the investigating police as to the usefulness of such assistance. That material discloses that the applicant supplied police with integral knowledge of the sister and brother-in-law’s relationship along with his knowledge of their movements in the days and weeks leading up to the deceased’s death. 22 He gave evidence, both at committal and at the trial, and such evidence was crucial in the case against the then accused. The police found the Anderson family to be very co-operative and hard working people who rallied around the children for support in the most trying of times, and noted they were still deeply affected by the death of the applicant’s sister, although they did go on to say the evidence supplied was in no way out of the ordinary for someone who has lost his sister as a result of a murder.23 As I say, his Honour did take into account the fact that as a Crown witness in a murder trial, he expected him to serve his sentence on protection but having regard to the fact that it was the murder of his sister, this is not a case where, in my opinion, a substantial or substantial discount was called for in this regard.  
     
      
    24 Although the murder and its aftermath could not constitute a mitigating factor in the commission of the offence, it was a matter which his Honour was entitled to take into account in sentencing the applicant, in my view, his Honour paid insufficient attention to it in all the circumstances.25 I have already referred to the fact that the offence was committed whilst on parole and it was a serious offence. For that reason, I am satisfied that the head sentence imposed by his Honour was well within the range of proper sentencing and discretion. 26 However, his Honour found special circumstances and reduced the non parole period below that specified in the section. Having regard to all the factors to which I have referred, I am of the view that it should have been reduced somewhat further. This will result, of course, in a longer period of parole under supervision and having regard to the comments of his Probation Officer in his report dated 25 March 2003, I am satisfied that this would be beneficial to the applicant in facilitating his rehabilitation, and thus ultimately beneficial to the community.27 I, therefore, propose that leave to appeal be granted, the appeal be upheld, the head sentence confirmed, the non parole period quashed and, in lieu thereof, a non parole period of twelve months be specified commencing on 27 March 2003 and concluding on 26 March 2004.28 I further propose an order that the prisoner be released on parole on that date subject to the conditions imposed by the regulations and the further condition that he place himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of such service.29 GREG JAMES J: I agree. I would add that when this offender came forward for sentence, the circumstances were most unusual if not unique. Not only had he suffered the family tragedy, to which the presiding judge had referred, not only had he been subject to the stresses to which the presiding judge and the trial judge referred, but in addition, even though he had breached his parole, the parole officer had said of him:  
     
      
       
        
        “As outlined in the psychiatric report Mr Anderson appears to have some intellectual deficit and clinical depression. These factors coupled with the frustration Mr Anderson described over his inability to find post release employment, repay debts, be accepted by the local community, the death of his sister and the subsequent care of her five children appear to have been instrumental in his offending behaviour.  
        
       
       
        
        As mentioned above Mr Anderson has a strong work ethic and inquiries indicate that he is a devoted family man. Whilst any supervision with this Service would focus on stabilising his mental health, it is the opinion of this Service that much of Mr Anderson’s anxiety may well diminish following these court proceedings and therefore intervention by this Service would be minimal and mainly consist of a monitoring role. 
        
       
       
        
        Given his work ethic and personal circumstances a community service order may well provide the offender with the opportunity to provide for his family and stabilise his mental health, whilst repaying his debt to the community”. 
        
       
      
    30 The psychiatric report, to which the parole officer had referred, had been attached to the probation and parole report, and had apparently been obtained following the applicant’s solicitor and probation officer becoming aware of indicators of clinical depression in him prior to sentence. 31 The probation officer also recommended the supervision of the Service because of the applicant’s mental condition. 32 The psychiatric report of Dr Carne not only adverts to the various matters referred to by the trial judge in his remarks on sentence but also refers at its conclusion to the impact of custody in his special circumstances having had to take on board the children of the deceased’s sister. That report says:-  
     
      
       
        
        “If Mr. Anderson were to serve a custodial term the following adverse impacts are likely:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Worsening depression and risk of suicide. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The welfare of his children, (his own four children and his sister’s give children) would be put in jeopardy. It is likely that they would lose their property and would have to move. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) His sister’s children are likely to respond poorly to this additional loss so soon after losing their mother and losing contact with their father. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, Mr. Anderson’s professions of remorse are genuine. He is unlikely to offend any further. 
        
       
       
        
        If he were to be sentenced to a period of community service, he would be able to fulfil these obligations and still keep his family together. 
         
        
       
       
        
        I would encourage the court to consider a form of non-custodial disposition.” 
        
       
      
    33 Not withstanding these expressions of opinion, it was plainly open to the trial judge to impose a period of actual custody, having regard to the nature of the offence and the fact it was committed on parole. In my view, the necessity for imposing some period of custody must be upheld. But I share the view of the presiding judge that in all these circumstances the period that was imposed exceeded that which was necessary in the circumstances of the case.34 It is in addition to those reasons given by Dunford J that the orders should be as made.35 DUNFORD J: The orders of the court will be as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: The applicant, Craig Charters, was sentenced by her Honour Judge English on 24 April 2003 in respect of a call-up for breaching a two year sentence imposed by her Honour on 7 June 2002 and partially suspended pursuant to s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.2 The applicant had been sentenced for one offence of ongoing supply, prohibited drug to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1986 contrary and had breached his suspended sentence by the commission of further offences.3 The brief history of the matter is that he was originally sentenced on 7 June 2002 when her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for two years to date from 23 December 2001, the date on which he had been taken into custody, and to expire on 22 December 2003. As I say, the sentence was partially suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act from the date of sentence, namely, 7 June 2002, on the applicant entering into a good behaviour bond subject to conditions.4 The applicant was accordingly released but he repeatedly breached the s 12 bond and was taken into custody on 22 December 2002 in relation to other matters. He was then called up before her Honour on 24 April 2003.  
     
      
    5 Her Honour, after saying: “I am left with no alternative but to revoke his section 12 bond and to impose a sentence of imprisonment for two years”, did precisely that, and sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for two years to date from that date; not from the date of sentence, but from the date on which he had been last taken into custody, namely, 22 December 2002, to expire on 21 December 2004, with a non-parole period of eighteen months, to expire on 21 June 2004.6 However, the applicant had already served or was deemed to have served almost 6 months of the sentence and the unexpired portion of such sentence, at the time he was returned to custody, was 18 months and 2 weeks. The effect of ss 12 and 99 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is that in such circumstances the maximum sentence that can be imposed on the revocation of the s 12 bond and the resentencing is the remaining unserved portion of the original sentence; R v Hyde [2003] NSWCCA 154 a decision post-dated the resentencing by her Honour.  
     
      
    7 It follows that the sentence imposed by her Honour must be set aside and the applicant resentenced. On resentencing, our attention has been drawn to an affidavit by the applicant sworn on 3 February, setting out his progress in prison, and we have been asked to find special circumstances, although her Honour did not do so.8 However, having regard to the applicant’s record and the fact, in particular, that he has breached the bond on which he was released, I am not satisfied that any longer period of release on parole would serve any useful purposes or aid the applicant’s rehabilitation; and, in any event, the exercise becomes academic when one looks at the actual dates involved.9 A sentence of eighteen months and two weeks, to date from 22 December, would expire on 6 July 2004. A sentence of two years would normally involve a non-parole period of six months. Six months from 6 July 2004 means that he should have been released from parole on 5 January this year.10 Her Honour also, by her order, directed that he be eligible for release on parole on the date she fixed. This was an error. Section 50(1) of the Act requires that where a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for a term of 3 years or less, being a sentence that that contains a non-parole period, the Court must make an order releasing the offender at the end of the non-parole period. This her Honour failed to do.11 As I say, we cannot now order his release on 5 January 2004, but we can order his immediate release on parole.12 I, therefore, propose that leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be allowed, that the sentence be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a sentence of 18 months and 2 weeks to date from 22 December 2002 to expire on 6 July 2004.13 I would fix a non-parole period expiring on 5 January 2004 and order that he be released forthwith on parole, subject to the conditions specified by her Honour. 
     
      
    14 GREG JAMES J: I agree.15 DUNFORD J: The order is as I have indicated.

    1 MASON P: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Issa Jada, was tried in the District Court upon a charge of defrauding the Commonwealth: s29D of the Crimes Act (C’th). He was found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He appeals against conviction only.  
     
      
    3 Put shortly, it was the Crown case that the appellant evaded the payment of import duty upon a large quantity of cigarettes which arrived in Australia by sea in a container. Also in the container was a large quantity of plastic household goods. The appellant was said to have been responsible for the shipment, as well as for the preparation of an Australian Customs document known as an “Entry for Home Consumption”, which disclosed the arrival of the plastic goods but not of the cigarettes. It was alleged that he was complicit in the preparation of that document, intending to evade the payment of duty by the dishonest failure to disclose the shipment of the cigarettes. The duty payable on the cigarettes would have been very much greater than that levied upon the plastic goods. 
     
      
    4 The only ground of appeal is that the verdict is unreasonable, having regard to the evidence. This was argued on two bases. The first was that the prosecution evidence, taken at its highest, was incapable of making out the charge as it was particularised in the indictment. The indictment charged that the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        Between about 19 February 2001 and 27 March 2001 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did defraud the Commonwealth in that he did evade the payment of import duty due to the Commonwealth on an importation of cigarettes that was falsely described as “plastic household wares”. 
        
       
      
    5 A Customs officer gave evidence about the documents, including the Entry for Home Consumption, involved in an importation and the clearance of a shipment through Customs. As one might expect, a shipping container sometimes carries the goods of more than one owner. In the present case, however, the Entry for Home Consumption document conveyed that the only goods in the container were five hundred and twelve “packages” of plastic household wares, all the property of one owner.  
     
      
    6 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the terms of the indictment, alleging the false description of cigarettes as plastic household wares, did not reflect the evidence. There were in fact plastic goods in the container. What the evidence established was that in it there were also cigarettes, and that these had not been declared in the Customs document. Accordingly, it was argued, the indictment should have alleged a failure to disclose the presence of the cigarettes, rather than a misdescription of them.  
     
      
    7 The argument does not withstand critical analysis. The matter should be approached with an eye to the principle that failure to disclose relevant information, particularly when there is a duty to do so, may amount to an untrue representation: R v Evans (CCA, unreported, 11 December, 1997). What the indictment alleged was “an importation of cigarettes that was falsely described as plastic household wares” (my emphasis). The Customs document conveyed that the importation was of plastic goods only. It was not: it was also of cigarettes. In that sense, it could fairly be said to have been “falsely described”. 
     
      
    8 The indictment might have been expressed in the manner suggested by counsel for the appellant. However, the manner in which it was framed was appropriate in the light of the evidence. 
     
      
    9 Otherwise, counsel argued that, on the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, relying upon the familiar principles to be found in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. The Crown presented a fairly detailed circumstantial case against the appellant but, given the defence case, it is not necessary to examine the evidence at any length. 
     
      
    10 For some years the appellant had been in the business of importing goods, including plastic goods of the kind in question. He frequently used a particular Customs broking company and it was that company which dealt with the relevant shipment. A number of his previous importations had been inspected by Customs officers, and on some of those occasions goods had been damaged in the process. In addition, he personally had been the subject of Customs scrutiny when returning from overseas trips.  
     
      
    11 The appellant had imported goods from the Philippines over a number of years, dealing through an agent in that country. It was from the Philippines that the relevant shipment came to Australia. In evidence at the trial, the appellant denied any knowledge of the cigarettes in the container but he acknowledged that it was he who had imported the plastic goods. However, he went about it in a most unusual way. 
     
      
    12 In dealing with the shipping company which conveyed the container to Australia, the Customs broking company, and a transport company engaged to deliver the container after its arrival here, the appellant did not use his own name or the business name under which he traded. He represented the owner of the goods to be Cumberland Plastics Pty Limited. There was such a company at premises at Liverpool, but it was not the importer of the goods and it was not suggested that the appellant had any interest in it.  
     
      
    13 To the shipping company, the Customs broker and the transport company the appellant supplied a mobile phone number, said to be that of Cumberland Plastics. It was not that company’s number, but had been subscribed to about a month before the importation in the name “Joseph Nicholas” of an address which proved to be non-existent. He used the false name, Joseph Nicholas, when dealing with the transport company. He directed that company to deliver the container, purportedly to Cumberland Plastics, at 19 Penny Place, Arndell Park. That was not that company’s address, but he rented a storage unit at 29 Penny Place.  
     
      
    14 This was evidence in the Crown case which, by and large, the appellant did not dispute. He gave evidence that he sought to distance himself from the importation, not because of any involvement in the smuggling of cigarettes, but because of the previous scrutiny by Customs to which I have referred, which he saw as persistent, unwarranted and detrimental to his business.  
     
      
    15 Before the container was delivered to the Arndell Park address Customs became aware that Cumberland Plastics was not the importer of the goods, and an inspection of the container exposed the cartons of cigarettes. It was decided to conduct a “controlled delivery” of the container, and it was driven to Arndell Park by an employee of the transport company, accompanied by a Customs officer. Upon arrival at the nominated address, 19 Penny Place, it was apparent that there was nothing to connect those premises with Cumberland Plastics. 
     
      
    16 It was the Crown case that the appellant approached the truck driver and asked what he was looking for. When the driver said that he was trying to find Cumberland Plastics, the appellant directed him to the storage unit at 29 Penny Place. There the appellant, assisted by some other men, unloaded the cartons from the container and placed them in the storage unit. He declined the truck driver’s offer to help with the unloading. 
     
      
    17 Later, Customs officers entered the storage unit, to find that the cartons which contained the plastic goods were stored on one side and those containing the cigarettes on the other, with an access corridor left between them. The appellant was arrested. He gave his name as “Joseph” and, when asked for identification, said that he had none in his possession.  
     
      
    18 In evidence, the appellant denied having refused the truck driver’s offer of assistance. He said that it was the men who were helping him, not he, who decided how the cartons should be placed within the storage unit. He acknowledged having given the name “Joseph” on his arrest and having falsely denied that he had identification on his person, but he said that this was because he was afraid that Customs would discover that he had used a false name for the purpose of the importation and he panicked.  
     
      
    19 In the defence case there was evidence, which was not contested, that the relevant documentation had been prepared by the appellant’s agent in the Philippines and that the plastic goods had been packed for shipment at a commercial packing house in the Philippines at a time when the appellant was in Australia. His evidence was that the goods which arrived were not all that he had ordered, and there was undisputed evidence that a further shipment of goods of that kind arrived here some months later. It was his case that the cigarettes must have been loaded into the container in the Philippines by accident or design, but in either event without his knowledge. It was argued at trial, as it was in this Court, that that was an inference reasonably available on the whole of the evidence.  
     
      
    20 There was other evidence, to which I find it unnecessary to refer to decide this ground of appeal. It is sufficient to say that it was open to the jury, acting reasonably, to reject the evidence of the appellant in so far as it was in conflict with evidence in the Crown case and, in particular, to reject the explanation which he proffered for his admitted course of deception. Equally, it was open to the jury to characterise as fanciful the proposition that the cigarettes were in the container without his knowledge and to be satisfied to the requisite degree of his involvement in their shipment to Australia. I my view, there was ample evidence to establish the appellant’s guilt of the offence charged. 
     
      
    21 I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    22 SMART AJ: I agree with Hidden J. The Entry For Home Consumption, The Manifest and The Bill of Lading each stated that what was being imported was 1 container containing 512 pcs/crtns of assorted plastic Household Wares (or Housewares). The Consignee and Owner was shown as Cumberland Plastics Pty Ltd. In fact, within the container were either 290 or 300 cartons each holding a total of 10,000 cigarettes and a number of boxes of religious statues and ornaments. The cigarettes attracted import duty of $600,000. 
     
      
    23 The evidence establishes that the majority of the importation comprised cigarettes and they were falsely described as ""plastic household wares"". The indictment sufficiently covered the facts which emerged in the evidence. 
     
      
    24 Hidden J has briefly summarised the devious conduct of the applicant and his attempts to hide his connection with it from official eyes. Such conduct, despite his explanations, makes it impossible to accept his assertion that he had never imported cigarettes. The Crown case was very strong and the defence case was fanciful. 
     
      
    25 The appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

      FRIDAY 13 FEBRUARY 2004 
       
       
      
    70013/03 R v Steven Anthony FRASER 
     
      
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HOWIE J: On 20 October 2003, the offender Steven Anthony Fraser was convicted by a jury of three counts of murder arising from the death of his three young children on the weekend of 18-19 August 2001. At the outset of the trial he pleaded guilty to a count of manslaughter in respect of each of the killings on the basis of the defence of substantial mental impairment under s 23A of the Crimes Act. The Crown, however, refused to accept the pleas in discharge of the indictment and the trial proceeded. The only issue for the jury to determine was whether they were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defence under s 23A had been made out by the offender. Clearly the jury rejected that defence. 
     
      
    2 The facts upon which the offender is to be sentenced are not substantially in dispute and are as follows. The offender and his wife, Maria Chona Fraser, commenced a relationship in 1993 and married in 1995. There were three children of the relationship: Ashley, who was born on 6 June 1994; Ryan, born on 20 September 1995; and Jarrod, born on 11 December 1996. Therefore, on the date of their deaths the children were aged respectively 7 years, 5 years and 4 years. 
     
      
    3 The relationship between the offender and his wife was a troubled one, and on a number of occasions they separated and then reconciled. On more than one occasion during their many arguments, the offender threatened that, if his wife ever left him, she would never see the children again and he made unspecific threats of harming the children. 
     
      
    4 In late 1997, Mrs Fraser again separated from the offender and moved into a house in Chippendale, with the children. She had formal custody of them four days a week. However, the offender and his wife adopted a flexible arrangement in relation to custody of, and access to the children. Sometimes the offender would take the children for a few days, and on other occasions only for a few hours. At times he would baby-sit the children at their home while his wife was at work. For a period of about 15 months the offender lived at the house in Chippendale. At all times Mrs Fraser encouraged the offender to spend time with the children, believing that it was good for them. 
     
      
    5 In early 2001 the offender moved into a flat in Caringbah having told his wife that he did not intend to live with her again because he had never loved her. He remained in contact with the children and would take them out on the weekends. On occasions he stayed at the house at Chippendale. 
     
      
    6 In May of that year Mrs Fraser informed the offender that she intended to take the children to the Philippines to see her parents during the July school holidays. The offender told her that he did not want the children to go without him but he signed passport forms for the children. However, the offender refused to allow passports to be issued to the children and Mrs Fraser obtained a court order permitting her to obtain them. The offender’s mother purchased him a ticket to the Philippines but eventually he decided he would not make the journey. On 21 June 2001, when the wife and children were about to board the aircraft to fly to the Philippines, they learned that the offender had obtained an order preventing them from leaving the country. When immigration officials spoke to the offender, he refused his consent for the children to leave Australia and Mrs Fraser and the children returned home. 
     
      
    7 This led Mrs Fraser to make an application to the Local Court to permit her to take the children to the Philippines. She also applied for a variation of the access orders reducing the period during which the offender would have formal access to the children. These applications were set down for hearing on 27 August 2001. In the meantime, the offender continued to see the children as he had done previously. 
     
      
    8 At some time during the July school holidays Mrs Fraser began a relationship with another man, who throughout the trial was known as Sam. On Monday 13 August, Sam was at the house in Chippendale when the offender’s mother arrived and saw him there. Later Mrs Fraser rang the offender’s mother and informed her that she and Sam were seeing one another. When the offender learned of this relationship, and having confirmed it with one of the children, he expressed his concern to his mother that he might lose the children. He said that he was in “emotional pain”. 
     
      
    9 The following Thursday night, 16 August, the offender rang his wife and began questioning her about whether she was having a sexual relationship with Sam and the nature of their sexual activities. The offender was aggressive and abusive at times during this conversation, to the point that his wife finally terminated the call. He called her again later that night but this time his tone was more conciliatory although he was still pressing for information about her relationship with Sam. 
     
      
    10 On the following day, the offender contacted his wife to make arrangements to collect the children for the weekend. It was arranged that they would meet at the Rocks at about 12.30 pm. However on Saturday the offender arrived at the house at Chippendale and tried to persuade his wife to break with Sam and recommence their relationship. He promised to allow her to take the children to the Philippines if she went back to him. The conversation continued over many hours and was a highly emotional one for both parties. 
     
      
    11 At about 4pm that afternoon, Mrs Fraser suggested to the offender that he should leave and take the children with him. However, he continued to further question his wife about her intentions with Sam and to press her for a reconciliation. During this conversation, he said words to the effect, “You will never have these children. How would you feel if you didn’t have these children?” Although these remarks made Mrs Fraser anxious, the offender joined the family in a meal and seemed to become calmer. At one stage in the afternoon he appeared to have a fainting fit but recovered. 
     
      
    12 At about 7pm that evening, Mrs Fraser told the offender that she was going out with Sam that night and that he was welcome to stay at the house or take the children as he chose. The offender asked his wife not to go out and to stay with him and the children, but she refused. Eventually the offender left with the children in Mrs Fraser’s car. This was the last time that she saw the children alive. 
     
      
    13 Late on the Sunday evening, the offender rang his wife in an angry mood. He told her that he had phoned the night before and she had not been home. He began to question her about intimate details of her relationship with Sam. At one stage, after his wife told him that Sam thought that she and the offender should be reconciled, if there were any chance of the relationship continuing, the offender said, “Is that because he is son of Sam the serial killer?” The significance of that statement was lost on Mrs Fraser at the time. During this conversation the offender said to his wife words to the effect that she would be the one left behind to take the blame. They both became angry and she terminated the call and disconnected the phone. 
     
      
    14 That evening the offender spoke to his mother in a highly emotional state telling her of his conversations with his wife and her intention to continue the relationship with Sam. He was having difficulty speaking and was sobbing such that his mother was concerned about his welfare. She asked him whether he had taken anything but the offender simply told her he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. So concerned was his mother, that she made contact with a private hospital seeking assistance, but was told to ring back the next morning. 
     
      
    15 At 9.00am Monday morning the offender’s mother rang the hospital but she was told that they were unable to assist her. She then went with her sister to the offender’s flat but could not get any response from her son. The front door was locked. She contacted a locksmith who eventually arrived and opened the front door. He entered the premises but quickly returned outside and advised the offender’s mother not to go inside. He said, “They are all gone”. She did not enter the flat but could see from the doorway a mattress on the floor and one of her grandsons lying on it. 
     
      
    16 When police entered the building they found that the three children were dead and the offender naked in a bath full of water. He was conscious and in the act of drinking a milky substance. 
     
      
    17 There was no dispute at the trial that the accused had killed his children by drowning them in the bath after having administered sleeping tablets to them in order to subdue them. He had killed the two boys about the same time and some hours, perhaps as much as 24 hours, before killing his daughter. He had then consumed a large quantity of sleeping tablets and got into the bath expecting that he would fall asleep and drown. In all probability the children were dead when he telephoned his wife and his mother on the Sunday night. The reference to Sam being a serial killer in the conversation with his wife may well be a reference to the fact that the children were dead and Sam was responsible. 
     
      
    18 Before attempting suicide the offender had prepared the unit in the belief that his wife would be the first person to enter the premises on the Monday morning. He had deliberately set out to create a horrifying spectacle for her benefit. It was to be a scene from her worst nightmare and one that she would never forget. Immediately on entering the unit, his wife would have been confronted with the sight of one of the children’s toys, a stuffed monkey, hanging from a noose and with a knife through its body. The hands had been severed and were lying on the floor. The offender had placed tomato sauce around the entry and exit points of the knife through the toy and on the floor beneath to give the appearance of blood. The offender later told a psychiatrist that this represented his wife and his anger toward her. 
     
      
    19 Next she would have come across the body of Ryan lying on a mattress in the loungeroom. The offender had written on the child’s face, “I love you Ryan, RIP. XO”. The last two letters evidently were meant to indicate a kiss and a hug. On one of the loungeroom’s walls he had written, “I’m waiting, Sam. Come to Papa”. Alongside this was written “Real Fisherman do not feel sorry for the bait!” On another wall there was written, “We have nothing to beer but beer itself”. There appeared to have been attempts made to wipe the writing from the walls. On the door of the linen cupboard the offender had written out the words of a once popular song, “Che sera sera”.  
     
      
    20 Next in the main bedroom was the body of Jarrod lying on the double bed. The offender had written on his face, “I love you Jarrod, RIP”, the word “love” being represented by a heart. There were also symbols representing kisses and a hug. Above the bed was written, “ I’m not to be toyed with!” The word “toyed” was written over the word “trifled”. 
     
      
    21 In the second bedroom was the body of Ashley lying on the bottom of a double bunk. On the wall of that room was written, “There is no place like home!!” Post-mortem examination of Ashley revealed marks consistent with pressure having been applied to her neck and other injuries apparently inflicted at the time of her death. They are consistent with her having struggled violently against the offender’s efforts to drown her. 
     
      
    22 On the offender’s computer there was a screen saver on which was written the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “ 
        chona, you were forever telling me that you would take our children from me 
        … 
        .i always promised you that come what may, Ashley, Ryan, and Jarrod would be with me forever together, always 
        … 
         always 
        … 
        with or without you 
        ” 
         
        
       
      The evidence was that on 19 August 2001 the computer had been programmed so that this screen saver would automatically be displayed when the computer was turned on. 
       
      
    23 The offender was removed from the bath after a struggle during which he attempted to put his head under the water. With some difficulty he was restrained and removed from the unit. He asked arresting police to let him kiss his children. He was conveyed to hospital under restraint. 
     
      
    24 Initially the offender acted in a bizarre manner, with severe mood changes. He sobbed, wailed, and thrashed about in an apparent endeavour to injure himself. At one point he appeared to reach out and cried out, “Don’t die. Don’t die”. He indicated to a police officer guarding him by signs that he wanted the officer to shoot him with his service pistol. Eventually, however, he began to regain his senses and spoke to the police officer for some time about general matters unrelated to the killing of the children. At one stage he whispered something to a security guard. When the police officer repeated to a superior officer what he had been told by the security guard as being said by the offender, the offender interrupted to correct him. He thereafter commenced a lengthy monologue concerning the death of the children. 
     
      
    25 As best as his statements could be taken down by the police officer they were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “ 
        I love my kids more than anything. My kids were going to be taken away by my wife and I told her that my kids would always be with me. No way I was going to leave them do that to my children, put them through misery for the rest of their lives, to be driven insane by the unreciprocated love. I loved my wife. We had problems. 
         
         
        More than anything I wanted my children to have their mother and father together. She called me a sperm donor, that she doesn 
        ’ 
        t want a man in her life. She is fucking another guy. She had an abortion at Christmas and I still came back. I said we 
        ’

I wanted her to be in a coma. She kept waking up. I gave her 15 tablets, she wanted to play. I gave her another 15 tablets, she vomited. I put her in the bath. I couldn

        t let my children live the rest of their life thinking their father had died of a drug overdose. In one way I feel relieved because I stopped them from feeling pain. 
        ” 
         
        
       
      
    26 Another police officer, who also overheard what the offender said, recorded him as saying, amongst other things, “Do you know how hard it was for me to kill my children? I took drugs to do it, otherwise I couldn’t have done it.” 
     
      
    27 A doctor who was present recorded the offender as saying that he was relieved “that they are resting in peace but I will probably go to hell for it.” That doctor was of the view that the offender was at the time a high suicide risk. 
     
      
    28 Later when Detectives spoke to the offender he said, “I know what you think of me. I only did it for my kids. I don’t want them to suffer like I did.” When he was informed that they were investigating the death of Ashley, the offender said, “Is she dead? Is she dead or was she saved? I hope that she is dead. I don’t want her to suffer any more like I did.” Later when informed that the three children were dead, the accused stated, “They are dead. They are all dead. I’m glad they won’t suffer like me. They won’t be abused like I was. Everybody’s been abused and molested. You’ve been abused haven’t you?” Later he said to the police, “I don’t want them to suffer. I don’t want them to be abused. You’re going to send me to gaol where I will get raped”. 
     
      
    29 Subsequent investigations by police revealed that prior to the death of the children the offender had attended on a number of medical practitioners principally in an attempt to obtain Mogadon or some similar medication. 
     
      
    30 On 15 August while Dr Haddad was in the course of a home visit to a patient he was asked to speak to the offender who was present in the premises at the time. The offender indicated that he was having trouble coping and was being frustrated over his children. He explained that he had certain ideas about the way he wanted to live his life with his family. He asked the doctor to prescribe Rohypnol, but he refused to do so. He gave the offender a script for Mogadon. 
     
      
    31 The offender saw a number of doctors on 16 August. He told Dr Mak that he was stressed and could not sleep because he was separated from his wife and there were court proceedings regarding custody of the children. The offender asked for sleeping tablets and was prescribed Mogadon. 
     
      
    32 He attended his local general practitioner, Dr Orphanides. He told the doctor that he was concerned that he had less access to his children and that his wife was taking them overseas, having tricked him into signing the passports. He also referred to a court case. The offender asked the doctor for Mogadon. However, despite the offender’s insistence that he be prescribed that drug, the doctor refused to do so. 
     
      
    33 The offender also went to the Miranda Medical Centre and was given a prescription for Mogadon. 
     
      
    34 At about 6pm that evening the offender attended the surgery of Dr Ullman who had treated him on a number of occasions since 1993 for tension and anxiety. The offender said that he required Mogadon to help him sleep and was agitated about a pending court case. 
     
      
    35 An inspection of the offender’s computer revealed that searches of the Internet had been made for the words “Mogadon”, “Rohypnol” and “methods of suicide”. Searches had been conducted for the words “Rohypnol”, “Mogadon” and “Serepax” on 17 August 2001. 
     
      
    36 The killing of the children should be seen against the fact that in January 2001 the offender had told Dr Orphanides that he might commit suicide and take the three children with him. The doctor was so concerned at the offender’s mental state that he arranged for him to be taken by ambulance to the Prince of Wales Hospital. Dr Orphanides had referred the offender to a mental health team on a number of occasions, the latest being in December 2000 because he was distressed and hypomanic. The doctor believed that the offender suffered from a severe mood disorder and has on occasions prescribed medication to relieve his depression. 
     
      
    37 The facts surrounding the killings show it to be a most serious act of criminality when viewed objectively. I refrain from using more emotive words to describe what the offender did in taking the lives of his innocent children. The killings were planned before he attended the house to collect them on the Saturday at least on a contingency basis in case he did not get his own way with his wife. When he failed to convince her to give up her relationship with Sam, I have no doubt the children’s fates were already decided as he drove them away from their mother and the safety of their home. 
     
      
    38 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his motivation in killing the children was at least in part to punish his wife for her conduct toward him. The offender was frustrated in his desire to control his wife and children and intended to make his wife pay for her defiance of his wishes. He did not want her to take the children to the Philippines, he was concerned about the imminent custody case, and he saw the relationship with Sam as the end of any chance of his being reconciled with his wife and living with her and the children. The offender had made it plain to his wife that, if he were forced to take action against the children in order to deprive her of them, it would be her fault and she would have to live with the guilt. No doubt in part this has turned out to be true. 
     
      
    39 Some of the things that the offender wrote on the walls of the unit are chilling proof that the killings were to be used as an act of revenge for his wife’s defiance in refusing to cease the relationship with Sam. In particular the statement, “Real fisherman do not feel sorry for the bait” is terrible in its implications as to his purpose in killing the children. The statement “I’m not to be trifled (or toyed) with” is clearly a message to his wife. The killings were to some extent symptomatic of the offender’s self-centeredness in his marital relationship. Much of his complaints to the medical practitioners, who saw him before the killings, concerned his frustration at being thwarted in his desire to control his wife and continue the relationship on his terms. To this extent the killings were a selfish act of spite or, at least, were to be used as such. 
     
      
    40 There are a number of aggravating features attending the killings that make it objectively a very serious case of multiple murders. The fact that the victims were vulnerable children is itself a matter of aggravation. The offender as their father was under a duty, and in a position of trust, to care for them while they were absent from their mother. As I have already mentioned, the killings were planned with the applicant obtaining the drugs before he saw his wife on the Saturday. He had been searching the Internet to obtain relevant information as to the effect of various drugs for the purpose of killing the children and himself. The killings occurred over the weekend and Ashley was murdered some significant time after the two boys. The children, in particular Ashley, died violently struggling against the hands of the person who should have been protecting them. Ashley was injured in her attempts to resist the offender and it is clear that he physically assaulted her in some way in order to subdue her. Of course the offender had wished to drug the children, no doubt hoping to save them the horror of drowning, but he proceeded with this method of killing notwithstanding that they were not rendered unconscious by the drugs he gave them. 
     
      
    41 It is also a matter of aggravation that one of the motives that the offender had in what he did was to punish his wife and to take the children away from her. I will say more about the applicant’s mental state and his object in killing the children, but in so far as he intended their deaths to be a lesson to her, that it would produce the consequence that she would lose the children, and that she was to be held responsible for his actions, the killings were cruel over and above a consideration of the acts that brought about the death of the children. 
     
      
    42 A matter in contest during the trial was whether the offender had consumed some substance before the killings to enable him to perform such a dreadful act. I have no doubt that he did. This is what he told the police the next morning and he said the same to Dr Carne and Dr Westmore. It matters little what it was or how it affected him. He had decided to kill the children and took the substance to make it possible for him to put his plans into effect. Generally speaking it is a matter of aggravation that a person consumes some drug, often alcohol, in order to be able to commit a criminal offence. But in this case that fact must be seen against the offender’s disturbed thought processes arising from his underlying mental condition to which I will refer shortly. 
     
      
    43 The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. That sentence is generally reserved for a case falling within the worst category of murder. Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. 
        
       
       
      Section 61(3) states that nothing in subs 1 affects s 21(1) of the Act. Section 21(1) provides that for any offence, which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life, the court may impose a sentence for a specified term.  
       
      
    44 It has been recognised that there is a tension in the terms of section 61 between, on the one hand, the apparent mandatory requirement to impose life imprisonment where s 61(1) applies and, on the other, the retention of a discretion whether to impose such a sentence preserved by s 61(3). The tension is resolved by acknowledging that, notwithstanding that s 61(1) would apply to the facts of a particular case, the sentencing court nevertheless retains a discretion not to impose a life sentence. That discretion might be exercised where the subjective features of a particular case displace the prima facie need for the maximum penalty. 
     
      
    45 It has been held that the fact that there were multiple murders committed could be taken into account in determining whether a life sentence was required for any one of the offences; R v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409. It was also recognised in that case that a particular offence could be so heinous in its objective facts that little, if any, regard should be given to the subjective circumstances of the offender. But the subjective circumstances there being referred to are those matters which would normally suggest that leniency is called for as a matter of compassion or in aid of the rehabilitation of the offender. 
     
      
    46 Considering simply the objective facts surrounding the killing of the children the offences would, in my view, be of such seriousness that they would justify the imposition of the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. They are offences falling within the worst category of murders. It should be noted that the maximum penalty is not preserved for the worst case imaginable and, unfortunately, it is always possible to think of factual scenarios that, for some reason or other, may be considered to be worse than the offence before the court; Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 385. With the offence of murder, in particular, there will often be cases that justify the imposition of the maximum penalty even though such a sentence has been imposed for offences which are more heinous or dreadful, or where the offender poses more of a threat to the community, than the case before the court. The simple fact is that life imprisonment is the most severe sentence that can be imposed and, therefore, it may be the appropriate sentence for a range of factual scenarios which, as between themselves, differ in the degree of seriousness of the offence committed or the moral culpability of the offender. 
     
      
    47 During the course of submissions on sentence the Senior Crown Prosecutor conceded that this was not a case that warranted the imposition of a life sentence, notwithstanding s 61 or the objective facts that I have so far recited. This concession was made both orally and in writing by the State’s most senior and experienced prosecutor, Mr Tedeschi QC. It was a considered stance and one made on the basis of well-established legal principles and the facts of this particular case. It was made notwithstanding that the Crown, having refused to accept pleas of manslaughter, had vigorously pressed the jury for verdicts of murder. I understand that this concession, having been erroneously attributed to me by one or more members of the media, was met with condemnation by at least one public commentator. 
     
      
    48 The Crown’s concession was not based upon considerations of unmerited leniency or a failure to appreciate the objective seriousness of the acts of the accused in taking the life of his children. Rather it was a proper acceptance of the fact that the offender’s culpability for the killings was significantly reduced by reason of his mental state at the time of the killings. The Crown conceded that the offender’s culpability was not such that s 61 applied. The Crown, as the representative of the community and knowing all the facts and circumstances surrounding the killings, accepted that the community’s interest in retribution, punishment, protection, and deterrence did not warrant the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment. That concession was well founded. It ought not to be called into question by those who merely react emotionally to the appalling objective facts that are presented without any understanding or acknowledgement of sentencing principles or the law as laid down by Parliament. 
     
      
    49 The fact that the jury rejected the defence based upon the offender’s mental condition at the time of the killings does not mean that a sentencing court can have no regard to his mental state when determining what punishment is to be imposed upon him for his criminal conduct. The Crown, as it had to, accepted that it was a relevant factor in determining the appropriate sentence. There has never been any dispute that the offender was in a highly disturbed and disordered mental state at the time of the killings and in the days leading up to them. The evidence of the three psychiatrists called at the trial was that the offender was at the time of the killings suffering from a severe mental disorder as a result of a long-standing underlying mental abnormality. The only dispute was as to whether the condition fell within the, somewhat, technical requirements of s 23A of the Crimes Act. The jury’s rejection of the defence under that section can be understood to be a result of their assessment of whether the offender should, by reason of his mental state, be found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. As I told the jury repeatedly in the summing up, this was a matter for them and not the psychiatrists giving evidence. It was a moral judgment based upon their assessment of his mental state and his physical acts. 
     
      
    50 Even without evidence of the psychiatrists, it must be obvious that the offender was mentally disturbed at the time of the killings. There is no dispute that he loved his children dearly. Paradoxically the killings were in part a testament to his deep feelings for them. There is nothing to suggest that the offender had ever harmed his children before this weekend. He only seriously thought of injuring them when he became so mentally disturbed that he was suicidal. Under the effects of his mental disorder, he became obsessed with their safety and their welfare, fearing that they would be sexually molested or mentally abused if they were permanently separated from him. And yet he believed that the only way they could be saved was to kill them. The evidence of the state in which he set up the unit and the ritualistic way he placed the children after he had killed them, clearly shows how disturbed his mind was at the time. 
     
      
    51 The offender acted with conflicting emotions and motives. As I said earlier, I am satisfied that he acted to punish his wife by taking the children from her and causing her to believe that she was responsible. But I am also satisfied that he intended to kill himself and believed that it was necessary to save the children from what he foresaw would be the harm they would suffer without him. There is no doubt at all that he genuinely attempted suicide after killing the children. There was something symbolic in the fact that he attempted to drown himself as he had drowned the children. 
     
      
    52 Although there was a dispute at the trial between the psychiatrists as to whether the offender fell within the mental condition as described in s 23A, that controversy was only as to the degree of his disturbance and whether his capacity to judge the wrongfulness of his actions was substantially impaired. The only factual dispute was whether the offender had needed, and obtained, Dutch courage by consuming alcohol or some other substance before the killings and what that revealed about his mental capacities. Although I am satisfied that he did take some substance to steel himself to carry out the killings, I do not think that the jury’s verdicts were based upon a resolution of this dispute in favour of the Crown. I believe that the jury were not persuaded that in all the circumstances the accused should be relieved of a finding of murder because of his mental condition, notwithstanding that he was clearly suffering from a mental disorder at the time. I am of the opinion that a significant matter in the jury reaching their verdicts was the fact that the offender, in part at least, killed the children to punish his wife. The nature of the killings was also, in my view, a highly relevant matter in the jury’s determination that the appropriate verdict in each case was murder rather than manslaughter. 
     
      
    53 I am satisfied that the offender’s culpability is reduced by reason of his mental condition, as the Crown conceded. In particular his ability to judge the moral wrongfulness of his actions was disturbed. I see nothing inconsistent in the offender being of the disordered belief that it was necessary to kill his children for their benefit but not having the courage of his conviction without strengthening his resolve by the use of alcohol or drugs. 
     
      
    54 However, the offender is to be sentenced in accordance with the jury’s verdicts; that means a sentence appropriate to reflect the fact that he intentionally and with premeditation murdered three young children by drowning them. As I have already indicated, I believe that the objective facts would warrant the imposition of a life sentence. But the offender’s culpability, and therefore his punishment, is to be reduced by reason of his impaired reasoning at the time when he was planning to take their lives and at the time of the killings. He realised what he did was wrong, in the legal sense, but he acted in part from a belief that it was a necessary evil in the best interests of the children. 
     
      
    55 The offender is 35 years of age, with no prior criminal record of any kind. There is nothing to suggest that he was normally a violent man or that in his right mind he would harm the children or his wife. Clearly a relevant matter to an understanding of the offender’s mental disturbance was that his parent’s separated when he was very young and he had been sexually abused when aged 10 years. He had to give evidence in court against the perpetrator and the experience left him fearful of attending court. This added to his anxiety about the forthcoming custody case. 
     
      
    56 He had an unhappy childhood at boarding school where he was constantly bullied and mistreated by other boys. This resulted in a lack of confidence in himself and a difficulty in maintaining relationships with others. He is to a significant degree immature for his age. His selfishness and self-centeredness is part of his pathology. 
     
      
    57 Shortly after he left school the offender suffered his first bout of psychiatric disturbance resulting in a suicide attempt. He was diagnosed as having schizophrenia and received psychiatric treatment. There was another suicide attempt in 1987 followed by another admission for treatment. In 1989 he received further psychiatric treatment resulting in his being prescribed anti-psychotic medication. During the period between admissions he lived with his mother and worked in various occupations. In 1992 he again attempted suicide after the person with whom he was then in a relationship had their child aborted. The diagnosis was that he was suffering from depression rather than schizophrenia. In 1993 he met his wife. 
     
      
    58 It is unnecessary to detail the psychiatric findings. The offender has been occasionally mentally disturbed since the age of 19 as a result of an underlying mental condition. During the relationship with his wife, at times of conflict, he would threaten suicide or to take the children way from her. In the days before the killings he become preoccupied with thoughts of his own death and the resulting harm to the children who, he believed, would be at risk of abuse and trauma such as he had suffered. In particular he believed that any person who commenced a relationship with his wife would sexually abuse the children. These thoughts were obsessive at the time of the killing. Although he had spoken before about killing himself and the children, it appears that he made no preparations to carry out his threat nor attempted in any way to put these thoughts into action. I think that they were more likely empty threats made in an attempt to control his wife and their relationship. However, as he came to the realisation that it was certain that the relationship would come to an end, so these thoughts of suicide and killing the children took on a different complexion. 
     
      
    59 The killings took place on this particular weekend because of a combination of stresses that resulted in the offender becoming suicidal. These were the threat of the children being taken to the Philippines, the impending custody case, and the end of his relationship with his wife because of her relationship with Sam. The killings occurred when they did, not simply because he provided himself with Dutch courage but because he had reached the point where he believed that his fears were going to become facts. 
     
      
    60 Dr Carne diagnosed the offender as possibly suffering from a personality disorder with borderline and paranoid characteristics. He believed that on those occasions when he was admitted to psychiatric hospitals he was suffering from a stress-related episode of paranoid illness. He thought that at the time of the killings the offender was possibly in a psychotic depressive episode with delusions in relation to the safety of the children. Dr Carne was unavailable to give evidence at the trial. However, I do not accept that the offender was suffering from a psychotic state at the time of the killings although I do accept he was deeply mentally disturbed. 
     
      
    61 Dr Westmore, who examined the offender on a number of occasions, diagnosed him as suffering from a severe personality disorder of a mixed type with borderline narcissistic and immature traits. He described the offender as a deeply disturbed man with a profoundly troubled personality. The doctor formed the opinion that, although the offender knew it was legally wrong to kill the children, he was unable to appreciate it in a moral sense. Although the doctor accepted that the offender might have taken drugs to allow him to overcome his repugnance to killing the children, he did not believe that this meant that the offender appreciated the moral wrongfulness of what he was doing. 
     
      
    62 Dr Skinner gave evidence for the Crown. She made a similar diagnosis to Dr Westmore but parted company with him on the question of the capacity of the offender to understand the moral wrongfulness of his actions. To that extent Dr Skinner, while believing that the offender was deeply disturbed at the time of the killing, came to the view that he did not fall within the defence under s 23A. I should note that Dr Skinner changed her opinion in that regard having initially given the Crown advice that the offender did have a defence under the section. I found her reasons for the change in her opinion unconvincing. Nor was she aware of all of the facts surrounding the killings at the time of her second report. 
     
      
    63 Although by law and in a moral sense he has to be sentenced on the basis of wilful murder of the three children, his culpability is reduced by reason of his mental state at the time. He is not a danger to the community in general unless he enters into an unstable relationship in which there are young children. Given the length of time he will be required to serve before being eligible for release, it is very unlikely that he will find himself in such a situation. I accept Dr Westmore’s assessment that he presents more of a risk to himself than to any other person. 
     
      
    64 The Crown has submitted that general deterrence is of particular importance because of the fact that the offender intended by his acts to punish his wife as a result of the breakdown in his relationship. If that were the only motive or purpose behind the killing of the children, I would agree with the submission. But general deterrence would always be an important consideration where a person unlawfully takes the life of another on the basis that it was in that person’s best interest, however and for whatever reason that belief arises. The question in the present case is, to what degree, if at all, should the sentences reflect general deterrence. 
     
      
    65 It is a well-established principle of sentencing that an offender suffering from a severe mental disorder is not usually an appropriate subject for the expression of general deterrence to the same degree as a person without such a disorder. This does not mean that a sentence cannot reflect general deterrence where the offender is suffering from some mental abnormality. In a case where, as here, at the time of the commission of the crimes, the offender was aware of what he was doing, appreciated that it was unlawful, and understood the gravity of what he was doing, then the moderation of the weight to be given to general deterrence need not be great. 
     
      
    66 It should be apparent then that the Crown’s concession in relation to the inappropriateness of a life sentence was not only fair but also completely justified. A Crown Prosecutor fulfilling his duty to the Court could not have submitted otherwise. However, the overall sentence must be a very lengthy one and this fact was acknowledged by both the Crown and Mr Stratton SC who appeared for the offender. I have previously indicated that there were aggravating features in the commission of these killings that must be reflected in the sentence. The court is under a duty to denounce the killing of these children and must exact appropriate retribution for their loss of life. The offences are so serious in their objective facts that the diminution in his culpability by reason of his mental state is reflected largely in withholding the maximum sentence available and which would otherwise be appropriate. Although he is not to be sentenced to life imprisonment, the sentence must nevertheless be a very heavy one. 
     
      
    67 The offender will no doubt spend the substantial part, if not all, of his sentence in protection. He is at risk of prisoners taking it upon themselves to punish the offender for his crimes regardless of their lack of moral or legal right to do so. Although the offender requested that he be subject to a Limited Association Order and, therefore, finds himself in protection at his own request, it is not difficult to understand why he did so. As a result of the offender’s protected status, he receives only one hour out of his cell each day. Thus prison will be harsher for the offender than most other inmates and some allowance must be made for this fact. 
     
      
    68 I have been referred to a number of cases of multiple killings of family members. Each case of course is different and there are various considerations that lead to the exercise of a discretion in any particular case. But these cases indicate the range of sentences that have been imposed for somewhat comparable cases where the court believes that a life sentence is not warranted. In the present case on the basis of those sentences, Mr Stratton submitted that I could impose a non-parole period of no more than 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    69 However, statistical information of that kind is relevant mainly to achieve consistency in sentencing. It is a check upon an egocentric view of a particular crime by a particular judge or judges. But each sentencing judge has a discretion that should not be unduly curtailed by having regard to what sentences have been imposed in other cases. In particular the sentencer should not consider the most severe sentence that has been imposed for a particular type of offence or in respect of a particular kind of factual situation as in effect the maximum sentence that can be imposed for a similar type of offence or in respect of a similar factual situation. The most severe sentence imposed by some other court for a somewhat similar offence or factual scenario cannot constrain or limit a particular exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    70 It has been held that the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature is the first initial consideration in the sentencing exercise; R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174; R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253. The penalty fixed by the statute reflects the policy of Parliament and the general seriousness with which the community regards such an offence. Its importance cannot be replaced or displaced by the sentences actually being imposed by the courts. 
     
      
    71 However having formed my view of the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the offender after taking into account the various relevant factors, including the maximum penalty, I have considered how that sentence stands alongside other sentences imposed for similar offences or in similar factual scenarios with a view to determining whether the sentence is so far out of the range of sentences passed that it offends against the important policy of consistency in sentencing. 
     
      
    72 In particular I have had regard to the sentences imposed upon Mrs Folbigg but found them to be of little assistance because of the very peculiar facts in that case. The fact that she received a sentence of 40 years for offences against her five children, does not require me to impose a comparable sentence upon the offender whether or not I personally agree with the sentence imposed by Mr Justice Barr. Individual sentences do not form some benchmark against which some other sentence is to be evaluated. Certainly there is no mathematical equation that can be applied to indicate what sentence should be imposed upon a particular offender by reason of a sentence imposed upon some other offender or offenders. As I have indicated, in my opinion the only benchmark is the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament and it is against that figure that a particular sentence is to be measured having regard to all the relevant facts and the sentencing principles to be applied. 
     
      
    73 However, a review of those sentences indicates that the range is between 22 and 28 years head sentence. In some of those cases there was no evidence of any mental disorder present to reduce the offender’s culpability. The most similar is probably R v Cheatham [2002] NSWCCA 360 where the offender killed his wife, one of his children aged 3 and attempted to kill his other child, a baby. He was acting from a delusion that he had AIDS and was planning to commit suicide after killing his family. He believed it was in the interests of his family to kill them so that they would not suffer from the AIDS virus. He was required to spend his sentence in protection. He was sentenced, on appeal, to 22 years with a non-parole period of 14 years. 
     
      
    74 I am of the view that the present offences are considerably more serious than those for which Cheatham was sentenced. The present facts have a number of aggravating features not apparently present in that case. The offender is to be sentenced for the premeditated death of three children who died in circumstances in which they would have been aware of what was happening and struggled against their father in a vain hope to live. There is also the feature that the killings were in part intended to punish his wife in a most dreadful way. In my assessment the culpability of the offender is substantially more than Cheatham. In any event the sentence I am about to impose is what I believe to be the appropriate sentence although I have had regard to the other sentences to which I have been referred. 
     
      
    75 The wife of the prisoner presented a moving address to the Court by way of a victim impact statement. It is difficult to conceive of the anguish and pain that the mother of these children has suffered as a result of the actions of the offender. Clearly she feels guilt although there is not the slightest reason why she should. Nothing she did was responsible for the conduct of the offender and there was no reason why she should have behaved any differently than she did. It was the offender’s abnormal reaction to her behaviour that resulted in the death of the children. He simply was not going to allow her to make decisions affecting her and the children, if they did not accord with what he wanted. Of course the Court cannot use her loss and the effect upon her life of his actions to aggravate the offender’s criminality or to increase the punishment to be imposed upon him. The material was not received for this purpose. But it allowed the mother, as a victim of his crimes, to publicly state the effect of these crimes upon her, and to do so in the hearing of the offender. 
     
      
    76 Although the three killings occurred as part of the same criminal activity there should be some cumulation of the sentences. This is simply because the criminality involved in the killing of the three children cannot be expressed by a sentence relating to the killing of any one of them. The sentence has been reduced by reason of the offender’s diminished criminal responsibility as a result of his mental condition and because of the fact that he will serve his sentence in protected and restricted custody arrangements. For substantially those reasons the prisoner is not going to be sentenced to life imprisonment. The sentence in respect of Ashley is greater than with the two boys because of the assaults and injuries committed upon her. However, it is the overall sentence that is of primary importance in ensuring that the totality of the offender’s criminality is reflected in an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    77 There is nothing that would require that the non-parole period should be reduced by reason of special circumstances. The simple fact is that the prisoner’s sentence must be very severe and there is nothing that indicates to me that a lengthy period on parole is necessary other than to assist him reintegrate into the community after such a long period in custody. I have taken the nature of his custody into account generally in fixing the total sentence and I see no reason in this case to take it into account again in reducing the non-parole period.  
     
      
    78 The non-parole period will exceed that which would follow from an application of the statutory formula. This is because the non-parole period I am going to impose is in my opinion the absolute minimum that the prisoner must serve as punishment for his crimes. Nothing less will serve to denounce his conduct and serve as appropriate retribution for taking the lives of these three children in the way that he did. I appreciate that many in the community would believe that nothing less than life imprisonment would be appropriate for what the offender did. But with respect to those who hold that opinion, the proper measure of punishment must reflect an objective assessment of the offender’s culpability having regard to his mental state at the time of the killings. 
     
      
    79 On the first count of murder relating to the child Ryan the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 23 years from 21 August 2001 to expire on 20 August 2024. On the second count of murder relating to the child Jarrod the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 23 years to commence from 21 August 2005 and to expire on 20 August 2028. I have imposed fixed terms because of the sentence that I am about to impose which will provide a non-parole period. On the third count of murder relating to the child Ashley the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 25 years to commence on 21 August 2008. There is to be a non-parole of 20 years to expire on 20 August 2028 the date upon which the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    80 I intend by the sentences I have pronounced that the offender is to serve a total sentence of 32 years from 21 August 2001 with a minimum term of imprisonment of 27 years from that date. Whether he is released on the day the non-parole period expires will of course be a matter for the Parole Board.

     JANINE MORRIS v JACK NORMAN HANLEY & 10 ORS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MEAGHER JA: The Court is now in a position to give judgment. I will ask Ipp JA to give the first judgment.  
     
      
    2 IPP JA: Before dealing with the issues raised by this appeal, I think it appropriate to refer to some of the difficulties that occurred during the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    3 The appellant is not represented and while she struggled valiantly with the task before her, it was plainly too much for her to carry out properly. There are some twelve volumes of evidence, the pleadings are complex, the grounds of appeal not properly identified and this was not the kind of matter that an unrepresented litigant could present to the Court with any facility. 
     
      
    4 The appellant was assisted by her husband and brother-in-law and this compounded rather than alleviated the difficulties. During much of the argument, discussion took place between the persons assisting the appellant and the appellant. Often she simply repeated what she was told, apparently not always understanding what was said. There were long pauses between questions and answers and generally this method of presenting the argument made the task of the Court far more difficult than it otherwise would have been. 
     
      
    5 There were other difficulties in the case. 
     
      
    6 On 29 July 2003 the appellant filed her submissions of forty six pages. On 31 July 2003 the registrar gave directions including granting the appellant leave to amend her submissions by expanding upon any point raised and including references to the appropriate pages of the blue and black books. The registrar also ordered that the appellant’s amended submissions be filed by 31 October 2003. 
     
      
    7 The appellant did not comply with these directions and in January this year filed two books of written submissions, amounting to some 467 pages. They arrived too late for the respondent’s counsel to consider them and in the course of the hearing this morning the Court pointed out to the appellant that the appeal could not proceed on the basis of the new written argument, therefore it was for the appellant to choose whether to proceed on the original written submissions or seek an adjournment and pay costs. She chose to proceed on the original submissions. 
     
      
    8 I would add that the need to include references to the appropriate pages of the blue and black books was an important matter, as the original submissions of the appellant omitted any of these references, again making it extremely difficult for the Court to know whether she was making assertions or submissions or relying on evidence and, if she was relying on evidence, where that evidence was. 
     
      
    9 A further matter compounding the difficulties is the notice of appeal. The case proceeded on a document called a further amended notice of appeal. This contained eleven grounds of appeal. These basically were bald assertions. None properly described the true errors said to have been made by the judge. All were in very general terms. There is every prospect that had the respondent applied to have the notice of appeal struck out the application would have succeeded but the respondent did not so apply. 
     
      
    10 Thus, the Court was faced with an unrepresented litigant who had extreme difficulty in appreciating and coming to terms with the issues, written arguments which did not refer to the evidence and a notice of appeal which did not identify the issues. Nevertheless, from my reading of the material, I consider that the appeal is in fact hopeless. I propose to set out now the reasons for this conclusion. 
     
      
    11 Before doing that, I should note that the appellant asked leave to put in a further written submission after the oral argument had concluded. In my opinion this should be refused. The appellant has had ample time, several months indeed, to put her argument properly before the Court. This litigation has to come to an end. Moreover, in my view, on the material and the way in which the case has been presented, I do not see any basis on which a further written argument would assist. 
     
      
    12 I shall set out briefly the relevant facts which gave rise to the appellant’s claim. 
     
      
    13 The appellant and the first ten respondents were shareholders of the eleventh respondent, to which the trial judge referred as the company and I shall do the same. For some years before November 1987 the company conducted a business of manufacturing beef jerky. This business had been conducted since 1977 by the Mariani family. As at November 1987 the first eight respondents were permanent employees of the company. The first respondent Hanley was the accountant and the second respondent, Reid, was the general manager. Cecil Bellchambers, the tenth respondent, was the father of the ninth respondent, Gail Hanley. Gail Hanley became an employee of the company in 1988 as did Bellchambers. 
     
      
    14 In November 1987 a group of the employees of the company discussed putting together an offer to purchase the company. Certain information concerning the Worker Enterprise Corporation, to which I shall refer as WEC, came to their attention. WEC was an organisation set up by the New South Wales Government to foster the conduct of small businesses on what were called workers’ co-operative principles. WEC had at its disposal funds which could be lent to foster the setting up or development of businesses of this type. 
     
      
    15 Negotiations ensued between the company and WEC and on 13 May 1988 a deed of loan between WEC and the company was entered into. The deed of loan related to a fully drawn advance of $250,000 for the purchase of the business and the real estate on which the business was conducted. The term of the loan was to be six years. The deed of loan contained the following provisions: 
     
      
       
        
        “11. The Borrower shall at all times during the currency of the loan conduct its operations in accordance strictly with accepted principles of worker co-operation and shall comply in all respects with any directions which may be given in this regard by WEC to the Borrower from time to time. 
        
       
       
        
        12. Where the Borrower is a company at the date hereof then at the direction of WEC given at any time during the currency of the loan: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the borrower shall without delay and at its expense cause to be made and registered such changes to its Memorandum and Articles of Association as WEC may require for establishing the Borrower as a worker co-operative company and shall not otherwise permit any changes to be made to its Memorandum and Articles of Association without first obtaining the express written consent of WEC thereto. …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 Also on 13 May 1988, a general meeting of the company took place and special resolutions were passed for the alteration of the articles to a form which had been agreed with WEC. I shall refer to these articles as the 1988 articles. All ten members of the company were present and consented to the resolutions. 
     
      
    17 The 1988 articles contained the following provisions: 
     
      
       
        
        “9. Except for founder members and holders of A or B class shares: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Every member shall hold at least one hundred (100) shares. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Every member shall be an employee of the company. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) Except in the circumstances set out in articles 15(a) and 16 every employee of the company shall be a member. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        10. … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The board shall accept any application for shares required to admit to membership an employee who has completed six months employment with the company, and may accept such an application from an employee who has completed less than six months such employment. Providing that if the board has determined, no later than the date of considering the application, to terminate the person’s employment, it shall not accept the application for membership. The board may at its discretion refuse any application for shares additional to the minimum shareholding established in article 9(a) herein. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        15. … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The company shall enter into a written contract of employment with every permanent employee other than an indentured apprentice in or to the effect of the form set out below:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        16. … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the employment of any person who is a member of the company shall be immediately terminated if that person ceases to be a member for any reason other than as a consequence of either the bankruptcy of that person or because that person has entered into an agreement with his or her creditors in accordance with Part X of the Bankruptcy Act (1966) (which agreement is in this article called a Part X Agreement).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 On 13 May 1988 each of the first ten respondents was issued with 10,000 ordinary shares; 46,000 A class shares were issued to Bellchambers, who had made an additional investment of $46,000. 
     
      
    19 A management buy-out of the company was effected on 31 May 1988. 
     
      
    20 The company needed funds and unsuccessfully sought a loan from a commercial bank. WEC, however on 1 July 1988, promised the company $350,000 by way of loan finance and implemented this promise pursuant to a deed of loan. On 1 July 1988 an institution described as NSWIC advanced the company a further $360,000. 
     
      
    21 Later both NSWIC and WEC transferred their businesses to the Australian Association of Co-operatives Limited, known as AAC. 
     
      
    22 At about this time one Mr Rogers was appointed a director of the company. Thereafter, the Board consisted of the first, second and eighth respondents, (Messrs Hanley, Reid and Mrs Armfield) and Mr Rogers. 
     
      
    23 On 12 March 1990 AAC wrote to Reid, stating that the company had failed to comply with the spirit of the agreement of which the deed of loan (pursuant to which WEC had lent $350,000 to the company) was a part. This led to the company deciding to pay back the loans to the AAC. A loan was raised from the Commonwealth Development Bank and, by the end of September 1990, the borrowings that had been made from WEC and NSWIC and which were owed to AAC were paid out. 
     
      
    24 After the loans had been so paid and AAC shares redeemed, the company on 5 March 1992, by special resolution, replaced the 1988 articles with articles in conventional form (“the 1992 articles”). The special classes of shares were distributed equally among the ten shareholders and became ordinary shares. 
     
      
    25 The appellant had become an permanent employee of the company on 1 June 1988. In mid 1994 she and her husband became shareholders in the company and from that time on received additional benefits in the company equivalent to those received by other shareholders. 
     
      
    26 In 1995 she first became aware of the deed of loan and the terms of the 1992 articles and in 1996 she made a claim against the company. She claimed that the first ten respondents as members of the company had owed her fiduciary duties which they had breached. She claimed also that the second, third and eighth respondents, as directors of the company, also owed her fiduciary duties which they had breached. She further alleged that the first ten respondents were guilty of a conspiracy against her which caused her damage and finally she contended that the company owed her a duty of care which it had breached. 
     
      
    27 Hamilton J dismissed these claims and the appeal to this Court today is from his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    28 I have already commented on the notice of appeal and I will turn to that later in these reasons but it is really of little help in defining the issues that have been raised. 
     
      
    29 It is worthwhile I think trying to encapsulate the appellant’s basic complaint. She contends in effect that because she became a permanent employee of the company on 1 June 1988 she in some way became entitled to the benefits provided to employees by the 1988 articles. She also contends that she is also entitled to the benefits which she contended were available to her pursuant to the deed of loan, that is between WEC and the company. 
     
      
    30 The principal benefits concerned were rights to certain shares to which, by the 1988 articles, permanent employees of the company were to become entitled. It is worthwhile pointing out at this stage that under those articles the number of shares involved was only one hundred. Nevertheless, the basis of the appellant’s claim is that like other shareholders she would have been given 10,000. 
     
      
    31 The appellant advances these contentions even though she only became a shareholder in 1994 when she agreed to do so on the basis of the 1992 articles. She did not know until 1995, as I have mentioned, of the deed of loan or the 1988 articles. Thus she was content to be employed, that is until she learnt the truth about the articles and the deed of loan, on the terms she had then agreed upon. The appellant complains that the respondents concealed from her the terms of the loan and the 1988 articles. She contends basically that she is entitled to be treated as the other ten respondents were treated as shareholders during the period that she was not a shareholder but only a permanent employee. 
     
      
    32 Presenting the case in this way, serious difficulties arise. The first difficulty is the allegation that there was a fiduciary relationship between the appellant and the first ten respondents as shareholders. Throughout the argument, both written and oral, there has been no attempt to define the fiduciary duty which is said to have arisen. The appellant has equated a fiduciary relationship with a fiduciary duty without ever attempting to define or describe the extent of the duty. Of course, the fact that a fiduciary relationship exists does not mean that every single possible fiduciary duty known to the law arises. It has never been made clear what particular fiduciary duty is said to have been breached but I shall now deal with the question of a fiduciary relationship between the appellant and the first ten respondents as shareholders. 
     
      
    33 Hamilton J noted that, according to the respondents at least, the central plank of the case against them was knowledge, that is knowledge of the relevant terms of the deed of loan and the 1988 articles. The judge in this regard found that the requisite knowledge on the part of the first ten respondents as shareholders had not been established. This was challenged in the appeal. 
     
      
    34 The argument was presented without any proper consideration of the principles relating to a challenge to factual findings on appeal. Fox v Percy (2003) 197 ALR at 201 and the other well known authorities indicate that an appellant may establish that a trial judge’s factual findings are erroneous where that is demonstrated by incontrovertible facts or uncontested testimony or in quite rare cases where the decision is simply glaringly improbable, or contrary to compelling inferences, or where it is otherwise shown that the trial judge failed to use or misused his or her advantage of hearing or seeing the witnesses. The High Court in Fox v Percy has pointed out that an appellate court must be concerned as to whether the trial judge has too readily drawn conclusions about truthfulness and reliability solely or mainly from the appearance of witnesses and their demeanour and in carrying out this exercise the appellate court should examine contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events. 
     
      
    35 In some instances the appellant submitted that contemporary materials demonstrated that his Honour was wrong. These materials were letters that had been written in which reference was made either to the deed of loan or to the 1988 articles. The appellant pointed out that there was some suggestion in the evidence that one or more of the first ten respondents had seen the letters or had been at meetings to which the letters referred where the loan and the articles were discussed. 
     
      
    36 The witnesses concerned had given oral evidence that they did not know of the existence of the specific terms of the 1988 articles and his Honour believed them. 
     
      
    37 The documentary evidence relied on by the appellant is not particularly specific and is open to the construction that, while one or other or all of the first ten respondents may have been at meetings where these matters were discussed, no specific reference was made to the 1988 articles. In my view it was open to his Honour to come to the factual finding that he did and I do not think that he erred in this respect. On this basis, the knowledge on which the appellant relied to establish the existence of a fiduciary relationship was not proved. 
     
      
    38 There was another ground on which his Honour concluded that no fiduciary relationship as alleged arose. This was on the basis that, for such a duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the ten shareholders had such control over the subject matter of the relevant articles that the imposition of such a duty was justified. His Honour pointed out that it was not possible to conclude on the evidence that the shareholders took decisions that bound the directors as to the governance or management of the company and there was no evidence that at meetings referred to by the appellant the shareholders had taken decisions that were intended to or which in fact dictated or governed what was done by the directors. In my view the proposition embraced by the judge in this regard is unexceptionable. 
     
      
    39 There are other matters which militate against the existence of any such fiduciary relationship. 
     
      
    40 Only four of the respondents, Hanley, Reid, Boyd and Cole, were arguably negotiating with WEC and the reality – as the respondents submit – was that Hanley alone did the negotiating. None of these four purported to represent all employees. 
     
      
    41 Further, there is nothing in the surrounding circumstances that suggest that a fiduciary relationship between the shareholders and the appellant arose. 
     
      
    42 I should mention in this latter respect that the appellant argued that the fiduciary relationship stemmed from the fact that WEC made the loan as a trustee. But the funds lent were not impressed with any trust and there was nothing to suggest that they were lent on any trust. The funds were simply lent as part of a commercial transaction subject to specific conditions. The imposition of conditions does not transform, merely by their existence, a commercial loan into a loan on trust. 
     
      
    43 The appellant also in her oral submissions sought to rely in some way which I found difficult to understand on Trident General Insurance Co. Ltd v McNiece Bros. Pty Ltd (1988) 165 CLR 107. Trident did not concern fiduciary relationships. I would add that a cause of action on this ground was not pleaded, nor was it the subject of the notice of appeal or the written submissions. In my view, the appellant should not be permitted to raise this argument. 
     
      
    44 To summarise on this issue, I consider that his Honour was justified in concluding that no fiduciary relationship existed. 
     
      
    45 I next turn to the cause of action based on the allegation of conspiracy on the part of the first ten respondents. His Honour set out the elements of the tort of conspiracy, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) to effect an unlawful purpose; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) to effect a purpose which is lawful by unlawful means; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) to effect a purpose which is lawful by lawful means but for the predominant purpose of doing harm to another 
        
       
       
        
        and in the carrying out of that agreement or combination damage is caused to another.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour said further that in order to establish the conspiracy there had to be proved an agreement amongst the alleged conspirators to do an unlawful fact and proof of actual intent to injure the plaintiff, or alternatively although the agreement was not to do an unlawful act, the conspirators’ predominant purpose was to harm the plaintiff. 
       
      
    46 The appellant submitted that his Honour was wrong in his exposition but McWilliam v Penthouse Publications Limited (2001) NSWCA 237 is ample authority for the propositions of law expressed by his Honour. 
     
      
    47 His Honour held as a matter of fact that nothing had been said by the relevant parties or done by them to amount to agreements to conspire of the kind alleged by the appellants. These are factual findings made by his Honour and they have not been shown to have been wrong. 
     
      
    48 His Honour found that he was unable to hold that any of the first ten respondents had any intention to harm the appellant. He found that many of the respondents did not think of the appellant at all at any material time. He pointed out that the most that was conceded was some awareness that if a certain course was followed the appellant would not come to share in certain benefits. This he held did not constitute a relevant intention to harm. In my view he was entirely correct in this regard. 
     
      
    49 As part of her submissions in regard to conspiracy the appellant complained, and I should say complained over and over again, that his Honour incorrectly found that in 1987 the company was showing losses of about $1000 per day. As I understood the submission, it was that the company in fact was profitable and the respondents represented to her that it was not profitable with a view to persuading her not to apply for shares in the company.  
     
      
    50 The first point to make is that the finding by his Honour is simply part of an historical narrative when he explains why the previous owners of the company wished to dispose of the business. 
     
      
    51 The second point is that the case based on these misrepresentations was not pleaded, it was not run at trial, it is not part of the notice of appeal. 
     
      
    52 Thirdly, there is in my view ample evidence on which his Honour could have relied for the statement of lack of profitability. Bodycote testified that the company was known to have been losing money (blue appeal book at 237) and the company was having serious financial difficulties (blue book 238). He was not cross-examined about these matters. Hanley said the business was losing $1000 per day (blue appeal book 244.3), and the company was making losses (247). It was not suggested to him this evidence was false. Reid testified the company had struggled financially from 1980 to 1987, and gave examples of shortages of money (blue appeal book 324.6). It would be tedious to go through all the other evidence. It is sufficient to say on the authority of Fox v Percy this point fails. When I say authority, I mean on the approach that appeal courts must adopt when factual issues are raised. 
     
      
    53 Accordingly, in my view the case on conspiracy fails. 
     
      
    54 Next is the argument that the company itself owed a fiduciary duty to the appellant. Again, the fundamental problem of a failure to identify the nature and extent and scope of the fiduciary duty remains. We are not told what this fiduciary duty is. The case is simply put on the basis that there was a fiduciary relationship. 
     
      
    55 Hamilton J found that there was no fiduciary relationship. He referred to the fact that the contractual arrangements that were entered into were commercial, at arm’s length, and the appellant was not a party to any of the relevant transactions. The transaction was essentially a matter of contract and his Honour said that he could not infer that the company by entering into the transaction could be taken as making an undertaking or giving a pledge in favour of the appellant or other persons who might become permanent employees such as would give rise to a fiduciary relationship. 
     
      
    56 I am in entire agreement with his Honour. Again I leave in the air, as the appellant did, the nature and extent of whatever fiduciary duty she contended for. 
     
      
    57 Then there is the contention that there existed a duty of care on the part of the company. This is perhaps the most hopeless of all the arguments raised. As Hamilton J said, the imposition of a duty of care on a company to conduct its affairs in accordance with its articles, which it owed to a person not a member, or to inform persons who are not members of the contents of the articles, would be a novelty without basis in authority or principle. 
     
      
    58 The case against the directors based on a duty of care fails on the same grounds as does the case against the company. Just as the nature of the relationship between the company and the appellant is not of any special kind, and is simply a commercial relationship, so is the relationship between the directors and the appellant. Again, there remains the ever present problem of the nature and the extent of the fiduciary duty contended for. 
     
      
    59 Those were basically the grounds on which the appellant relied which I can distil from the broad mass of submissions that were made. 
     
      
    60 I turn however finally to the actual notice of appeal. 
     
      
    61 The first four grounds all raise the contention of error on the part of the judge in not finding fiduciary relationships. I have dealt with those. 
     
      
    62 The fifth ground is that his Honour erred in giving judgment for the respondents and reaching a result which is plainly unreasonable and unjust. This is not an appropriate ground of appeal and I do not propose to address it. It is not open in law simply to assert a proposition in these terms and hope that the appellate tribunal will search through the papers in an attempt to find an appropriate ground of appeal. 
     
      
    63 Next is ground six which is that his Honour erred in making decisions on facts which cannot be supported by the evidence. I have dealt largely with these matters in the course of my reasons so far and I do not propose to go further. Two of the main points made by the appellant in this regard involved complaints against her own counsel. In my view, these are entirely without substance. 
     
      
    64 According to ground seven, his Honour erred in his decision on the credibility of the respondents. Again I think it unnecessary to deal further with this. I have explained why in my view his Honour was entitled to come to the decision that he did. It was plainly based on an examination of particular evidence that had been given by the witnesses to which he referred, on evidence given by the appellant herself, and on the demeanour of the witnesses concerned. In my view, his Honour made the decision in my view entirely in accordance with the duty imposed on him as trial judge. 
     
      
    65 Ground eight relates to findings of law. The only one raised in the argument is that with which I have already dealt, namely relating to the elements of conspiracy. 
     
      
    66 It is said in ground nine that his Honour erred in his interpretation of the appellant’s statement of claim. This concerns the allegation in para 14 of the statement of claim: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, or in the alternative, each of the first to tenth defendants in combination with each other and/or each of them thereby entered into an agreement...” 
        
       
       
      It was said by the appellant that this meant not only that the conspiracy was arrived at by all ten of the respondents but by any number of them. Irrespective of whether the statement of claim is open to this construction, which I doubt, this argument was not put at trial and it is apparent from the written submissions filed by then counsel for the appellant that no case in this regard was put to the trial judge. In my view it cannot now be raised on appeal. 
       
      
    67 The last two grounds are that the defendant’s failure to comply with the Supreme Court Rules affected the plaintiff’s ability to plead her case, and that reasons were not given for not finding a fiduciary duty. The first of these grounds has never been properly explained and I can see no reason how the defendant’s failure to comply with the Supreme Court Rules had any effect on the appellant. As to the second, His Honour gave ample reasons for not finding a fiduciary duty. 
     
      
    68 Accordingly, in my view the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
    69 MEAGHER JA: I agree. 
     
      
    70 SHELLER JA: I also agree. 
     
      
    71 MEAGHER JA: The order of the Court therefore is the appeal is dismissed with costs.

     HARRISON v LAU NAY NOMINEES PTY LIMITED & Ors 
     
     
      
    FACTS:The appellant was born in 1945, had been driving trucks and loading and unloading semi-trailers since 1963, and worked as a truck driver for the first respondent since 1991.On Friday 19 November 1999 the appellant set out from the first respondent’s Chipping Norton depot, where he picked up his semi-trailer, a prime mover with one pre-loaded trailer attached, to take to Melbourne. The appellant had been directed to pick up a second trailer pre-loaded with large crates of extruded aluminium from the second respondent’s premises in Penrith. The second trailer was not completely full. The appellant allegedly complained about this to the second respondent, and was told in reply that they he would not receive any assistance in this regard. The appellant was also directed to make another (third) pick-up for the trip to Melbourne, of a ‘grader blade’ from Cooks Construction Pty Limited (the third defendant in the District Court proceedings), in Sutton. The appellant reached the Sutton address on Saturday 20 November 1999, to find the grader blade hanging on a crane sling, ready to be loaded into the second trailer by crane operated by an attendant: “Bob”, however, some of the crates in the second trailer had moved around and fallen. The grader wouldn’t fit properly into the second trailer until the crates had been rearranged, and the appellant asked Bob for such assistance, to use the crane to redistribute the trailer’s existing load of crates, before loading the grader onto it. Bob (the attendant) refused to unload the crane sling, so the appellant then asked Bob to help him lift and push the crates into alignment, which Bob agreed to help him do. Whilst the appellant and Bob lifted one such crate (weighing 164 kilograms) back up onto its position above head-height (leaving the other two crates which had fallen or moved on the trailer floor), the appellant apparently injured his lower back whilst turning his trunk during the heavy lifting.THE DECISION:AGAINST THE FIRST RESPONDENT (unanimous):The employer / first respondent is not liable for an employee’s injury for the single reason of being the employer: Pro-Krane Pty Ltd v Nobbs (Nov 1996, BC 9605515) (per Cole JA, Mahoney and Handley JJA concurring) applied; appeal against the first respondent dismissed with costs.AGAINST THE SECOND RESPONDENTPer Ipp JA (McColl JA concurring): Although the second respondent stacked the trailer carelessly, it does not follow that this constituted a breach of duty on the part of the second respondent that caused the appellant to suffer damage. The appellant acknowledged that it was his own responsibility to ensure the load was properly positioned and secured, and, despite complaining, failed to instigate any action with the second respondent at the time and place where the loading was carried out. Further, the second respondent did not know (and could not have reasonably foreseen) that another party would require the appellant to load additional materials into the second trailer for the same trip. The appellant had many years experience in loading and unloading these types of trucking trailers, and was fully aware that a crate weighing in excess of 160 kilograms would require particular care and mechanical strength, and the trial judge found that the appellant was foolhardy to try to lift it. The trial judge also found that the second respondent could not have foreseen that the appellant would act with such extreme disregard for his own safety. These two points are affirmed on appeal. Meagher JA (in dissent): As the second respondent loaded the second trailer carelessly, a reasonable person in the second respondent’s situation must have known that such negligently-packed crates have a tendency to collapse, causing unknown damage, and requiring a re-arrangement of the heavy crates to take place. It was in trying to complete such a re-arrangement that the plaintiff was injured. By majority (2:1): Appeal dismissed against the second respondent with costs.DECISION: 1. Appeal against first respondent dismissed with costs (3:0). 2. Appeal against second respondent, by majority, dismissed with costs (2:1).IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOURT OF APPEAL

     HARRISON v LAU NAY NOMINEES PTY LIMITED & Ors 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MEAGHER JA: On Saturday 20 November 1999 Mr John Harrison was injured whilst lifting a heavy object on the back of a truck at a roadside construction camp at Sutton, near Canberra. 
     
      
    2 Mr Harrison lives in Melbourne, and was employed by Lau Nay Nominees Pty Ltd (t/as ABS Transport), a transport company whose business was controlled from headquarters in Melbourne, but had a Sydney depot at Chipping Norton near Liverpool. Chipping Norton was often the commencement point for his trips (to Melbourne, or where ever). So it was on the evening on 19 November, when he set out from Chipping Norton to go to Melbourne via Penrith. When he set out his semi-trailer comprised the prime mover and one trailer. That trailer had been pre-loaded for him. The cargo comprised general freight, covered with a tarpaulin. 
     
      
    3 He arrived at his Penrith destination at about 10.00 pm that evening. There he collected a second trailer pre-loaded with large crates of extruded aluminium. The Penrith premises were owned by Crane Enfield Metals Pty Ltd. 
     
      
    4 The pre-loading was, apparently, not done in a satisfactory manner. There were not enough crates to fill the trailer, with the result that there were gaps between crates. One gap was on the passenger side, and another in the middle of the trailer. Mr Harrison was of the view that to leave the gap on the passenger side was a bit dangerous, and it would have been better to have the gap on the driver’s side. Mr Harrison could have corrected this problem by a rearrangement of the straps that fastened the crates. Mr Harrison informed the officer of the Penrith factory that “he wasn’t happy” with the way the trailer had been loaded, predicting that “the crates would fall” and stating that he “had no way of securing them”. The man replied “Bad luck”. Mr Harrison said that he could have solved the problem of reworking the ropes and straps, but did not do so “probably because of fatigue”. 
     
      
    5 By the time he left Penrith he had discovered that there was another “pick-up” job for him at Sutton, near Canberra. Exactly when he made this discovery I cannot tell. Nor does it matter. But to Sutton he repaired. First he stopped at Narellan to check the load. He satisfied himself that it had not moved and continued on. At Goulburn he stopped to have a sleep. He slept in the cabin bunk in the prime mover. When he woke up he drove to the Sutton address: it was a roadside construction camp, operated by Cooks Construction Pty Limited. 
     
      
    6 There was waiting for him a grader blade to be transported to Melbourne. It was already on a crane sling ready to be loaded into the second trailer. Mr Harrison noticed that two or three of the crates on the driver’s side at the back of it had fallen into the packing in the gap on the passenger side of the trailer. There was an attendant present called “Bob”, whom Mr Harrison had never seen before. Mr Harrison asked Bob to take the grader blade off the crane sling and lift the fallen crates back into position on the back of the trailer, using the crane. Bob replied: “It’s 10 o’clock. My daughter is getting married at 2 o’clock and I haven’t got time.” He replied “Well I’ve got to move them” [sc. the crates]. “I can’t load the thing in there like that.” He then said to Bob “We’ll get on the end of that box and we’ll see if we can move it.” Mr Harrison pointed to a crate weighing 164 kilograms, the weight being printed on the outside of the crate. 
     
      
    7 Both men took hold of the crate, Mr Harrison lifting one end from floor level to above head level and then sideways. He was unable to step to the left because there was not enough room. He had to rotate his trunk. As he did so he felt discomfort in his lower back. The crate was put back into position. The other one or two crates which had fallen were left where they were. The diesel engine was also loaded onto the truck using the crane. Mr Harrison tied the tarpaulins back over the load on the trailer and set off to drive to Melbourne. 
     
      
    8 Immediately after he left Sutton Mr Harrison “knew that something had gone wrong” with his back. Within a day or so, that “something” had crystallized into a really serious injury. 
     
      
    9 Not surprisingly, he cast about for whom to sue. Eventually he sued his employer, its Penrith customer Crane Enfield Metals Pty Limited, and the Sutton contractor Cooks Construction Pty Ltd, as first second and third defendants respectively. Naughton DCJ found for all three defendants. Mr Harrison now appeals. The respondents are the first two defendants; the third defendant, against whom one might have thought Mr Harrison had some case, has escaped an appeal. 
     
      
    10 Learned senior counsel for the appellant Mr Harrison, Mr Petty SC, submitted that the first respondent, Mr Harrison’s employer, must be liable in negligence, apparently simply because he was an employer. The law has not yet got to this pass. The difficulty of acceding to this submission lies in trying to defile exactly what it was his employer was supposed to have done which it did not do or what it did which it should not have done. One must be able to point to some such feature before liability can exist. As Cole JA said in Pro-Krane Pty Ltd v Nobbs (Nov. 1996, BC 9605515), with the concurrence of Mahoney and Handley JJA: 
     
      
       
        
        “It does not follow, however, that simply because an employee is injured in the workplace there is a failure by an employer, by himself or an independent contractor, to provide a safe system of work.” 
        
       
      
    11 Mr Petty attempted to surmount this difficulty in a variety of ways. His principal attempt was to argue that the employer had attempted to delegate his non-delegable duty to provide a safe system of work by treating Mr Harrison as his “expert”. But this is to play with words. Mr Harrison gave evidence that he had from the age of 16 years worked either on or with trucks and had secured a truck driver’s licence by the age of 18. He said he had extensive experience in the loading and unloading of trucks and in the driving and transportation of fully loaded vehicles; and that it was because of his skill and experience that he sought and obtained employment with the first respondent. In these circumstances, there was no “delegation” of anything by his employer to him, but many a sensible recognition by his employer of his expertise. The situation in this case has nothing in common with the situation in McLean v Tedman (1984) 155 CLR 306 at 311, when his Honours Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ said: “It is not an acceptable answer to assert that an employee has no control over an employee’s negligence or inadvertence.” 
     
      
    12 As Mr Little SC, learned senior counsel for the first respondent, said: “This is not a case where it can be suggested that a safety officer travel to every site before the truck driver gets there to see that the loads are safe to pick up.” 
     
      
    13 Again, there was a submission about Mr Harrison’s use of a telephone. If one dispenses with a good deal of verbal confusion, what the evidence amounts to is clear enough: If Mr Harrison did not want to pick up a load, for any reason which seemed good to him, he could ring his employer’s head office and say so; if he did that, his employer would abide by his decision, despite any disappointment it might feel. That seems exactly what one would expect of any two rational beings. But there is no way one can torture that evidence into a statement that the employer created such an atmosphere of terror that Mr Harrison was frightened to disappoint them and was thereby driven to undertake tasks which his prudence suggested should be refused. 
     
      
    14 Finally, there was a submission, which I must say can hardly be taken seriously, that his employer should have given him warnings and lectures. Pray, one might ask, to what effect? Not to lift loads which are too heavy to lift? 
     
      
    15 I do not think the first beginnings of a case of negligence are made out against the first respondent. 
     
      
    16 As to the second respondent, I think things are different. It stacked the second trailer carelessly. It certainly did not know the plaintiff was going on to Sutton. It had no idea of what fate befell the plaintiff at that location. But a reasonable person in the second respondent’s situation must have known that negligently packed crates have a tendency to collapse, and that once there is a collapse a re-arrangement must take place. It was in trying to negotiate such a re-arrangement that the plaintiff was injured. 
     
      
    17 In my view, therefore, the following orders should be made: 
     
      
    i. Appeal allowed as to part;ii. Set aside the trial judge’s verdict and order in favour of the second defendant/respondent;iii. Dismiss appeal against first defendant/respondent with costs;iv. Enter verdict in favour of plaintiff against second defendant;v. Order a retrial of plaintiff’s action against second defendant, limited to quantum of damages;vi. Order second defendant to pay plaintiff’s costs of appealvii. Second respondent’s costs of trial to abide result of rehearing;viii. Second respondent to have a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act. 
     
      
    18 IPP JA: I agree with Meagher JA for the reasons that he has given that the appellant’s appeal against the first respondent should be dismissed. I do not agree, however, that the appeal against the second respondent should succeed and I set out my reasons for this conclusion below. 
     
      
    19 I accept that the second respondent stacked the second trailer carelessly. But it does not follow that this constituted a breach of duty on the part of the second respondent that caused the appellant to suffer damage. 
     
      
    20 The appellant agreed that it was his own responsibility to ensure that the load was properly positioned and properly secured. He was well aware of the defects with the stacking but other than complaining about this to the second respondent did nothing further. 
     
      
    21 The appellant agreed that there was an alternative method of securing the crates which he could have alone implemented and which “could have” worked. When asked why he had not secured the crates in accordance with this method the appellant answered “probably because of fatigue”. 
     
      
    22 There was no evidence to suggest that the second respondent should have known or foreseen that the appellant might not ensure, personally, the proper positioning and securing of the load. The case was not conducted on this basis.  
     
      
    23 The next relevant matter concerns the fact that the second respondent had arranged with the first respondent that the crates stacked by it (that is, the second respondent) would be delivered to Melbourne. The second respondent did not know that there was any prospect of the appellant taking on further cargo en route to Melbourne. The second respondent could not have foreseen this possibility. 
     
      
    24 The second respondent’s lack of knowledge about any possible extra load assumes importance when seen in the context of the trial judge’s finding that the defective loading of the crates by the second respondent presented no danger to the completion of the journey to Melbourne. The danger only arose when the appellant made the detour to Sutton and there attempted to reposition the crates so that he could take on board the grader blade and diesel engine. 
     
      
    25 The second respondent could not have foreseen that the appellant would go elsewhere to accept an additional load (which would mean that the crates would have to be moved) and that its own stacking of the crates (which did not otherwise constitute a danger) would thereby be converted into a potential source of harm to the appellant. This means that the scope of whatever duty of care was owed by the second respondent to the appellant did not extend to taking care to prevent the appellant from suffering harm to which the taking on of an additional load contributed. 
     
      
    26 The absence of the element of foreseeability also has serious implications for the appellant’s case on causation. There are, in addition, other matters that militate against a finding that a breach of any duty of care that the second respondent might have owed the appellant caused him harm.  
     
      
    27 The appellant was a man with many years of experience in transporting heavy goods. He knew that the crate that he attempted to lift was very heavy. It weighed 164 kilograms and this weight was printed on the outside. It must have been obvious to him that any attempt on his part to lift the crate manually was fraught with risk. The trial judge rightly found that it was foolhardy of the appellant to try to lift it.  
     
      
    28 The trial judge found that the second respondent could not have foreseen that the appellant would act with such extreme disregard for his own safety. In my view this finding cannot be challenged on the evidence. 
     
      
    29 It was not essential for the appellant to accept the load of the grader blade and diesel engine. In any event, he could have made appropriate arrangements with his employer, the first respondent, to move the crate by mechanical means. 
     
      
    30 Finally, in regard to this issue, the detour to Sutton, undertaken by the appellant, and his acceptance of the extra load, would not have caused any difficulty but for the fact that the daughter of the man “Bob” was getting married that day and this meant that the crane that was normally available to move loads such as the crate could not be operated. 
     
      
    31 The trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If one considers the plaintiff’s case against the second defendant as depending on causation rather than breach of duty of care the result is the same. On analysis relating to duty of care I find that there was no breach of duty of care owed by the second defendant to the plaintiff. I have found that the harm which occurred was not foreseeable by the second defendant. On analysis relating to causation I find that the manner in which the crates were initially loaded by, or on behalf of, the second defendant was not a material cause of the plaintiff’s injury. The poor initial loading of the crates lacked sufficient nexus with the plaintiff’s injury, or was too remote, to render the second defendant liable for it.” 
        
       
       
      In my view the trial judge was correct in these views. 
       
      
    32 I would dismiss the appeal against the second respondent with costs. 
     
      
    33 McCOLL JA: I agree with Ipp JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, notice of which contains these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “……. . that I desire to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a sentence pronounced by his Honour Judge Barnett, a judge of the District Court of New South Wales, at the Drug Court on 24 July 2003 when one William John TOMAN appeared for final sentence on charges numbered 1 to 9 hereunder and for sentence on charges numbered 10 and 11 hereunder to all of which charges he had pleaded guilty:

        4. break enter and steal 
         
        5. break enter and steal 
         
        6. escape lawful custody 
         
        7. break enter and steal

        10. break enter and steal 
         
        11. break enter and steal 
         
        
       
       
        
        AND 
         for the said offence he was sentenced as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        1. three years and eleven months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 22 May 2003. 
        
       
       
        
        2. three years and eleven months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 22 May 2003 
        
       
       
        
        3. three years and eleven months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 22 May 2003 
        
       
       
        
        4. three years and eleven months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 22 May 2003 
        
       
       
        
        5. three years and eleven months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 22 May 2003 
        
       
       
        
        6. six months imprisonment to date from 23 November 2003 
        
       
       
        
        7. eighteen months imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 22 May 2003 
        
       
       
        
        8. a fine of $100.00 
        
       
       
        
        9. a fine of $100.00 
        
       
       
        
        10. four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 22 May 2003. 
        
       
       
        
        11. four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months to date from 22 May 2003. 
        
       
       
        
        ON THE GROUND 
         that the said sentence is manifestly inadequate.” 
         
        
       
       
      THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
       
      
    2 The Court is constituted pursuant to s3 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the Act): 
     
      
       
        
        “3 (1) The Supreme Court shall for the purposes of this Act be the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the court shall be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct. “ 
        
       
      
    3 Provision in s6AA of the Act for the hearing of some appeals by two judges is not presently relevant. 
     
      
    4 The right of the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against sentence is vested by s5D(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “5D (1) The Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence pronounced by the court of trial in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party and the Court of Criminal Appeal may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper. “ 
        
       
      
    5 The Crown was a party to the proceedings against the respondent in the Drug Court. It was not suggested that this was not so. The Act has a specific provision relating to appeals from the Drug Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “5AF (1) Section 5AA applies to and in respect of a person convicted of an offence by the Drug Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Part 2 of the Drug Court Act 1998 (in relation only to a final sentence determined by the Court under section 12 of that Act) in the same way as it applies to a person referred to in section 5AA(1). 
        
       
       
        
         (2) For the purposes of this section, a reference in section 5AA to the Supreme Court is to be construed as including a reference to the Drug Court. 
        
       
       
        
         (3) The power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine an appeal under this section is to be exercised by such single judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct.” 
        
       
      
    6 Section 5AA is incorporated, as just set out, in s5AF by reference and it makes provision for appeals brought by persons who are convicted or against whom orders have been made. There is no reference in s5AA to appeals by the Crown (brought by the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions):  
     
      
       
        
        “5AA (1) A person 
        
       
       
        
         (a) convicted of an offence; or 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) against whom an order to pay any costs is made, by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction may appeal under this Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the conviction (including any sentence imposed) or order. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (2) For the purposes of this Act, a person acquitted on the ground of mental illness, where mental illness was not set up as a defence by the person, shall be deemed to be a person convicted, and any order to keep the person in custody shall be deemed to be a sentence.” 
        
       
      
    7 Neither Counsel appearing in the present appeal suggested that the Court should be constituted other than in accordance with s3, that is to say, by three judges. Their stance in that regard was correct.  
     
      
    8 The result of the statutory construct is that an appeal from the Drug Court by the prosecution will be heard by a bench of three judges whereas an appeal by an offender will be heard by a single judge as prescribed by s5AF(3).  
     
      
    9 The second reading speech upon the bill which became the Drug Court Act by the Hon R.D. Dyer on behalf of the Attorney General included these references to appeals: 
     
      
       
        
        “There will be no right of appeal from decisions of the Drug Court as to eligibility, treatment option, sanctions, or other program decisions.’ 
        
       
       
        
        ……….. 
        
       
       
        
        The Government makes no apologies for changing the rights and responsibilities of offenders once they enter the program as, amongst other things, the potential benefits to offenders from participation in the program are enormous. Of course, the Drug Court program will allow appeals on sentence. These will be to a single judge of the Supreme Court. Such appeals are rightly retained as they relate more to a person’s due process rights at large than to internal decision made by the Drug Court.” 
        
       
      
    10 The legislation is effective in implementing the stated intentions. Neither the Drug Court Act nor the speech makes reference to appeals against sentence by the Crown. 
     
      
    11 This distinction between constitution of the court to hear an appeal by an offender and an appeal by the Crown in respect of the same (final) sentence might be considered anomalous and, as was indicated at the hearing would be done, it is drawn to attention.  
     
      
       
      THE OFFENCES OF THE RESPONDENT 
       
      
    12 As can be inferred from the terms of the Notice of Appeal, the charges against the respondent can be divided into two categories. The first category (charges 1 to 9) came before the Drug Court (constituted by his Honour Judge Barnett) on 19 December 2002 when the respondent sought admission into a drug program. Sentence was imposed in respect of the nine charges. These sentences were imposed pursuant to s7(2A) of the Drug Court Act 1998 (to which statute unreferenced sections hereafter refer) and were by definition “initial sentences” pursuant to s4(1). A mandatory order for suspension of the sentences was made (s7(3)(b)) upon his Honour’s order that the respondent participate in the relevant program. 
     
      
    13 After appearance at the Drug Court the respondent attended a clinic for the purpose of prescription of some medication and while there he met an acquaintance who gave him two tablets, possibly Rivotril, as a “celebratory gesture”. The respondent ingested the tablets in combination with his medication and he became “blurred”. He did not attend, as required, to enter the program. 
     
      
    14 Some time before midnight on 19 December 2002 the respondent broke and entered premises at Parramatta and stole a bank issued credit card. He went to a shopping centre which, the court was informed, was open overnight for the purpose of Christmas shopping. The respondent presented the card as payment for various purchases but on a final occasion, the store operative noted irregularities and the respondent was taken and held by shopping centre security at about 12 am on 20 December. Police had been contacted and they took the respondent into custody. 
     
      
    15 Investigations also identified the respondent as the perpetrator of breaking entering and stealing at a Granville address. This offence had occurred on 17 July 2001. Charges referrable to those two breaking and entering offences were the subject of a new indictment to which the respondent pleaded guilty. Offences of possessing a housebreaking implement and dishonestly obtaining goods by deception (using the stolen credit card) were taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    16 The second category of offence (charges 10 and 11 in the Director of Public Prosecution’s Notice of Appeal) were the offences on this indictment which was not dealt with in terms of the Drug Court Act. 
     
      
       
       
      INITIAL AND FINAL SENTENCE IN THE DRUG COURT 
       
      
    17 On 9 January 2003 the respondent’s Drug Court program was terminated by Judge Milson (s10(1)(b)). On 24 July 2003 he appeared before Barnett DCJ, who exercised the jurisdiction both of the Drug Court and the District Court, for final sentence in respect of the offences in the first category which I have mentioned and for sentence in respect of those in the second category. 
     
      
    18 In imposing final sentence for the first category the learned judge was bound to apply a prescription in s12(4) namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4) The final sentence determined for a drug offender in relation to an offence is not to be greater than the initial sentence imposed on the drug offender in relation to that offence.” 
        
       
      
    19 In the circumstances his Honour determined that none of the initial sentences should be reduced and final sentences were imposed in identical terms. Those sentences were therefore imposed at the upper limit of severity permitted by s12(4). 
     
      
       
      THE CROWN APPEAL AGAINST THE SENTENCES AFFECTED BY THE DRUG COURT ACT 
       
      
    20 As recited above, the Notice of Appeal is (in respect of the first category of sentences) exclusively directed to the final sentences. There is no reference to the initial sentences. This Court is, equally with a judge at first instance, bound by the restriction legislated in s12(4). The sentences were the maximum that could be imposed by that Court or by this Court. 
     
      
    21 The possibility of this being the case was raised during the hearing of the appeal and supplementary submission has been received on this aspect from the Crown. It is suggested that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be that the quantum of the initial sentence is not considered appealable but that some aspect of the final sentence, such as the absence of accumulation, is.”  
        
       
      
    22 I do not construe s12(4) so as to enable, by some manipulation of orders relating to of final sentence, an effective increase in the time which an offender will be kept in custody beyond that which would be the consequence of serving what has been specified as the initial sentence.  
     
      
    23 The supplementary submission continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Arguably the Crown could have appealed against that aspect of the sentence at the time it (initial sentence) was imposed. Realistically however the failure to comply had no practical effect because of the inevitable suspension of the sentences. To have appealed at that point is arguably contrary to the purpose of the Drug Court Act and irreconcilable with absence of the offender’s right of appeal against the initial sentence. While it is arguable that the failure to appeal the initial sentence creates an undesirable element of doubt in the offender’s approach to the programme it is fairer that the Crown only appeal once and that the appropriate time to appeal is when all relevant information is available to the Court. The latter position only arises after the imposition of the final sentence”. 
        
       
      
    24 It is true that, if the offender is to be admitted to a program, the initial sentence will inevitably be suspended (s7(3)(b)). The Crown submission was supported by a submission by counsel for the respondent to the extent that it conceded a right of the Crown to appeal against initial sentence in addition to a right to appeal against final sentence. However, it was submitted that where no appeal is brought against that initial sentence, the Crown cannot in an appeal against final sentence seek to impeach the initial sentence. No application was made by the Crown to amend the terms of its Notice of Appeal which, as recited above, was expressed to challenge final sentence. 
     
      
    25 The limitation on appeal by an offender in s5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act restricts challenge to final sentence whereas there is no special provision applicable to a Crown appeal which is brought pursuant to s5D of that Act. It was therefore submitted that there was a discernible approach reflecting “the paramountcy of the final sentence and the largely administrative function of the initial sentence.” 
     
      
    26 Initial sentence is defined as “any sentence imposed on a person in accordance with section 7 or 8AB, and includes any sentence that is added to the initial sentence in accordance with section 8AC” (s4). All of ss7, 8AB and 8AC specify that the person dealt with under those provisions is to be convicted and sentenced in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. See s7(2A), s8AB(3) and s8AC(3). 
     
      
    27 The imposition of initial sentence is an act of judicial character, not of administrative character. 
     
      
    28 There is nowhere to be found any limitation on appeal by the Crown asserting inadequacy of initial sentence and, whilst it is understandable that such may be considered awkward and potentially nugatory having regard to the possibility that an offender will satisfactorily complete the program and be dealt with more leniently when coming for final sentence, s12(4) operates to prevent any increase of final sentence so as to exceed the initial sentence. 
     
      
      THE EFFECTIVE SENTENCES 
       
      
    29 The restriction legislated by s12(4) which applies to offences in the first category does not apply to those in the second.  
     
      
    30 It is necessary however to look at the overall sentences in order to consider the adequacy of those imposed for the second category of offences. 
     
      
    31 Previously, the respondent was sentenced in Sydney District Court to a term of imprisonment of two and half years with a non-parole period of eighteen months dating from 10 April 2001. His parole date was 9 October 2002. On 12 July 2001 he escaped by walking away from a situation of minimum security. He was re-arrested on 25 August 2001. The offences in the first category were the escape and others committed whilst unlawfully at large. He was in custody from 25 August 2001 until 19 December 2002 when Barnett DCJ, sitting as the Drug Court imposed initial sentences, made the order for his admission to a drug programme and suspended those sentences. 
     
      
    32 When appearing for final sentence on 24 July 2003 the initial sentence for the escape was confirmed being imprisonment for six months to date from 23 November 2002 and to expire on 23 May 2003. Save charges 8 and 9, upon which fines had been imposed, the initial sentences, confirmed as final sentences on charges 1 to 5 and charge 7, were directed to commence on 22 May 2003. A parole eligibility date of 21 May 2004 was specified.  
     
      
    33 On charges 10 and 11 (the second category) he was sentenced to four years imprisonment from 22 May 2003 with a non-parole period of twelve months. His parole eligibility date remained unaltered at 21 May 2004. 34 Although, in my view, the Court has no power to intervene to increase the final sentences imposed in respect of the offences in the first category, they remain relevant as part of the extant record of the respondent available to be taken into account in determining whether he may not receive leniency which might otherwise be granted to him. Relevant to that consideration as well are offences on the respondent’s record going back to being dealt with in the Children’s Court in 1993.  
     
      
    35 In assessing the sentences imposed for the second category it was also appropriate to bear in mind the initial sentences (now confirmed as final sentences) in connection with applying the principle conveniently referred to as “totality”.  
     
      
       
      THE FACTS AND SUBJECTIVE MATTERS 
       
      
    36 The facts of the offences in the second category are sketched above. A little elaboration is apt. Shortly prior to midnight on the day he had been given the suspended initial sentences and directed to the drug program by Barnett DCJ, the respondent presented a credit card for payment for some sports shoes at a shop at the Westfield Mall at Parramatta. A call was made to the credit card centre and the respondent was asked to speak to the operator. He did so and was heard to say “Cut up the card”, after which he hung up the telephone and left. He was seen running out exit doors but was detained. On his journey he dropped a screwdriver.  
     
      
    37 Investigations showed the use of the card between 10 and 11 pm to purchase jeans, shirts and a screwdriver. The authorized holder of the card was identified and contacted. The card should have been at her home. Her husband was at the home and at the time awaiting police to whom he had reported an apparent break and enter. The main bedroom sliding door had been broken. 
     
      
    38 Later investigation demonstrated that the respondent was the perpetrator of another break and enter at Granville which had taken place on 27 July 2001. Cash, jewellery and a mobile phone valued at $2,550 had been taken. Repair to damage caused by the break was estimated to cost $1,000. 
     
      
    39 The respondent had a disrupted childhood. His mother had a son and daughter from another marriage. She married the respondent’s father thereafter. His half siblings reportedly had significant problems, the brother with offending and the sister with self-harming behaviour. His mother was French and the family resided in France for about two years. The marriage failed and the respondent stayed with his mother in the absence of his father from about the age of ten.  
     
      
    40 His mother owned and operated a restaurant in Kings Cross. He spent long hours unsupervised whilst she struggled to run the restaurant. He truanted from school. There were events, including a home invasion when his mother was threatened by having a knife put to her throat. This seemingly may have had some connection with an assertion that she was hiding drugs for his elder brother. The mother died of cancer in 1999.  
     
      
    41 The respondent has some contact with his father who now resides in Queensland. A letter addressed to the presiding judge dated 30 June 2003 confessed that he (the father) was an alcoholic and had been “a very poor parent and therefore feel part of the reason (the respondent) is before the court”.  
     
      
    42 He expressed a hope that his son could be “de-institutionalized”. 
     
      
    43 As at April 2003, the respondent had spent seven and half years of the last ten in custody. That proportion now approaches eight and half years of the last eleven.  
     
      
    44 Undoubtedly his criminal behaviour is significantly associated with a drug habit. A report from Ms Rhonda Danylenko, the alcohol and other drug worker at MRRC Silverwater, dated 23 April 2003 includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “Finally, Mr Toman has received no institutional charges this time in custody and has always presented stable during contact with the writer. Mr Toman is very much aware that he is responsible for his behaviour and that if he is to remain outside, long term, he will need to commit himself at a deeper level.” 
        
       
      
    45 Her report traces the respondent’s descent into illicit drug use. He started with excessive alcohol at age fifteen, used cannabis between the ages of seventeen and twenty three, and at twenty one had started smoking heroin. By aged twenty three he “graduated” to injecting heroin and by twenty five he was injecting cocaine. 
     
      
    46 In 2000 and 2002 he had some methadone and buprenophine treatment. He has never been admitted to a therapeutic centre such as WHOS, the William Booth Programme or Odyssey House. 
     
      
       
      INADEQUACY 
       
      
    47 Whilst, for reasons given, it is not open to the Crown to challenge the quantum of final sentence for the first category of offence and I acknowledge that the argument was put so as to encompass it, I understand the gravamen of complaint to be directed to the very short non-parole period which, leaving to one side the compulsory accumulation of the sentence for escape, effectively set the same non-parole period for the first and second category offences, that is a period expiring on 21 May 2004. Including the imposition for escape the overall effective term can be calculated as imprisonment for four years five months twenty nine days, with a non-parole period of seventeen months twenty nine days.  
     
      
    48 I have already stated that I consider the power of this Court is limited to intervention in respect of the sentences for the second category of offences, that is four years imprisonment to be served concurrently on each of the two counts with a non-parole period of twelve months. In the absence of any other circumstances, I would assess the imposition as manifestly inadequate in terms of the non-parole period set. I do not consider the head sentence of four years imprisonment so to be. 
     
      
    49 This Court has a residual discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal such as the present and I would exercise that discretion in this case for a combination of reasons.  
     
      
    50 The very great proportion of more than the last decade which this comparatively young offender has spent in custody suggests a real risk that he would re-offend. Should that occur he is at equal risk of being required to serve the head sentence of four years which I do not consider inadequate. If released to parole he would very much be his own keeper and the risk of further lengthy incarceration would, I estimate, be a significant deterrent.51 I infer that this may well be what Barnett DCJ had in mind, that is a proper and adequate head sentence but a lenient, in my view overly lenient, non-parole period but a chance for the respondent to see if he can lead a law abiding life as he seems to have persuaded the alcohol and other drugs worker he appreciates that he needs to do. Despite his rejection of the opportunity received from the Drug Court, it is possible that he may on release appreciate now the wisdom of seeking help from one of the rehabilitation programmes, in none of which to date has he engaged. An affidavit of the respondent received for use if resentence was to be undertaken, does mention that parole authorities, given the nearness of release date currently fixed, have made tentative arrangements for his reception into a twelve month residential program at Cecil O’Neill House run by the Society of St Vincent de Paul. 
     
      
    52 Although the Notice of Crown Appeal followed promptly the impositions of final sentence and sentence for the second category offences, the respondent would have been for a significant period conscious that the initial sentences would, even if confirmed as final sentences, be at a statutory “ceiling”. 
     
      
    53 In addition, in the ordinary course this appeal came on for hearing on 6 February 2004. As already noted, the eligibility date for parole is becoming imminent, that is 21 May next.  
     
      
    54 Although I have concluded that the setting of the non-parole period reflects inadequacy, I have also concluded that this is not a case in which I would intervene to vary the sentences and orders made in the court of first instance. 
     
      
    55 I would in the exercise of this Court’s discretion dismiss the Crown appeal.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 His Honour: On 17 November last the two offenders, Bradleigh Geoffrey John Walsh and Kathleen Sharp, were arraigned before a jury and myself. The offender Walsh pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. He indicated that his plea was on the basis of excessive self-defence. The Crown Prosecutor stated that he was not prepared to accept that plea in satisfaction of the indictment. The offender Sharp pleaded not guilty to both an offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder and, in the alternative, an offence of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter. 
     
      
    2 On 12 December 2003 the jury found the offender Walsh guilty of manslaughter and the offender Sharp guilty of being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter. I should say, although it is really no business of mine, that the verdicts were completely appropriate on the evidence before the jury. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years and that for being an accessory after the fact to manslaughter imprisonment for 5 years. This maximum penalty for the latter offence is in my view completely inadequate to deal with the criminality that such an offence might involve. In my view it says nothing about the very grave seriousness of assisting a person who the offender knows has unlawfully taken the life of another human being. It is technically the same maximum penalty that would apply to a person convicted of being an accessory to stealing a pencil from a shop. 
     
      
    4 In many cases, the criminality of an accessory after the fact to manslaughter will be the same as that of a person convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder. In both cases the accessory knows that an unlawful killing has occurred. The determination of the offence for which the offender is guilty will depend upon the offence for which the principal offender is convicted. That is the case here. In all probability had Mr Walsh been convicted of murder, Ms Sharp would have been convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder. If that had been the result she would have been liable to a maximum penalty of not 5 years imprisonment, but 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 However, I must sentence on the basis that Parliament has determined that an accessory after the fact to manslaughter is on any facts liable to a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. In this case, had I not been restricted by the maximum penalty, I would have sentenced the offender Sharp to a full-time custodial sentence. Ms Sharp’s criminality does not justify such a sentence as against the maximum penalty prescribed, notwithstanding the seriousness of her conduct. 
     
      
    6 The facts can be briefly given. There is little in dispute in the facts forming the basis of sentencing the two offenders in light of the verdicts of the jury. The resolution of the matters that are in dispute is probably a result of an impression of the material before the jury rather than by a close analysis of the facts or the issues litigated. However, I should say at the outset that in my view the basis upon which the offender pleaded guilty was completely unrealistic. Had Mr Walsh pleaded guilty before me on the grounds of excessive self-defence and given the account that he did before the jury, I doubt that I would have accepted the plea. If that account were accepted as a possible version of events, he would have been entitled in my view to a complete acquittal. I have no doubt at all that it was not the basis of the jury’s verdict. For reasons I shall give shortly I intend to sentence Mr Walsh on the basis of manslaughter by reason of provocation. I doubt however that makes a significant difference to an assessment of his criminality. 
     
      
    7 The deceased was an acquaintance of the offender Walsh and at the time of his death was staying with the offenders who were then in a close relationship and living together in a unit in Penrith. The offender Walsh and the deceased spent a considerable amount of their leisure time drinking alcohol together at various clubs and premises in the area. 
     
      
    8 On 15 March 2002, the evening preceding the death of the deceased, the offender Walsh and the deceased had been drinking in each other’s company at a local Leagues Club. A fight broke out between some patrons and the deceased became involved in an effort to separate the parties. Surveillance video apparently shows the offender attempting to assist the deceased by deflecting a person who was about to attack him. The security guards thought it would be in the best interests of the two men if they left the premises for the night. 
     
      
    9 The next sighting of the two of them was at licensed premises where they attempted to obtain more alcohol. When they were refused service, the deceased became extremely irate. He challenged the employees of the hotel to fight him and made threats to them in a very aggressive manner. During this dispute the offender Walsh remained passive and at one stage he became the focus of the deceased’s rage. 
     
      
    10 After they had left the vicinity of the tavern, the two were next seen near a shop attached to a service station. They began fighting each other because apparently the deceased blamed Walsh for them being refused alcohol. However, because of their drunken state only one blow met its mark. The deceased landed a punch to Walsh’s nose causing it to bleed. He was given tissue paper in an attempt to stem the flow of blood by the storeowner. The two were last seen leaving the vicinity of the shop apparently once more the best of friends. 
     
      
    11 The only evidence of what happened thereafter is from the offender Walsh who gave evidence before the jury. His account, which the jury must have accepted, was that when they arrived at the unit, the deceased became aggressive once more. There were some angry words exchanged between them but they did not come to blows. The offender Sharp came out of her bedroom annoyed at the noise. Mr Walsh asked the deceased to leave the premises and he and Ms Sharp went to look for Walsh’s glasses that he had lost during the scuffle with the deceased near the shop. 
     
      
    12 They were unsuccessful in finding the glasses, and when returning home the offenders called in to see a friend and neighbour, Mr Marshall. I am prepared to disregard Mr Marshall’s account of that visit as it is inconsistent with Mr Walsh’s account as to when the killing occurred, and, therefore, in my view, inconsistent with the jury’s verdict. Mr Marshall, in any event, was not an impressive witness and the Crown in his address to the jury placed little reliance on his evidence. On Mr Walsh’s version of events he wanted Mr Marshall’s advice as to what he should do about the deceased. 
     
      
    13 On arriving home the deceased was sitting in the loungeroom holding a piece of wood. Police found such a weapon in the premises when they searched the unit after the killing. Ms Sharp went to her bedroom. The deceased said he was not leaving and Mr Walsh told him to go to bed and they would sort it out in the morning. When Mr Walsh went to his bedroom, Ms Sharp told him that she was scared of the deceased and wanted him to leave immediately. Mr Walsh tried to reason that it would be better to wait until the morning, but Ms Sharp insisted that the deceased leave straight away. 
     
      
    14 The offender Walsh went to the deceased’s bedroom. The deceased was lying on the bed and, when Walsh entered, the deceased took hold of the piece of wood. Walsh told him he would call the police if he did not leave, and with that the deceased commenced to strike him with the piece of Wood. In short Walsh’s account was that during a struggle with the deceased, who continued to strike him, he managed to take hold of a hammer that was in the room in a workbag and struck at the deceased while trying to fend him off. This caused the deceased to become more enraged and recommenced his attack upon Walsh with more vigour threatening to kill him. Walsh then struck the deceased with the hammer three times while trying to protect himself and the deceased fell to the floor apparently dead. 
     
      
    15 As I have indicated, the plea to the charge of manslaughter by Mr Walsh was based upon excessive self-defence derived from an apparent acceptance by him that the third blow struck was excessive, even though on his account it followed immediately upon the second. His evidence was that the earlier two blows had not caused the deceased to bleed. As I have already indicated I believe that a plea of guilty on that basis is unsustainable. In any event I do not accept that Mr Walsh only struck the deceased three times, but I shall return to that matter shortly. 
     
      
    16 Mr Walsh returned to the bedroom where Ms Sharp was and told her what had happened. She went to the room and confirmed that the deceased was dead. Some time later, after he awoke from a drunken sleep, Mr Walsh told Ms Sharp that they should take the body and bury it. Ms Sharp then assisted in wrapping the body and disposing of it at a property owned by Mr Walsh’s grandmother. Mr Walsh, with Ms Sharp’s assistance, dragged the body to the balcony of the unit. Ms Sharp obtained her vehicle and parked it beneath the balcony. Mr Walsh threw the body off the balcony to where the vehicle was parked. The body was loaded on to the tray of the utility. The bloody mattress from the bed on which the deceased had been placed was also thrown from the balcony. The body of the deceased was covered with that mattress and a second one that they found downstairs. 
     
      
    17 Ms Sharp called her place of employment and said that she would not be attending work that day because she was unwell. The real reason she could not go to work was because she was to assist Mr Walsh remove the body and dispose of it. 
     
      
    18 Ms Sharp then drove Mr Walsh and the body to the property where it was to be buried. There is no doubt in my mind that it was here that Mr Walsh first beheaded and then dismembered the body. I do not accept his account of having accidentally run over the body with a thrashing machine after he had cut the head off. This account was improbable in the extreme. The offender could never adequately explain to the jury why he would have driven the machine from his grandmother’s premises to the property if it had been his intention to bury the body. The whole account of running over the head and the body inflicting terrible wounds to the head and torso but leaving the arms virtually intact but severed from the body is in my view impossible. It is a fabrication designed to account principally for the numerous wounds inflicted to the head of the deceased. In this regard I prefer the forensic evidence in the Crown case to that called by the defence. I have also taken into account that Mr Walsh had later confessed to friends that he cut up the body. 
     
      
    19 There is little doubt that Mr Walsh behaved in a very bizarre manner when persons at the neighbouring property saw him on that day. They considered that he was under the influence of some substance. He told them he was going to have a bonfire on the property. This was because he was going to burn the mattresses and did not want the neighbours to notice the fire and summon help. At one stage he wandered onto the neighbouring property, carrying a large knife and his hands apparently covered in blood. He asked whether he could use a tap but was told to leave. I have no doubt that by this time he had dismembered the body. The fact that he behaved in this way shows how disordered his thinking was at the time possibly because of the effects of alcohol and the horror or emotion arising from what he had done. 
     
      
    20 The dismembered body was placed into plastic bags and the vehicle was then driven by Ms Sharp to a repair shop where the tray was washed to remove the blood. Later that day or shortly thereafter Ms Sharp drove Mr Walsh to the Hawkesbury River and the body parts were thrown by him into the river. In the days thereafter the deceased’s arms and head were recovered from the river but the rest of the body has never been located. 
     
      
    21 The offenders attempted to clean the unit of blood from the walls and carpet. Ms Sharp borrowed a carpet cleaner from a friend and I have no doubt this was done by her for the purpose of cleaning blood from the carpet in the unit. 
     
      
    22 Investigations soon centred on the offenders and police obtained warrants to listen to telephone conversations from the unit. Those calls indicate that the offenders embarked upon a campaign of misinformation concerning the disappearance of the deceased. The story concocted was that he had left the unit intending to travel to Queensland in order to avoid attending court. They suggested to various persons that he was probably killed by some bikey group with whom he had drug associations. 
     
      
    23 During some of these conversations Ms Sharp repeats to Mr Walsh conversations she had previously had with various persons in which she had expressed in strong terms her dissatisfaction with the police investigation because of the disruption it had caused to their lives and the fact that the police were unreasonably suspicious of them. She repeats advice that she has been given by her mother to protect herself and Mr Walsh from police misconduct in their investigations of apparently innocent people. On some calls to friends she has expressed her indignation that the police had not returned her vehicle and that they had undertaken forensic procedure looking for blood in the unit. There is little doubt that many things said by the two of them were on the basis that the conversations might have been listened to by police. 
     
      
    24 This material is important for two reasons. Firstly it is evidence of the lengths that Ms Sharp would undertake to protect and assist Mr Walsh, even though she had time for calm reflection upon what she had done and what she was doing. Secondly it relates to the nature of the relationship between the two offenders. In my view it is material that leads me to reject the views expressed by a psychologist based upon what Ms Sharp had told her about the nature of the relationship that she had with Mr Walsh. Ms Sharp came across in the conversations, at least to my mind and in her evidence in court as a highly manipulative and assertive young woman. Certainly that is how she dealt with the police in their investigations and that is how she portrayed herself to Mr Walsh when relating to him what had happened between her and the police. 
     
      
    25 True it is that after their arrest and when Mr Walsh was in custody he sent her letters that contains threats against her when he feared that she might not support him in the version that they had concocted together when it came to the trial. It is perhaps significant that she kept the letters and sought to use them against Mr Walsh when she did in fact attempt to distance herself from any wrong doing in relation to the killing or its aftermaths at the expense of Mr Walsh. It was clear during Mr Walsh’s evidence at the trial that Ms Sharp made eye contact with him at various times during his evidence, times when it might have been that Mr Walsh would have implicated her. This caused Mr Walsh to give false evidence as to the role played by her in disposing of the body. I believe that she intentionally did this relying upon the fact that despite what had happened and what he had written in the letters, she knew Mr Walsh still had some affection for her. 
     
      
    26 It is clear to me that the person who was deeply troubled by what had occurred was in fact Mr Walsh and not Ms Sharp. Walsh eventually when under the influence of alcohol began to confess his crime. He even rang a former police officer for advice as to what he should do and whether he could trust the police officer in charge of the investigation. The plea of guilty is evidence of some contrition that was being displayed by Mr Walsh on occasions even though he was never able to go to police and confess what had happened. 
     
      
    27 On the other hand Ms Sharp has shown no contrition at all. This is not just because she pleaded not guilty and told the most brazen lies in her evidence before the jury, but because of her attitude displayed in the conversations on the telephone both to Mr Walsh and others about the death of the deceased and the investigation by police. I still do not believe that she shows any remorse and apparently maintains her fanciful and fantastic account that she had no belief that Mr Walsh had killed the deceased until he admitted doing so by his plea of guilty. I find it difficult to understand how an apparently intelligent young woman of generally good character and upbringing and without any obvious mental impairment could give such patently false evidence or believe that any one, let alone a jury of apparently sensible citizens, could possibly accept any part of it. 
     
      
    28 I do not intend to detail the numerous palpably false statements made by Ms Sharp to the jury on oath lest it be thought that in some way I am increasing her sentence because of her conduct during the trial or because of the defence that she ran before the jury. I only raise the matter in a general way because of what it says about her character and her relationship with Mr Walsh in light of the material placed before me on sentence. I think that Ms Sharp believes that she is capable of manipulating the truth and deceiving people without being found out. No doubt on some occasions she can succeed but not with persons, who like a jury, are objectively evaluating what she says against known facts. 
     
      
    29 As I have already indicated, I intend to sentence Mr Walsh on the basis that he acted under provocation in killing the deceased. I do that on the basis that I do not believe that his evidence was consistent with acting in excessive self-defence and also because I am satisfied that he struck the deceased a deal more than three times. As I have already stated, I do not believe the account Mr Walsh gave of the head of the deceased being inadvertently damaged by a thrashing machine. The only possible reason for that evidence was to disguise the number and severity of the blows inflicted upon the deceased by him in the flat. The viciousness of the assault upon the deceased is consistent with a loss of self-control on the part of Mr Walsh because of the deceased’s conduct to him earlier in the night and then in the second bedroom. The method in which the body was disposed is also, in my view more consistent with a killing under provocation than one occurring in self-defence. 
     
      
    30 I believe that otherwise the account of the death of the deceased by Mr Walsh is probably correct and was accepted by the jury as at least a possible version. It is consistent with what is known of the conduct of the two of them, and as difficult as it may be for the deceased’s sisters to believe it, there is no doubt that on that night the deceased was highly aggressive and belligerent. I have little doubt that it was he who instigated the violence that resulted in his death and the jury must have found that to be the case. This of course does not excuse Mr Walsh from what he did, nor does it in any way justify the killing of the deceased or the manner in which the body was treated thereafter. But it is a significant matter when looking both at the culpability of Mr Walsh and in assessing his threat to the community when he is at liberty. 
     
      
    31 This is a case where Mr Walsh acted in the heat of the moment having been provoked not only at the time of killing but in the hours leading up to it by the conduct of the deceased toward him. He did not arm himself to injure Mr Walsh but picked up an object in the course of defending himself from an armed attack. There was no real dispute at the trial that the hammer, which was used to inflict the injuries to the deceased, was in the second bedroom at the time of the attack by the deceased upon Mr Walsh. Mr Walsh was labouring under the difficulty of being without his glasses and has poor vision without them. 
     
      
    32 The Crown presented written submissions before me on sentence that with respect were fair to the offender and of considerable assistance to the court. It is conceded that the defence indicated about two weeks before the trial that Mr Walsh was willing to plead guilty to manslaughter. It was not his fault that the Crown rejected the plea and a trial had to proceed on a charge of murder. The admission made in front of the jury, in any event considerably limited the issues in dispute between Mr Walsh and the Crown. Both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Greenhill SC appearing for Mr Walsh accepted that a discount of 15 per cent was an appropriate discount of the otherwise appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    33 In determining the sentence to be imposed on both offenders I have to consider the matters set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. To some extent the section is illogical because in some cases it specifies that the existence of a particular fact is an aggravating factor and yet the non-existence of the same fact is a mitigating factor. For example, the fact that the present offence was not planned is listed as a mitigating factor, but had it been planned that would have been an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    34 One of the issues that is raised by the matters listed in the section is whether the effect of the death of the deceased person on other persons is an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(g) or whether the apparent width of that provision is to be limited by the common law view, entrenched when the section was enacted, that the effect of the death of the deceased upon family members and friends was an irrelevant consideration on the question of the severity of the sentence to be imposed for the killing. It should be noted that s 28(3) of the Act provides that, in relation to a victim impact statement, where the primary victim has died, the court may “make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate”. The section says nothing about the use that may be made of the statement in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    35 It is inappropriate and unnecessary to attempt to resolve that issue in the present case but I should at this point in time refer to the victim impact statements that were placed before the Court. It is most regrettable that in the present case a very substantial part of the statement of one of the deceased’s sisters that was prepared by her to be read in court had to be rejected when the Crown tendered it. The majority of what the sister wished to say was simply not admissible. A victim impact statement is exactly that, a statement of the impact of the crime upon the victim. It is defined as such in s 26 of the Act. It cannot include comments on the evidence given in the trial nor be used to advocate that any particular sentence be imposed upon the offender. It must not seek to urge upon the sentencing court to find particular facts or to take a particular approach in determining what aspect of punishment is important in the particular case. These are matters properly for the Crown to advocate and not the victim.  
     
      
    36 I make these remarks not in any way to criticise the deceased’s sister for the contents of the statement placed before me. She is not to be taken to have known the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relating to victim impact statements. It may not be the duty of the Crown to vet such statements or to determine whether they are admissible, but in this case and in at least one other that has recently been before me, members of the office of the DPP were assisting the victims through the trial and during the sentencing hearing. They should make some attempt to counsel the victim as to the proper matters to be placed in a statement before it is prepared and particularly before it is presented to the Court. I do not believe the Crown should tender a statement that contains material that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act as it did in the present case. I understand that it is difficult enough for a victim to sit through criminal proceedings without having to face the situation that arose both in this and in the other case to which I have referred. Objection was properly taken to the contents of the statement and the Court could not receive it in the form in which it was tendered. The victim should not have to face frustration and disappointment because of a false expectation about what he or she could place before the court where in my view appropriate counselling and assistance might have prevented that situation arising. 
     
      
    37 However that might be, the statements as finally presented allowed the sisters of the deceased to express the impact upon them of not only the effect of the death of the deceased but also the manner in which the offenders disposed of the body. They were able to do it not only in public but also in the presence of the persons who were responsible for inflicting that pain and suffering upon them. The Crown did not ultimately seek to have the statements used to increase the sentence or aggravate the crime. But the manner in which the offenders disposed of the body is clearly an aggravating feature to be reflected in an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Defence counsel conceded that this was so in light of authorities from various jurisdictions referred to in the Crown’s submissions. It is unnecessary to detail them in these remarks. 
     
      
    38 Mr Walsh is 32 years of age. He has a criminal record dating back to 1990. Much of it can be disregarded but there are matters of violence. He has a conviction for intimidating a witness. He received a gaol sentence in 1997 for false imprisonment and for an assault inflicting actual bodily harm. The facts of those offences were placed before me. They involved another co-offender, and they reveal a serious attack upon the victim including placing a noose around his neck and tightening it. In 1999 the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for multiple offences of intimidation arising from letters he had written of a very threatening nature to a former de facto partner. The letters he sent to Ms Sharp can be seen as similar to conduct for which he has been punished on earlier occasions. 
     
      
    39 However, that record is of little relevance to the sentence to be imposed for the killing of the deceased having regard to the circumstances in which the crime arose. It does indicate, however, that the offender has a violent aspect to his character even when he is not provoked. It disentitles him to leniency on this occasion but no more than that. I do not believe at this stage it warrants a sentence that is increased for the purposes of specific deterrence. 
     
      
    40 A sentence for manslaughter must reflect the seriousness of unlawfully taking the life of another human being and it is in my view not of great moment whether the killing is characterised as coming within any particular head of manslaughter. It is a question of what sentence is required to reflect the objective facts by way of retribution, denunciation and, if necessary, deterrence. Rehabilitation is not really an issue in the present case. The offender must know by now that he might act violently under the influence of alcohol and it is up to him to address that issue if he wishes to do so. He has been to gaol before because of it, he has received counselling before because of it; and he must know that, unless he addresses the problem, he is at risk of committing further serious offences and spending even longer periods in gaol. He is not yet a danger to the community but is heading down that path. 
     
      
    41 I have been given some other sentences that have been imposed for manslaughter as an indication of the appropriate sentence in the present case but they provide little guidance because the facts and circumstances can vary so greatly. However In R v Marlow [2003] NSWSC 1130, Studdert J helpfully reviewed the sentences imposed for offences of manslaughter arising from a killing under provocation. I have considered the matters to which Hunt CJ at CL referred in R v Alexander (1995) 78 A Crim R 141. The degree of provocation was substantial and the time between the provocation and the killing was non-existent. Both of these factors reduce the objective seriousness of the offence. However, the degree of violence was substantial with the offender striking the head of the deceased on at least 7 or 8 occasions with a hammer. This is a matter that increases the objective seriousness of the offence because it was clearly excessive. However, the victim was armed at the time and endeavouring to inflict serious injuries upon the offender. On the other hand, there is the aggravating feature of the dismemberment of the body and it being thrown in the Hawkesbury River that is to be taken into account. 
     
      
    42 The most significant subjective matter to be considered in my view is the offender’s medical condition. He has a long history of heart disease derived from a physiological defect at birth. At times through his life his situation has been critical if not perilous and he has undergone numerous operations. He must take an anti-coagulate that puts him at risk of excessive blood loss. He is said to have only a moderate fitness level and strength. It is surprising, therefore, to find him engaging in acts of significant violence. His condition is said to present treatment problems for him in custody. In 1995 his treating doctor prepared a report in which he expressed the opinion that he doubted that the offender would obtain appropriate treatment in a prison environment. A similar view was expressed by him in 1997, 2002 and most recently in a report dated 18 February 2004. 
     
      
    43 The simple fact is, however, that the offender continues to offend by acts of violence or threats of violence notwithstanding his medical condition and the danger it poses for him if he is returned to custody. There is no evidence before me that he was not properly treated while serving his past gaol sentences or that he could not be provided with adequate control and treatment during the impending period of incarceration. There is evidence that he has been declared as suitable for various types of employment in the gaol and has been working while on remand. Unfortunately, while there can be great sympathy for the offender due to his illness and its effect upon him physically and emotionally, his conduct on this occasion requires a salutary prison sentence and little weight can be given to his physical condition which was present at the time he committed the offence. I do not believe that the condition was a significant contributing factor to the commission of the offence and is not a mitigating factor in that regard. 
     
      
    44 I am of the view that there are no special circumstances in the present case that require a reduction in the non-parole period. The only matters relied upon by Mr Greenhill was his medical condition and the nature of the offence committed. Those are both matters that are principally relevant to a determination of the head sentence. There is nothing before me that indicates that the offender needs an extended period on parole and there is no other reason to reduce the non-parole period. 
     
      
    45 If Mr Walsh had not pleaded guilty I would have sentenced him to imprisonment for 8½ years. However, by reason of the discount I have earlier indicated, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years 3 months to commence on 14 May 2002. I specify a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months to expire on 13 November 2007 the date upon which you are eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    46 Ms Sharp is to be sentenced on the basis that she was aware that Mr Walsh had unlawfully killed the deceased, she had seen the body and she was prepared to assist him in the disposal of the body, cleaning the unit and to manufacture a story to account for the fact that the deceased was missing. In my view she adopted her role with gusto. Mr Walsh gave evidence that it was she who first came up with the story that was used to explain his disappearance, and I think that is probably correct. 
     
      
    47 I accept that she assisted her co-offender because of her relationship with him but that was based upon affection rather than fear. I have taken into account what she said to Detective Bennett about her fear of the offender, but I doubt that it was a true reflection of her feelings. It is inconsistent with the objective evidence as to their relationship at the time of the killing. Rather than merely following orders or complying with the requests of Mr Walsh, I suspect that she was actively involved in determining what course should be taken to dispose of the body and the evidence of the killing. It was she who organised and obtained the carpet cleaner. 
     
      
    48 Ms Sharp is aged 23 years and has no prior criminal record of any kind. She is normally a hard working and worthwhile citizen in the community. She poses no further risk to the community except from what she might do because she felt it was necessary to preserve a relationship in which she was then involved. Rehabilitation is not a significant matter in this case because I doubt that she needs to be rehabilitated. She has entered into a new stable relation, returned to her employment and has given birth to a child since committing the offence. Although the offence on one view was not planned in that she committed herself to assist Mr Walsh soon after the killing, the offence continued over a significant period of time and she had ample opportunity to consider what she had done and what she was doing in hiding the fact of the killing. 
     
      
    49 I have noted my concern at her lack of remorse and her false evidence. That is behaviour inconsistent with what otherwise appears to be her character. It continues to the present day and is reflected in a statement that she made to the probation officer that had she known Mr Walsh had harmed the deceased she would have gone to the police. Although Ms Sharp maintains that her co-offender was physically abusive and verbally degrading of her when he was drunk and that may be one of the very few true statement she has made in connection with the killing, I do not think that represents the complete picture of the dynamics of the relationship. 
     
      
    50 Ms Sharp became distressed when speaking to the probation officer about the offence, but that appears to have been because of the effect upon her family members. There is in my view no sign of sympathy or compassion for the deceased’s family. 
     
      
    51 The psychologist prepared a report for the sentencing of the offender. Much of it concerns Ms Sharp’s account of her relationship with Mr Walsh. I would not be prepared to believe anything that Ms Sharp has to say about her involvement in the offence or the nature of her relationship with her co-offender. As I have already indicated she is prepared to attempt to manipulate people and to unashamedly manufacture the most outrageous lies to exonerate herself from any wrongdoing whatsoever. I am prepared to accept that, by reason of the letters written to her by Mr Walsh from custody, she may now be afraid of him, but that was not the situation at the time when she was assisting him after the killing. 
     
      
    52 It may well be the case that some aspect or other of her personality made her dependent upon Mr Walsh during their relationship. But I do not believe, as the psychologist would suggest, that it went so far as her giving up responsibility for decisions. The following statement made by the psychologist and derived from psychological testing is in my opinion a false reflection of her relationship with Mr Walsh; “To maintain friendships, she may be submissive and co-operative and cover up any unpleasant emotions out of fear of alienating others”. The conclusion that Ms Sharp “will be submissive, co-operative and congenial rather than confronting and assertive” is simply not in accordance with the evidence as to her behaviour following the killing, which is quite to the contrary. 
     
      
    53 It is significant, in my opinion, that the psychologist had not heard the telephone conversations or her dealings with police, had not seen Ms Sharp give evidence nor apparently did she know the real facts of the offence committed by her. I do not find the psychological report to be of any assistance because I am not satisfied that it is based upon a reliable factual basis, notwithstanding the interpretation of the tests administered to Ms Sharp. I have also indicated that I am prepared to accept that she acted in order to assist Mr Walsh because of their relationship, but there is no suggestion in my mind that she did so because of fear or oppression imposed upon her by that relationship. 
     
      
    54 I have been made aware of the relevant statistics relating to this offence and two cases where an offender has been sentenced for this offence and received non-custodial sentences. Needless to say the limited number of cases in the statistics do not assist the task before me. There is no range established. The Crown has submitted that Ms Sharp should receive a gaol sentence but that the Court might consider a sentence that does not require her to serve full-time custody. I believe with respect that they are appropriate and fair submissions. Although Mr Webb urged that I should sentence his client by ordering her to perform community service, I do not believe that such a sentence would appropriately denunciate her criminal activity or serve as a deterrent to others in protecting an offender from such a serious criminal act. 
     
      
    55 Ms Sharp has a child aged four-months, I have taken that fact into account although it can have little weight given the seriousness of her criminal conduct. Mr Webb to his credit and that of his client did not seek to use that fact at the trial or in the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
    56 I indicated when sitting as a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 the manner in which I believe that sentencing should be approached having regard to the numerous sentencing options that are available to a court in this State. In my opinion the offender Sharp must receive a gaol sentence and, in my view, it should be a sentence of not less than 2 years imprisonment. That being the case I am able to consider the options of a non custodial order by way of suspended sentence or periodic detention. I am of the opinion that a suspended sentence is not appropriate given the criminality involved in this case and Ms Sharp’s rehabilitation is not a matter that seems to me to be a significant consideration outweighing the other factors important in sentencing her. However, having regard to her previous good character and the circumstances in which she committed the offence, that is because of the relationship in which she was in, I am prepared to accept that a proper sentence to fulfil the requirements of punishment in this case is a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    57 I see no point in fixing a parole period as none seems to be necessary to assist Ms Sharp. In any event, I have taken into account the sentence is imposed purely to punish her for her criminal behaviour and in an attempt to deter others from similar conduct. I also believe that I am entitled to take into account the fact that the sentence is to be served by periodic detention when determining whether there is a necessity to fix a non-parole period.58 Ms Sharp you are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years. I order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention at Norma Parker Detention Centre. It is to commence on Friday 12 March 2004 and expire on 11 March 2006.

        Regina v Dusan Pavicevic 
        
        
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
     1  
     JAMES J:  
      Dusan Pavicevic has appealed against sentences imposed on him on 11 November 2002 in the Parramatta Drug Court by his Honour Judge Milson. The sentences imposed by Judge Milson on 11 November 2002 were final sentences, imposed pursuant to s 12 of the  
     Drug Court Act  
     (“the Act”), after initial sentences for the same offences had been imposed, an order had been made imposing the conditions of a drug program to be undertaken by the appellant, the execution of the initial sentences had been suspended, the appellant had, for a time, undertaken the drug program, the Drug Court had decided on 6 August 2002 to terminate the appellant’s drug program and the Drug Court had on 11 November 2002 reconsidered the initial sentences.  
      
       
      
     2 This appeal was originally listed before a bench of three judges constituting the Court of Criminal Appeal. However, the Court drew the parties’ attention to s 5AF(3) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     , 
      which provides that the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine an appeal under s 5AF is to be exercised by such single judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct. Subsequently, the Chief Justice directed that I should hear and determine this appeal. 
      
       
      
     3 On 8 May 2001 Judge Milson dealt with the appellant in accordance with s 7 of the Act in relation to fifteen offences to which the appellant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court. The offences consisted of four offences of receiving, two offences of goods in custody, two offences of breaking, entering and stealing, one offence of breaking and entering with intent, two offences of possession of a prohibited weapon, one offence of possession of housebreaking implements, one offence of possession of car breaking implements and two offences of maliciously damaging property. The offences had been committed between 16 May 2000 and 27 December 2000. 
      
       
      
     4 On 8 May 2001 Judge Milson imposed sentences of imprisonment of six months for all of the offences, except for the two offences, of breaking, entering and stealing and the offence of breaking and entering with intent. For each of the two offences of breaking, entering and stealing, which had been committed on 16 November 2000 and 6 December 2000 respectively, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for one year eight months and two weeks. His Honour arrived at the term of one year eight months and two weeks by deducting the period of approximately three and a half months from 27 December 2000 to 11 April 2001, during which the appellant had been in custody, from the period of two years which his Honour said would otherwise have been the length of the sentences his Honour would have imposed. His Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment of one year for the offence of breaking and entering with intent.  
      
       
      
     5 Having imposed these sentences, which were initial sentences pursuant to s 7(2A) of the Act, his Honour made an order pursuant to s 7(3)(a) of the Act, imposing on the appellant the conditions the appellant had accepted as the conditions of a drug program he was to undertake and his Honour made an order pursuant to s 7(3)(b) of the Act, suspending the execution of the sentences for the duration of the drug program. 
      
       
      
     6 The appellant entered into the drug program. In paras 13 to 18 inclusive of Judge Milson’s remarks on sentence of 11 November 2002, his Honour summarised the history of the appellant’s participation in the drug program. In paras 13 to 18 of his remarks on sentence his Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
         “He then entered a Drug Court program. In sentencing him for those offences today I am required to take into account the nature of his participation in his Drug Court program. Having entered in May 2001 he remained on the program until he went into custody on 17 July 2002 when arrested for subsequent offences. He had progressed satisfactorily, although there were sanctions for repeated drug use on a number of occasions and on one occasion a warrant had issued when he had failed to come to court. He subsequently did surrender without the execution of that warrant and he had a medical certificate to explain his absence. 
         
        
        
         
         In November he moved into phase two of the Drug Court program and through December he was continuing to go very well. In summary, he put in seven months of compliance with his program and in many respects did well and was congratulated, so much so that sanctions that had been imposed for breaches of his program had been waived as a reward for his good performance on his program. 
         
        
        
         
         In January 2002 things started to get worse. He had stopped taking his Naltrexone and drug tests were revealing the presence of illegal drugs. It appeared that during that time he had in effect abandoned his program by not coming to court on the thirty first, by failing to obey directions to come to court that had been given to him by a nurse, by a number of heroin uses, of cocaine use and missed drug tests. At that stage he was anxious about starting or resuming his TAFE course but certainly was not doing his Drug Court program. 
         
        
        
         
         On 20 February 2002 an employer thought so highly of him that he came to support even though he had continued to breach his program and had [to] serve custodial sanctions. 
         
        
        
         
         By the end of his program he had in fact served forty four days in custody for breaches of his program. He abandoned his program in March and a warrant was executed about a month later. In the light of evidence the Court heard about him going down to his sister’s place in Queanbeyan where he detoxified and as the Court was aware that he had remained in treatment it was decided that he could continue. 
         
        
        
         
         In May there was an offence involving the dishonest use of somebody else’s motor vehicle when he was arrested in Fairfield. The Court decided to give him the opportunty to prove that there remained a useful purpose within the Drug Court program but before that could come to pass he again left. Warrants were issued and he was charged with a number of other offences”. 
         
        
       
      
     7 Between 23 March 2002 and 17 July 2002 the appellant committed a further fourteen offences. These offences were two offences of driving a conveyance without consent, three offences of being an unlicensed driver, two offences of possession of car breaking implements, one offence of goods in custody, one offence of driving in a dangerous manner, one offence of stating a false name as a driver of a vehicle, one offence of taking and driving a conveyance, two offences of larceny and one offence of self-administering a prohibited drug. 
      
       
      
     8 The appellant was arrested on 17 July 2002 and remained in custody between 17 July 2002 and 11 November 2002. On 6 August 2002 the Drug Court, pursuant to s 10 of the Act, terminated the appellant’s drug program, on the basis that the appellant had failed to comply with the program and the Court was satisfied that the appellant was unlikely to make any further progress in the program. 
      
       
      
     9 On 11 November 2002 Judge Milson reconsidered the initial sentences which had been imposed on the appellant on 8 May 2001 and also sentenced the appellant for the further offences committed between 23 March 2002 and 17 July 2002. In his remarks on sentence delivered on 11 November 2002 Judge Milson stated the facts of the original offences, summarised the history of the appellant’s participation in the drug program, referred to medical evidence about the appellant including evidence from Dr Reid of the Corrections Medical Service and summarised the criminal history of the appellant.  
      
       
      
     10 A report from Dr Reid dated 11 November 2002 was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence. In his report Doctor Reid said that he had diagnosed the appellant as suffering from a major depressive illness, both when committing the original offences and when committing the further offences.  
      
       
      
     11 In para 22 of his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It has been stressed to the Court today, and I think on earlier occasions, that the offender does not attribute any blame for his criminal behaviour on events in his life and in particular the death of his mother when he was a teenager. I do not think that Dr Reid agrees entirely with that and I think the suggestions and implications of the report are that Mr Pavicevic continues to block both his feelings towards his father’s cancer and his attitudes to the death of his mother at a time when it would be expected to be significant in his life and at a time which coincidently, marked the commencement of his criminal record” 
         
        
       
      
     12 In para 30 of his remarks on sentence, Judge Milson said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Having set aside those sentences which were initially imposed and considering the nature of his participation in his Drug Court program, the length of time that he went well on that program, the subjective features relating to his family which I did not take into account to any great extent when he was originally sentenced, I am of the view that the sentences then imposed ought to be significantly reduced.” 
         
        
       
      
     13 Apart from the sentences for the two offences of breaking, entering and stealing, the final sentences which Judge Milson imposed on 11 November 2002 for the original offences were the same in length as the initial sentences which his Honour had imposed on 8 May 2001. For each of the two offences of breaking, entering and stealing, his Honour imposed a sentence of one year and three months in lieu of the initial sentence for each offence of one year eight months two weeks. His Honour ordered that all of the final sentences commence from 17 July 2002, the date when the appellant had been taken into custody. 
      
       
      
     14 For all of the further offences, subject to three exceptions, his Honour imposed sentences of imprisonment for twelve months or six months or until the rising of the Court, all these sentences also to date from 17 July 2002. For the offence of taking and driving a conveyance and taking into account an offence of larceny and an offence of self-administering a prohibited drug, his Honour, exercising the jurisdiction of the District Court, imposed a sentence of two years to commence on 17 October 2003, that is on the expiration of the two final sentences for breaking, entering and stealing. His Honour set a non-parole period of nine months. In setting such a non-parole period his Honour took into account that the sentence was to be served cumulatively on other sentences and that “the time that the offender has spent meaningfully on his Drug Court program indicates that there are in fact real prospects of his rehabilitation” and his Honour also took into account Dr Reid’s report. 
      
       
      
     15 As I have already noted, Judge Milson in sentencing the appellant for the offence of taking and driving a conveyance was exercising the jurisdiction of the District Court. In imposing all the other sentences, both for the original offences and the further offences, his Honour was exercising the jurisdiction of the Local Court and was subject to the restrictions applying to the sentencing of offenders in the Local Court.  
      
       
      
     16 The present appeal against sentence is limited to the final sentences imposed for the original offences. No complaint has been made about the sentences for the further offences. 
      
       
      
     17 Indeed, it would seem to me that any appeal against the sentences for the further offences would not be an appeal within s 5AF of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
      and could not be heard by a single judge as constituting the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
      
       
      
     18 Counsel for the appellant’s written submissions contain references to s 12 of the Act and it is convenient to set out the provisions of s 12. 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) On terminating a drug offender’s program, the Drug Court must reconsider the drug offender’s initial sentence. 
          
         (2) In reconsidering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court must take into consideration:  
          
         (a) the nature of the drug offender’s participation in his or her program, and 
          
         (b) any sanctions that have been imposed on the drug offender during the program, and 
          
         (c) any time for which the drug offender has been held in custody in connection with an offence to which his or her program relates, including time during which the person has undergone imprisonment:  
          
         (i) under the sentence, or 
          
         (ii) under the condition of the program arising under section 8A. 
          
         (3) After considering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court is to determine the drug offender’s final sentence:  
          
         (a) by making an order setting aside the initial sentence and taking such action under Part 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it could have taken for the offence to which the initial sentence related, or 
          
         (b) by making an order confirming the initial sentence. 
          
         (4) The final sentence determined for a drug offender in relation to an offence is not to be greater than the initial sentence imposed on the drug offender in relation to that offence. 
          
         (5) (Repealed)” 
          
          
         
        
       
      
     19 In counsel for the appellant’s written submissions two grounds of appeal were relied on. However, at the hearing of the appeal I gave leave to the appellant to rely on a further, third, ground of appeal. I will deal with the grounds of appeal in turn.  
      
       
        
       Ground 1 
        
         
         The sentencing judge erred by having insufficient regard to the applicant’s subjective case in reconsidering the initial sentences and imposing final sentence 
         . 
         
        
       
      
     20 In respect to this ground counsel for the appellant referred to passages in the remarks on sentence of 8 May 2001 and the remarks on sentence of 11 November 2002. In his remarks on sentence of 8 May 2001, his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Today I disregard some of the subjective features that may indicate that a more sympathetic sentence is appropriate, that there are very real prospects of him obtaining his rehabilitation as a result of this program. The reason I refrain from doing that is that in a while his Drug Court program will end and then the Court will know his real desire and ability to achieve rehabilitation.”  
         
        
       
      
     21 Counsel for the appellant then referred to paras 22 and 30 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence of 11 November 2002, which I have already quoted. 
      
       
      
     22 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that, inconsistently with the view his Honour had expressed in para 30 of his remarks of 11 November 2002 that in the final sentencing of the appellant the initial sentences ought to be significantly reduced, his Honour had not significantly reduced those sentences in determining the final sentences. The only changes his Honour had made to the initial sentences were to reduce the sentences for the two offences of breaking, entering and stealing from one year eight months two weeks to one year three months. In reconsidering the initial sentences, his Honour would have been required to take into consideration the forty-four days the appellant had spent in custody during the drug program for breaches of the program. If this period of approximately one and a half months was deducted, there was only a difference of about four months between the initial sentences and the final sentences for the offences of breaking, entering and stealing. 
      
       
      
     23 I do not consider the first ground of appeal should be upheld. In my opinion, the extent of the reduction his Honour made to the sentences for breaking, entering and stealing, which were the principal sentences, for the factors identified by his Honour in para 30 of his remarks on sentence of 11 November 2002 was within his Honour’s exercising discretion and, having regard to the quite short duration of both the initial sentences and the final sentences, the reduction his Honour made could be regarded as a significant reduction.  
      
       
        
       Ground 2  
        
         
         The sentencing judge erred in failing to give reasons for imposing fixed terms of imprisonment in relation to those sentences for which no non-parole period was specified 
         . 
         
        
       
      
     24 In setting the final sentences for the two offences of breaking, entering and stealing, his Honour did not set a non-parole period for either sentence and did not expressly state any reason for not setting a non-parole period. Counsel for the appellant referred to s 45(2) of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
     .  
      
       
      
     25 By virtue of s 45(4) of the  
     Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      the failure of his Honour to give reasons for not setting a non-parole period did not invalidate the sentence. 
      
       
      
     26 In my opinion, it is clear why his Honour did not set a non-parole period for the two sentences for breaking, entering and stealing. On 11 November 2002 his Honour, apart from setting final sentences for the original offences, was also sentencing the appellant for the further offences. For the further offence of taking and driving a conveyance, his Honour was imposing a sentence, which he was ordering to be served cumulatively on the final sentences for breaking, entering and stealing. For the sentence for the further offence his Honour set a non-parole period of only nine months, with a parole period of one year three months. In so dividing that sentence between a non-parole period and a parole period, his Honour had regard to the totality of the sentences he was imposing, both the final sentences for the original offences and the sentences for the further offences. I would not uphold the second ground of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3. 
        
        
         
         In reconsidering the initial sentences imposed by the Drug Court, the sentence judge erred by imposing fixed terms which represented the appropriate head sentences 
         . 
         
        
       
      
     27 The initial sentences for the offences of breaking, entering and stealing were both expressed to be sentences of one year eight months two weeks, without any non-parole periods being set. 
      
       
      
     28 It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that, when Judge Milson came to impose final sentences the term of one year eight months two weeks should have been regarded by his Honour as being a head sentence for which a non-parole period could have been set and not as being a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment. 
      
       
      
     29 It was said to be the practice in the Drug Court not to set a non-parole period when imposing an initial sentence, because the offender is about to undertake a drug program and the sentence is to be immediately suspended. 
      
       
      
     30 It was submitted that, if the initial sentence for each offence of breaking, entering and stealing of one year eight months and two weeks was regarded, as it should have been, as a head sentence, then, if a non-parole period had been set and the common practice had been followed of dividing the head sentence into a non-parole period and a parole period in the ratio of three to one, then the non-parole period would have been approximately 15 months. 
      
       
      
     31 The submission continued that if, in imposing final sentences for the two offences of breaking, entering and stealing, Judge Milson imposed fixed terms of imprisonment, as his Honour did, and his Honour based the final sentences on the initial sentences as adjusted, then the length of the fixed terms should have been based on the notional non-parole periods of the initial sentences and not on the full terms of the initial sentences. 
      
       
      
     32 Counsel for the appellant referred to a decision of Smart AJ in  
     R v Henare 
      [2003] NSWCCA 376, in which his Honour would appear to have upheld a similar submission (see in particular paragraph 18 of his Honour's judgment). 
      
       
      
     33 In my opinion, his Honour did err in the way submitted by counsel for the appellant and counsel for the Crown, on the hearing of this appeal, did not contend, or at least did not contend strongly, to the contrary. In my opinion, his Honour, in imposing final sentences for the original offences, should have regarded the initial sentences he had imposed as being head sentences and not as being fixed terms of imprisonment and, consequently, the fixed terms of imprisonment his Honour set in imposing final sentences should have borne a relationship to the notional non-parole periods of the initial sentences and not the full terms of the initial sentences. 
      
       
      
     34 However, counsel for the Crown submitted that, before I could allow the appeal against sentence, I would have to be of the opinion, in accordance with section 6(3) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     , that some other sentences less severe than those imposed by his Honour were warranted in law and should have been passed. It was submitted by counsel for the Crown that, in determining that question, I should take into account the very large number of offences for which final sentences were being imposed. It was submitted that the sentences which his Honour had imposed were very lenient and that the leniency of the sentences was increased by his Honour having made most of the sentences fully concurrent with each other. Counsel for the Crown referred to the decision of a three-judge bench of this Court in  
     R v Ebsworth 
      [2002] NSWCCA 465, especially at paragraphs 16 and 17, where the Chief Judge at Common Law, on an appeal against the severity of sentences passed in the Drug Court, said inter alia that, in order for the Court of Criminal Appeal to intervene, it would have to be satisfied that a lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been imposed, and his Honour referred to section 6(3) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     . 
      
       
      
     35 Counsel for the appellant submitted that, in assessing whether the sentences imposed by Judge Milson were lenient, it was important to take into account that the sentences his Honour imposed were imposed in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Local Court and his Honour was subject to the restrictions on the maximum penalties that can be imposed and the restrictions on the accumulating of sentences which apply in the Local Court. 
      
       
      
     36 In response to these submissions by counsel for the appellant, counsel for the Crown submitted that the sentences imposed by Judge Milson were lenient, even having regard to the restrictions on the sentences which can be imposed in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Local Court. 
      
       
      
     37 I have reached the conclusion that I should not form the opinion required by section 6(3) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     . In my opinion, the final sentences imposed by Judge Milson for the original offences, even after taking into account the matters Judge Milson was required to take into account under s 12 of the  
     Drug Court Act 
      and that Judge Milson was exercising the jurisdiction of the Local Court, were very lenient and no lesser sentences would be warranted in law. 
      
       
      
     38 The consequence of that conclusion is that I dismiss the appeal.

                Wednesday 3 March 2004 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
       
       Regina v Craig Andrew Merritt 
       
       
       
      Andrew Merritt pleaded guilty to three counts of murder. The three victims were his children, by different relationships. He seeks leave to appeal against the sentences of life imprisonment which were imposed on each count.  
      
     
     
      
      The issue on appeal is whether his Honour erred in concluding that he should impose a life sentence, pursuant to s 61 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999, in relation to each offence, and in concluding that there were no “subjective circumstances” which enabled, or required him, to impose any lesser sentence. 
      
     
     
      
      HELD 
      , per Wood CJ at CL (Tobias JA and Hidden J agreeing), granting leave to appeal and setting aside the sentences below: 
      
     
     
      
      1) Given its legislative history, and the course of the common law, section 61(1) of the 
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 should be given a purposive application:  
      Veen (No. 2) v The Queen 
       (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476;  
      Regina v Harris 
       (2000) 50 NSWLR 409;  
      Regina v Miles 
       [2002] NSWCCA 276 
        
      considered [46-51].  
      
      
     
      
       
        
        (a) The primary focus of the legislation is the extremity of the offender’s culpability. The section should be interpreted as requiring a sentence of life imprisonment if the culpability is so extreme that the community’s interest in  
        any combination 
         of “retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence” could only be met through the imposition of a life sentence: [42], [52]-[54] 
        
       
      
      
     
      
      2) The sentences were manifestly excessive. This case called for determinant sentences, albeit substantial sentences, not life sentences. [73], [77]  
        
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) Having regard to the desirability for consistency and predictability in sentencing, it was appropriate for reference to be made to the general sentencing patterns concerning offences of murder committed by a parent of his or her children, reflected in:  
        R v Velevski 
         NSWSC, Dunford J, 26 September 1997;  
        Regina v Park 
         NSWSC Sperling J, 3 August 2000;  
        Regina v Cikos 
         [2001] NSWSC 35;  
        Regina v Cheatham 
         [2001] NSWSC 580;  
        Regina v Folbigg 
         [2003] NSWSC 895;  
        Regina v Fraser 
         [2004] NSWSC 53. [63]-[65], [67] 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The sentencing judge placed undue significance on the inability of the applicant to explain his offences, and gave insufficient weight to his depressed state of mind at the time of their commission. [73] 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The mental state of the offender is always of considerable relevance for the assessment of the degree of objective culpability involved in his or her offence, even though that state may not have been of the nature, or of the degree, that would have provided a defence or excuse at law:  
          Regina v Israil 
           [2002] NSWCCA 255 per Spigelman CJ at [23];  
          Regina 
            
          v 
            
          Hill 
           [2003] NSWCCA 128, 
           Regina v Cheatham  
          NSWSC, Grove J, 6 July 2001; Regina v Fraser [2004] NSWSC 53, Howie J. [55]-[56] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) The applicant’s gravely serious objective criminality was tempered by the particular circumstances in which the crimes occurred, in particular his condition of depression. [71]-[72] 
        
       
       
        
        (d) 
          
        The applicant’s subjective circumstances were favourable: he was young, had a relatively minor prior criminal record, he demonstrated significant remorse and contrition, he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and he had favourable prospects of rehabilitation, and it was accepted that he did not present as an ongoing danger to the community. 
          
        [74]-[75] 
         
         
        (e) The sentences should be significant and partially cumulative upon the other. A concurrent sentencing order would not reflect the total criminality. [77], [79] 
         
         
        (f) A 25% reduction in sentence for the early pleas would not be appropriate, as it would result in a sentencing order that would be inadequate to reflect the very grave objective criminality involved, or the interests of the public:  
        Regina v Thomson and Houlton  
        (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [157] and [158].  
          
        [76] 
        
       
       
       
      3) The term of sentence in each case should be one of imprisonment for 24 years, with an effective overall accumulation of 10 years, amounting to a total sentence of imprisonment for 34 years, with an effective non-parole period of 27 years. 
       [77], [80] 
      
      
     
      
      HELD 
      , per Tobias JA, adding comment to Wood CJ at CL’s interpretation of s61(1) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999: 
       
       
      1) It would be a rare case where the total absence of one or more of the s 61(1) indicia of community interest (“retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence”) will still permit the relevant degree of satisfaction to be attained by the court for a life sentence to be mandated. It is only where the significance of those indicia, taken in combination, leads inevitably to the conclusion that the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest can  
      only 
       be met through the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life, that such a sentence must be imposed. [6]-[7]

     Regina v Craig Andrew Merritt 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Wood CJ at CL and with his Honour's reasons. I only wish to add a comment with respect to his Honour's interpretation of s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    2 In [42] of his judgment his Honour sets out four possible interpretations of the section. In adopting the third of those possibilities his Honour said: (at [52]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""…I can see no reason why the section should not apply, if the culpability is so extreme that any combination of the stated indicia would lead to the view that the only sentence that can be fixed is one of imprisonment for life"" 
        
       
      
    3 In the application of this test, it is possible (as his Honour illustrates in [53] of his judgment) that one or more of the statutory indicia may be of less significance than the other or others or that one or more of them may be inapplicable. This is so in the present case due to the absence of any finding by the trial judge of future dangerousness or need for future community protection. 
     
      
    4 Notwithstanding the absence of one or more of the statutory indicia, the presence and level of significance of the other or others may still lead to the conclusion that the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest can only be met through the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life. 
     
      
    5 Obviously, the absence of any one or more of those indicia will make it more difficult for a trial judge to reach the state of satisfaction required by the section before such a sentence is mandated (subject always to s 61(3)). This is particularly so as the trial judge must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the level of culpability is so extreme as to require the imposition of that sentence. 
     
      
    6 It would, I tend to think, be a rare case where the total absence of one or more of the indicia will still permit the relevant degree of satisfaction to be attained. On the other hand, as his Honour observes in [53] of his judgment, absence of the need for personal, as distinct from general, deterrence, is unlikely to influence the decision to any significant degree. 
     
      
    7 As his Honour also observes, it is the combination of the statutory indicia established on the evidence to which regard must be had. It is only where the significance of those indicia, taken in combination, leads inevitably to the conclusion that the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest can only be met through the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life, that such a sentence must be imposed. 
     
      
    8 WOOD CJ at CL: On 12 April 2002, the applicant pleaded guilty to three counts of murder. The offences were committed in the early hours of 2 September 2001, and the three victims were the applicant’s children, Jackson, Taylah and Mikaylah. The applicant was, at the time of those offences, aged 30 years. 
     
      
    9 On 4 December 2002 Greg James J sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment on each count, to date from 2 September 2001. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
    10 By reason of the nature of the offences of which the applicant stood convicted, it was necessary for his Honour to have regard to section 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and sections 21 and 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    11 S 19A of the Crimes Act provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        19A Punishment for murder 
         
        (1) A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to imprisonment for life. 
         
        (2) A person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person’s natural life. 
         
        (3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 21 (1) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  
        (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life)...” 
        
       
      
    12 Section 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        21 General power to reduce penalties 
         
        (1) If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term. 
         
        … 
         
        (4) The power conferred on a court by this section is not limited by any other provision of this Part. 
         
        (5) This section does not limit any discretion that the court has, apart from this section, in relation to the imposition of penalties.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    13 Section 61 of the last mentioned Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        61 Mandatory life sentences for certain offences 
         
        (1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. 
         
        … 
         
        (3) Nothing in subsection (1) affects section 21 (1).” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    14 Additionally, in sentencing the applicant it was necessary for his Honour to give consideration to two further provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which are of general application, namely s 21A and s 22(1). 
     
      
    15 S 21A of the Act, at the relevant time, provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) In determining the sentence to be imposed on an offender, a court must impose a sentence of a severity that is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) For that purpose, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) the nature and circumstances of the case, 
         
          
          (b) if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts – that course of conduct, 
           
          (c) the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence, including: 
           
            
            i) the age of the victim (particularly if the victim is very old or very young), and 
             
            ii) any physical or mental disability of the victim, and 
             
            iii) any vulnerability of the victim arising because of the nature of the victim’s occupation, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) the degree to which the offender has shown contrition for the offence: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            i) by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence, or 
            
           
          
         
         ii) in any other manner. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) the need to deter the offender or other persons from committing an offence of the same or a similar character, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) the need to protect the community from the offender,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) the need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (j) the prospect of rehabilitation of the offender.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The matters to be taken into account by a court under this section are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under this Act or any other law…” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    16 S 22(1) of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) In passing sentence for an offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty to the offence, a court must take into account: 
         
        (a) the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, and 
         
        (b) when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty, 
         
        and may accordingly impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed.” 
        
       
      
    17 In his remarks on sentence, after referring to s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        “57 Objectively speaking, these killings constitute criminality of the highest order and that criminality does not appear to be mitigated in any significant way by any subjective feature of the offender. These killings meet the criteria set out in s.61(1). True it is that he might have been depressed and suffering from feelings of self-doubt and frustration. True it is also that the offender may have ingested a substantial quantity of alcohol. But those matters provide no mitigating reason for his acting in the way he did to deprive his children of their lives. These are plainly crimes in the worst class of case ( 
        Ibbs v. The Queen  
        (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452) such that their particular features are of very great heinousness. I can see no facts mitigating the objective seriousness of the killings when applying the test set out in  
        Regina v. Twala  
        (CCA, unreported 4 November 1994).  
        
       
       
        
        58 In such cases, it is to be expected that the maximum penalty will be imposed ( 
        Harris  
        (supra [100]) and this because the level of culpability is so extreme as to displace the effect of mitigating subjective features ( 
        Harris  
        (supra [103]-[105]).” 
         
        
       
      
    18 His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        “63… 
         
         
        ... for crimes of this culpability applying the principles in  
        Pearce  
        (supra) and the totality principle, determinate sentences, even if partly concurrent, would be expected to give a total sentence of very great length, even approaching the expected period of custody involved in the life sentence although accompanied by a non-parole period.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    19 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “66 I have closely examined the numerous cases to which I have been referred and the views of other judges expressed in them. I have, however, concluded that the application of principle and law requires I hold that these are crimes in which ""the appalling objective circumstances completely overwhelm whatever subjective circumstances there may be which include the prospects of rehabilitation"" ( 
        Miles  
        (supra) at [203]), so that I am required on each charge to sentence the offender to life imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    20 It is now submitted that his Honour erred in concluding that he should impose a life sentence, pursuant to s 61 of the Act, in relation to each offence, and in concluding that there were no “subjective circumstances” which enabled, or required him, to impose any lesser sentence.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    21 The circumstances in which the murders occurred were recorded in an agreed statement of facts. They were summarised by his Honour as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “6 In each of the counts contained in the indictment and to which the offender has pleaded guilty, he stood charged with the murder of one his natural children. All of the murders were committed on 2 September 2001. Each victim was the child of the offender by a different partner.  
        
       
       
        
        7 The deceased were all very young children. At the time of their deaths, the deceased Jackson James Merritt was aged six years, Taylah Pringle was aged 11 months and Mikaylah [Merritt] was aged 11 weeks.  
        
       
       
        
        8 The children were staying with the offender overnight at his mother's home. He had custody of the children that weekend. The children were to spend the weekend with the offender and his family for Fathers' Day.  
        
       
       
        
        9 On the evening of Friday 31 August 2001, the children were bathed, fed and put into pyjamas. Taylah had fallen asleep by 7.30 pm. The offender put her into his mother's bed where she usually slept. He later put Mikaylah into bed in his sister's room and shortly thereafter put Jackson to bed. Taylah woke up and the offender brought her from the bedroom. There was a disagreement between the offender and his mother as to who would attend to the baby. 
        
       
       
        
        10 The offender apparently had consumed an amount of liquor. Accounts as to how much, to an extent, vary. At 12.08 am, he had an acrimonious telephone conversation with his aunt and following that conversation sent her a text message, ""Thank you & good bye!"". She did not reply to this message. About 1.30 am, he contacted his then current companion, who had been at the house earlier on the prior day, by a text message, ""Good Buy (sic)"" which was followed, when she did not respond, by a further text message, ""Good Buy (sic) from me, my son and my daughters"". Later, she received a further text message, ""Good bye till next life. I've always loved U and UR sons."". She replied, ""I still love you and your kids"".  
         
         
        11 She was awakened about 5.30 am after hearing noises in her house. The offender was kneeling at the side of her bed, he was shaking and crying. He said to her, ""I love you. I'm sorry and tell my mum that I am sorry."". He left the premises. She phoned the Merritt household later and a police officer spoke to her and she was later told of the death of the children.  
         
         
        12 When the offender's mother and sister, Kylie, woke on 2 September 2001, they discovered that the children were dead in the bed. Some days later, the offender's mother discovered Jackson's ""rat tail"", which was a feature of the young boy's hairstyle, which the offender had wished him to cut off for some time, had been removed.  
         
         
        13 At about 8.08 am on 2 September 2001, the offender attended Parramatta Police Station and informed the probationary constable then on duty, ""I've just put my kids to sleep"". When asked what he meant by that, he said, ""I mean I've put them to sleep permanently ... if you do not take me I'll walk out the door ... don't leave me here or I'll walk out the door"". He was spoken to by senior police to whom he repeated that he had put his children to sleep. The smell of alcohol was noted on his breath. He was taken into custody and seen by a legal aid solicitor. 
         
         
        14 Subsequently, he was charged with the offences.  
         
         
        15 The bodies of the children were discovered lying on the bed in the mother's premises alongside each other dressed in night clothes with no major injuries apparent. Jackson and Taylah were discovered, on post mortem, to have died from mechanical asphyxia consistent with suffocation. A definitive diagnosis was unable to be made in the case of Mikaylah. However, given the circumstances of the discovery and the admissions made by the offender, it is plain that all three children had been suffocated by him.” 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour additionally observed, concerning his relationship with the children, and with their mothers (Jenny Green (Mikaylah), Nicole O’Loughlin (Jackson), and Melanie Pringle (Taylah)): 
     
      
       
        
        “17 Although the offender had had a tempestuous domestic background with the three mothers of the deceased children, partly explicable, on their accounts, by his emotionalism and possibly by his having problems with drinking and gambling, it seems that, overall, his relations with his former partners were, as far as his access to the children of each of his previous relationships was concerned, reasonably amicable. It appears that the mothers of the deceased children and the various friends and relatives who were aware of the offender's relationship with those children, were all of the view that prior to the killings, the offender had a good and loving relationship with his children. There is no suggestion of any history of aggression towards the children nor of any act of abuse. Nor is there any suggestion that at any time he was otherwise irresponsible in respect of the children.  
         
         
        18 He seemed to be a person who was concerned to have an amicable family relationship, but was unable to maintain a steady relationship with a partner. There had been times at which he had disagreed with his partners and his mother concerning the children, claiming an ability to take care of his children, notwithstanding some criticism of his life choices.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    23 Of importance to his Honour, in deciding that the case was one to which s 61(1) applied, was the absence of any apparent reason for the commission of the three murders. It is that aspect upon which the applicant principally concentrated in the appeal, submitting that his Honour failed to pay proper regard to the evidence of Dr Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist who had examined the applicant, or to certain background events which had occurred on the preceding day, that is, Saturday 1 September. 
     
      
    24 The applicant gave evidence during the sentencing proceedings. As his Honour noted at [39], he: 
     
      
       
        
        “… claimed to have been happy that evening with all three children. He claimed no memory of any disagreement with his aunt or his then current partner, nor any recollection of how much alcohol he had consumed, nor any discussions with his mother. In evidence, there occurred the following questions and answers:-  
         
          
           
          ‘Q. Mr. Merritt, do you know what your state of mind was at the time that you killed your children? A. No.  
           
           
          Q. Can you offer any explanation as to why you killed your children? A. No.  
           
           
          Q. You have been in custody now for some time? A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. Have you thought about what in fact had happened? A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. Have you attempted to get some understanding of what your state of mind was at the time? A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. What do you believe your state of mind was? A. That I was upset. I was just bottling things up all the time.  
           
           
          Q. What were you bottling up? A. Everything, not being able to see my children all the time, losing my job, my car.  
           
          HIS HONOUR: Q. Sorry, what about the car? What happened about the car? A. I had an accident in my car and lost it.  
           
           
          ...  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. The disapproval of your aunt? A. Yes, sorry.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ZAHRA: Q. What do you think affected you about that? A. Previously I had spoken to her on the phone and asked her when she would next be in Sydney, if she wanted to see my kids and we ended up having an argument on the phone and that made me feel really bad and I thought, 'What's happening? All I want to try and do is be a good father and - and nothing seems to work'.  
          
         
         
          
          HIS HONOUR: Q. Was there some discussion concerning being a failure as a father? A. To the point where she - she turned around and she got angry with me or explained to me that it's not good to - to be a father of three children to three different mothers. I should be more like a normal family and have three children to one mother.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    25 Additionally, his Honour noted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “40 The offender gave evidence that when he had to take the kids home (from the exercise by him of access):-  
         
         
          
          ‘I would think, 'What have I done wrong? Why - why can't I have my children every day? Why can't I be a normal father, be able to see - wake up with my children, go to sleep with my children, more than once a fortnight'.""  
          
         
        
       
      
    26 The reference to losing his job was to the loss of his licence and job as a security guard, which had followed upon a conviction for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Otherwise his criminal record was short and of a minor nature. 
     
      
    27 His Honour noted, in relation to the applicant’s initial presentation to Dr Allnutt, that he had denied any recollection of having any disturbance in mood, unusual thoughts or perceptions, and that he had also denied any thoughts of harming the children. He had no recollection of what had occurred between the time of bathing the children and the following morning. In summary, he had been unable to provide to Dr Allnutt any account of how the offences occurred, or of his motivation. 
     
      
    28 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “28 Dr. Allnutt diagnosed him initially as suffering from a chronic, fluctuating, depressed mood which had its initial onset in late 2000. There was no psychotic disorder nor major depressive disorder. Dr. Allnutt characterised the offender's condition as a chronic adjustment disorder, which is characterised by a fluctuating, depressed mood disturbance with associated difficulties in sleep, appetite, concentration and motivation. There was no evidence that he suffered from either a mental illness or mental disorder. The doctor thought that it was unlikely that he was feigning amnesia, since he accepted, although not remembering it, what it was he had done.” 
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
      
    29 In a later report, his Honour noted, Dr Allnutt had been informed by the applicant that he still had no memory of the offence, or recollection of any high emotion between himself and his mother, or between himself and his aunt, in the early hours of the morning. Dr Allnutt noted that he was not manifesting any significant disturbances suggestive of any underlying neurological disease, or of a psychosis. However, he had reported having had suicidal thoughts and being depressed in mood, and gave the impression of not caring about the outcome of the sentencing proceedings, accepting that whether in or out of gaol, he would be punished for the rest of his life.  
     
      
    30 His Honour summarised the effect of Dr Allnutt’s opinion in the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “31 Dr. Allnutt noted that the offence appeared to have no explanation. He referred to the most striking feature of the case as the contradiction between the offender's admission of guilt from the outset, his voluntarily handing himself into the police, pleading guilty and a desiring acceptance of even the most severe punishment, and, on the other hand, his absence of any account of what he had done to commit the offence.  
         
         
        32 Dr. Allnutt hypothesised that there was a genuine inability to recall the crime by reason of psychogenic amnesia arising out of the emotional response to an extreme stress arising from the crime. As I understand it, that is, he feels guilty and deserving of the maximum penalty so adopts a psychological mechanism of choosing a severe punishment rather than seeking to remember, admit or justify his behaviour.  
         
         
        33 Dr. Allnutt postulated that it was possible that he had feelings of unworthiness and frustration as a father on the day of the offence and says:-  
         
         
          
          ‘Having regard to the text messages, I believe it would be reasonable to conclude that, at the material time of the offence, he had developed both homicidal and suicidal thoughts in the context of a depressed and irritable mood; and an emotional state of mind’.  
          
         
         
        34 Dr. Allnutt pointed to the presence, at the material time, of depressive symptoms and feelings of anger and frustration. He said:-  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It is also possible that the offence itself was triggered by a transient, yet pessimistic and despairing perception of his circumstances and possible alcohol consumption.’ 
          
         
         
        35 He said:-  
         
         
          
          ‘Overall, notwithstanding that Mr. Merritt has committed an horrific crime, in my view, he can be regarded as falling into a low risk group of offenders for future re-offending.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    31 In his evidence during the sentencing proceedings, Dr Allnutt confirmed those views, and observed that he had no doubt that the appellant was telling the truth when he said that he could not talk about the killings. As his Honour also noted at [42]: 
     
      
       
        
        “When asked about the ability of a person suffering from such a depressed mood to control their actions when evidencing increased irritability, he pointed out that ""you do not lose your ability to control your actions, but you may be more likely to respond impulsively to something"". He referred to the ingestion of alcohol as tending to aggravate negative emotions and the offender seeing matters in more negative terms and behaving in a more impulsive way.” 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour further noted that:  
     
      
       
        
        “43 The doctor was cross-examined by the Crown concerning the doctor having spoken to the offender now a number of times over a lengthy period of time and having made enquiries amongst the offender's friends and family. The following question and answer were given in evidence:-  
         
          
           
          ‘Q. None of them could shed any light upon what led him to commit these acts? A. No.  
           
          HIS HONOUR: Q. And I gather, Dr. Allnutt, you can't either? A. I am very limited in the ability that I can shed light in this case, your Honour.  
           
          Q. You have referred to matters that might, in combination, potentially have produced such a depressive mood as might have been one of the factors responsible? A. That's correct.  
           
          Q. That is about as far as you can go? A. Yes, that's correct.’” 
          
         
         
        
       
      
    33 It was upon this basis that his Honour found at [44] that he was: 
     
      
       
        
        “left, therefore, with very little information on which to attempt to draw any conclusion as to why the offender acted in the way in which he did to commit these abominable crimes.” 
        
       
       
      
    34 He did however accept, as was conceded by the Crown, that there was no evidence “as would affirmatively establish future dangerousness” on the applicant’s part, that he should be regarded as having pleaded guilty to the offences “at the earliest possible occasion”, and that he had manifested “a high degree of contrition and remorse”. He was sentenced upon the basis that he had intended to kill each of the children.  
     
      
       
      The Relevant Principles Concerning the Application of s 61(1) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       
      
    35 Before turning to the applicant's submissions, it is convenient to note that the burden of proving that a case falls within s 61(1) of the Act rests on the Crown, and that, in accordance with the decision in Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270, the standard of such proof is beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    36 There is an obvious tension between the apparent mandatory requirement to impose a life sentence where a case falls within s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and s 61(3), which preserves the s 21(1) discretion to impose a lesser sentence. That tension was recognised in decisions such as Regina v Petrinovic [1999] NSWSC 1131, and also in Regina v Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409. It has been resolved in favour of recognising the continued existence of the discretion, notwithstanding the fact that the s 61(1) criteria are met, where the offender’s subjective circumstances justify a lesser sentence than one of life imprisonment. 
     
      
    37 His Honour recognised the two step process, including the discretion, which has been followed in the application of s 61, and which was recognised in Regina v Harris and in Regina v Miles [2002] NSWCCA 276.  
     
      
    38 This Court in Regina v Harris gave consideration to the kind of conduct that would meet the s 61(1) criterion, and to the Crown submission that there were two separate avenues for the imposition of life sentences, namely, that recognised at common law (Ibbs v The Queen  (1987) 163 CLR 447), and that arising under s 61.39 I observed, with the approval of Giles JA and James J: 
     
      
       
        
        “84 The features required for qualification in the ""worst case category"" were defined in  
        R v Twala 
         (NSWCCA 4 November 1994, unreported) where it was said: 
         
          
           
          ‘in order to characterise any case as being in the  
          worst case 
           category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the  
          seriousness 
           of the crime (as distinct from the subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)…’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        85 ""Heinousness"" has been described as follows [in  
        R v Arthurell 
         (Hunt CJ at CL, 3 October 1997, unreported) at 11]: 
         
          
           
          ‘The adjective ‘heinous’ which gives the noun ‘heinousness’ its meaning has been variously defined as meaning atrocious, detestable, hateful, odious, gravely reprehensible and extremely wicked. The test to be satisfied is thus a substantial one’.  
           
          
         
        86 It was next submitted that the exercise required at common law differed from an assessment of the level of ""culpability"" under S 61(1) of the Procedure Act, which required a consideration of the reasons for the offending conduct, ie of the circumstances surrounding or causally connected with the offence, such as the background or mental state of the offender. 
         
         
        87 It is not at all clear to me that the assessment whether a case falls within the ""worst case category"" at common law is any different from that postulated under S 61(1). The decision in  
        Veen (No2) 
          
        (1987) 164 CLR 465 
        , permits reference at common law to background material for the purpose of assessing moral culpability, and dangerous propensity and there is long standing precedent for regard to be had to each of the matters specified in S 61(1) when considering sentence.” 
         
        
       
      
    40 Harris also stands as authority for the principle that where there are multiple killings, that circumstance can be taken into account when assessing the level of the offender’s culpability. I observed, in this regard: 
     
      
       
        
        “94 So far as the present case is concerned, it appears to me to have been permissible for Bell J, without having to depend upon the common law, to have had regard to the other murders when assessing the level of culpability of each in the application of S 61(1) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         and in particular, whether the case was one calling for a life sentence in terms of S 61(1), and then whether, in the exercise of her discretion under S 21(1), a lesser sentence of imprisonment for a specified term could be imposed. 
         
         
        95 Particularly was this so in the context of a case where the three killings occurred in quick proximity, and where the last two were similarly motivated and encouraged by the success of the respondent in carrying out and initially escaping both suspicion and detection for the first of those offences.” 
         
        
       
      
    41 During the hearing of the appeal, a question of statutory interpretation arose as to whether a sentencing judge must be satisfied, before passing a life sentence, of the presence of each of the four indicia referred to in 61(1); that is, that the culpability was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence, could only be met through the imposition of a life sentence.  
     
      
    42 Several possible interpretations of the section exist (subject to s 61(3)): 
     
      
       
      (a) First, that a life sentence is required, if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest, in  
      any one 
       of the four indicia, is such that it could only be met by such a sentence; 
       
       
      (b) Second, that such a sentence is only required if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest, in 
       each 
       of the four indicia, is such that it could only be met by such a sentence; and 
       
       
      (c) Third, that such a sentence is required if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest, in the  
      combined effect 
       of such of the four indicia as are applicable, could only be met by such a sentence (a construction which would embrace a circumstance where any one or more of those factors may be of itself insufficient, or inapplicable).  
       
       
      (d) Fourth, a variation of the third construction, that such a sentence is only required where the culpability is so extreme that the combined effect of the four indicia, with  
      each contributing 
       to some degree, is such that it could only be met by such a sentence.  
       
      
    43 The drafting of the section is less than perfect in so far as it is by no means clear whether the legislature intended that a distributive or cumulative interpretation should be given to the relevant indicia, cf the cases discussed in Regina v Monroe (2003) 56 NSWLR 652 at 656 to 658. It is further complicated by the circumstance that there is a considerable overlap between each of the four indicia, particularly those of retribution and punishment, and those of community protection and deterrence.  
     
      
    44 It was the applicant’s submission that the second of the four interpretations should be adopted; while, in substance, the Crown favoured the third interpretation.  
     
      
    45 The question arose specifically in the absence of any finding in this case, of material pointing to the kind of future dangerousness that would be relevant to the factor of community protection. 46 The legislative history provides some assistance in relation to the question that has arisen.  
     
      
    47 Section 61(1) derived from s 431B of the Crimes Act 1900, which was incorporated into that Act by the enactment of the Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Act 1996. In his second reading speech on the Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Bill on 17 April 1996 (at Hansard p. 84-85), the Attorney General, the Hon JW Shaw QC (as he then was) stated, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I said when introducing of the Bill in 1995, the Court of Criminal Appeal in this State has affirmed the imposition of a life sentence when the level of culpability for the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment demands it. This Government agrees with that principle. We would add to this formulation that the community interest in its own protection and deterrence of others is a relevant consideration. These are all well-understood and commonly applied sentencing principles which, given statutory expression, will provide further legislative authority to our courts to impose a punishment commensurate with the crime. It will mandate a life sentence for those offences to which the legislation applies and leave the community in no doubt of the government's intention to remain tough on crime."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    48 During his speech, in reply to the debate on the earlier Bill (which for all practical purposes was in the same terms) on 11 October 1995, the Attorney General stated (at Hansard p 1515-1516) inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It has been said that this bill will make little or no practical difference to the present law with respect to the crime of murder. However, the bill expands upon and codifies a sentencing principle which was articulated by the Chief Justice of New South Wales in the Supreme Court in the matter of Garforth. This principle was outlined in a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 23 May 1994. In rejecting Garforth's appeal his Honour referred to those offences which demonstrated an extreme degree of culpability, such that the community interest in retribution and punishment can be met only through the imposition of the maximum penalty. The provisions of the Bill add to that formulation of an acknowledged sentencing principle by the inclusion of community protection and deterrence as relevant factors.  
         
         
        The elevation of a common law principle into legislation gives statutory expression to the will of the Parliament, and in that sense it strengthens the application of those principles in appropriate cases. In the absence of legislation, the application of common law principles remains a matter of precedent which is capable of being overruled on appeal to a higher court. Moreover, legislation, as opposed to the common law, is accessible to and therefore capable of being more readily understood by the wider community."" 
        
       
      
    49 That the legislation had the effect of codifying the common law reflects the view of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales in its Discussion Paper 33 on Sentencing (April 1996) and in its Report 79 on Sentencing. It would be surprising, in view of the terms of the speeches recorded in Hansard, if the legislation was to have the effect of narrowing the common law, as stated in Regina v Garforth (NSWCCA 23/05/94 unreported).50 That the provision should be given a purposive application, which, in my view, would more properly accord with the third of the possible interpretations, also gains some support in the following observations by Mason CJ, and Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ, in Veen (No. 2) v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476: 
     
      
       
        
        ""However, sentencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    51 A purposive application is additionally supported by the acceptance in Regina v Harris and it would seem in Regina v Miles, that the s 61 test broadly accords with the common law approach.52 In my assessment, the primary focus of the legislation is directed towards how extreme the offender's culpability is. Both Harris and Miles, and the various decisions that have led to life sentences, have emphasised the importance of this factor, and for the need for the court to find features of very great heinousness, along with the absence of any facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime. In these circumstances, I can see no reason why the section should not apply, if the culpability is so extreme that any combination of the stated indicia would lead to the view that the only sentence, that can be passed, is one of imprisonment for life.53 While in most cases of extreme heinousness each of the relevant elements will be present to some degree, it is unlikely that they will be present to the same degree. For example, that might be so in the case of an offender who has a significant mental condition, which renders him of very great continuing dangerousness, but in whose case, in accordance with established sentencing principle, the element of personal deterrence may be of limited importance.54 In these circumstances I am not persuaded that the applicant's submission, as to the proper interpretation of the provision, is correct. To the contrary, I would adopt the third of the possible interpretations. It follows that the absence of any finding of future dangerousness would not rule out an application of the section.55 Before returning to the applicant’s challenge to the sentence, I observe that the mental state of the offender is always of considerable relevance for the assessment of the degree of objective culpability involved in his or her offence, even though that state may not have been of the nature, or of the degree, that would have provided a defence or excuse at law. In Regina v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255, Spigelman CJ observed (at para 23): 
     
      
       
        
        “23. To the extent that mental illness explains the offence – as her Honour found to be the position in the present case – then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in  
        Henry  
        (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, at [254]: 
         
          
           
          ‘… the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing.’” 
          
         
          
        
       
      
    56 That considerations of this kind have proved decisive in other cases of multiple murder, and have led to determinant sentences being imposed, rather than life sentences, can be seen in decisions such as Regina v Hill [2003] NSWCCA 128, Regina v Cheatham NSWSC, Grove J, 6 July 2001, and Regina v Fraser [2004] NSWSC 53, Howie J. 
     
      
      Were the Sentences Manifestly Excessive? 
       
      
    57 The applicant relied upon a number of matters in addition to those noted by his Honour in his summary of the facts, as showing that his level of culpability was reduced below that which would justify life sentences. In particular, attention was drawn to the material which had been placed before his Honour (it would appear somewhat informally) from: 
     
      
      (a)  
      Sally-Ann Frary 
      , the partner of the applicant, to the effect that, after Jackson had been picked up from the home of his mother, and taken back to the premises where they lived, on Friday, he had informed the applicant that he had forgotten to buy him a Father's Day present, although he had purchased one for his mother's current partner, Justin; 
       
       
      (b)  
      Sandra Merritt 
      , the applicant's mother, to the effect that: 
       
        
         
        (i) on the Friday he had remarked that Jackson had been a bit upset about not having a Father's Day present for him, and had asked whether she could take him shopping in the morning; 
         
        (ii) on the Saturday night, when the question of the absence of a Father's Day present was again mentioned, the applicant seemed upset, to have had tears in his eyes, and to have reminded Jackson that he, and not Justin, was his father; 
         
        (iii) after the children were put to bed that night, the applicant, who appeared to be a little emotional and teary, had asked her whether he was ""a failure""; and that later he had insisted, with a degree of firmness, on changing Taylah’s nappy; 
         
        (iv) the applicant had informed her that his aunt Lyn, with whom he normally had a close relationship, had been ""giving him a hard time about having three children to three mothers, and that he should be (more) responsible"". 
        
       
       
      (c)  
      Caroline Cowan 
      , otherwise referred to as “aunty Lyn”, to the effect that: 
       
        
        (i) she had spoken to the applicant on Saturday 30 June, in the course of which she had indicated that she was not happy about him having had children to different mothers, and had observed that this was ""not the way the family unit was supposed to be"", and that in response he had been somewhat angry and abusive; 
         
        (ii) shortly after midnight, on 2 September, she had been phoned by the applicant's mother and had then spoken to both of them about the applicant’s apparent distress that she had been visiting Sydney for three weeks, yet had not been over to see his children; and that he had been abusive towards her during the conversation, describing her as a “loser”, and as “having taken sides”; 
         
        (iii) it was after this that she had received the 2.02.34 text message previously mentioned. 
        
       
       
      (d)  
      Nicole O’Loughlin 
      , the mother of Jackson, to the effect that, following their separation in 1997, there had been a number of disputes between them concerning the applicant’s access to Jackson, and concerning some occasions when he had not returned the child, in accordance with the terms of the Family Court orders, or her request.  
       
       
      (e)  
      Melanie Pringle 
      , the mother of Taylah, to the effect that there had been some occasions when he had kept the girl for longer than the agreed period of access, and an occasion when there was a falling out between them, as a result of his complaint that she was a bad mother; 
       
       
      (f)  
      Jennifer Green 
      , the mother of Mikaylah, to the effect that while she had not experienced any problems in relation to the applicant's access to her child, and regarded him as a ""good dad"", she did recall him becoming very depressed and angry in relation to his custody/access battles concerning Jackson, and him saying ""I thought about taking Jackson's life and my life but then I think, why should he suffer because it's not his fault."" 
       
       
      (g)  
      Jocelyn Duckett 
       to the effect that the applicant had been showing concern about his relationship with Jackson, that this seemed to be consuming him, that he had spoken of ""taking off"" with him, that he had seemed to be distraught that he could not be with him, and that, on the occasions when this topic was discussed, he was visibly upset and emotional. 
       
      
    58 In addition to the evidence from Dr Allnutt, which was summarised by his Honour in the passages earlier cited, it was the case that this witness directed himself as to the possible reasons for the applicant's apparently inexplicable behaviour, in killing three children for whom he seemed to have a great deal of love, in so far as he observed in his report of 25 May 2002: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Ultimately his reasoning and motives at the time remain unknown to me. However, there is no evidence to suggest that: the children were unwanted; that there had been a highly aggressive emotive interchange with the children; that the children were innocent bystanders; that the killing was motivated by euthanasia, sexual or physical abuse, an attempt to evade detection, neglect or due to sadistic intent. Revenge as motivation needs to be considered given his report of resentful feelings; but there is relatively little evidence of this. On balance the most likely possible motive is that the homicides were part of a homicide/suicide (that he did not complete) occurring in the context of an unrecognised depression, alcohol consumption and significant emotional stress. It is possible to speculate that just preceding the offence he saw his circumstances in unrealistic despairing terms derived from a depressed emotional and pessimistic state of mind. 
         
         
        In summary, this is an unpredicted and likely spontaneous homicide of three children by their biological father. It was preceded by conflicts about the custody of at least one of the children and depressive symptoms suffered by your client. The weight of the evidence supports the presence, at the material time of the offence, of depressive symptoms, feelings of anger and frustration."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    59 In his evidence he confirmed that the applicant had presented with what could be diagnosed as ""a chronic adjustment disorder"", which was likely to have had its onset in late 2000. He also said that he thought the applicant's understanding of his emotional state, and his appreciation of what he might have been experiencing emotionally, was “limited”. 60 The position of this Court, in considering an appeal from such a sentence, is limited by the fact that it is a court of error: Regina v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351. It is not sufficient for it to find that some other sentence might possibly have been imposed, or that members of the Court might have themselves imposed a different sentence: Skinner v The Queen (1913) 16 CLR 336 and Regina v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397. Rather, it must be satisfied that the sentence was wrong, and that some other sentence was warranted and should have been imposed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act, and see Regina v Cocking [1999] NSWCCA 311.  
     
      
    61 This will require it to be satisfied that there was an error of principle, or a mistake of fact or law, such that the sentencing discretion of the trial judge miscarried. In its review, the Court is also bound by findings of fact by the sentencing judge unless they were not open on the evidence, or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The Queen (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505, Regina v Kelly (1993) 30 NSWLR 64 and Regina v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505.  
     
      
    62 Additionally, while it is appropriate for the Court to correct a sentence which is out of line with the commonly accepted pattern: Regina v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104, there is limited utility in drawing any direct comparison with a sentence imposed upon another offender, simply because the two offenders appear to have similar characteristics, or to have committed similar crimes. What must be considered is whether the sentence is within the appropriate range, and in that respect, other apparently similar cases merely form part of that range: Regina v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 and Regina v Salameh NSWCCA 9 June 1994. 63 Both before his Honour, and on appeal, the applicant did however place reliance upon a submission that life sentences, for the present offences, would fall outside the commonly accepted pattern of sentencing for cases where a parent has killed his or her children. Attention was drawn to: 
     
      
      (a)  
      Regina v Velevski 
       NSWSC, Dunford J, 26 September 1997, where the offender was sentenced following conviction after trial, to a head sentence of 25 years with a minimum term of 19 years, and an additional term of six years, for the murder of his wife, his six-year-old daughter and three-month-old twins, in circumstances involving a considerable degree of planning, and where there were defence wounds to the victims indicative of a struggle; 
       
       
      (b)  
      Regina v Park 
       NSWSC Sperling J, 3 August 2000, where the offender was sentenced, following conviction after trial, to an overall term of 26 years, with a non-parole period of 19 years and 6 months, for the murder of his wife and two children aged 3 years 6 months and 2 years 6 months, in circumstances where he was found to have acted in a highly charged emotional state, where he had disposed of the bodies, and where he attempted to avoid justice. An appeal against leniency was dismissed by majority, although Hidden J, with whom James J agreed, in dismissing the appeal, respectively observed that it would have been ""open to the sentencing judge to have imposed a heavier sentence"", and that the sentences were ""lenient"":  
      Regina v Park  
      [2003] NSWCCA 142; 
       
       
      (c)  
      Regina v Cikos 
       [2001] NSWSC 35, where the offender was sentenced, after a plea of guilty, to imprisonment for 21 years with a non parole period of 15 years and 6 months, for the murder of his de facto partner, and his sons, aged four years and eighteen months, in circumstances where he had endured months of aggression, including physical and verbal abuse at the hands of his obsessive and dominant partner, and had reacted to her ultimatum that he kill one of her friends, or be killed himself, and where there was evidence of concealment of the victims; 
       
       
      (d)  
      Regina v Cheatham 
       [2001] NSWSC 580 where the offender was sentenced, after a retrial, to an overall term of 24 years with a non parole period of 16 years, for the murder of his wife and three year old daughter, and for wounding with intent to murder his baby daughter, in circumstances where he had been depressed and suffering from a delusion that he was infected with AIDS and where, after committing the respective offences, he had attempted to kill himself. On appeal this sentence was reduced by majority to 22 years with a non-parole period of 14 years, because of what was considered to have been an inadequate allowance for the need for the sentence to be served on protection:  
      R v Cheatham 
       [2002] NSWCCA 360. 
      
    64 To these decisions can now be added two recent decisions at first instance:  
     
      
      (a) Regina v Folbigg 
       [2003] NSWSC 895 where, after trial, the offender was sentenced to an overall term of 40 years, with an effective non-parole period of 30 years, for the murder of three of her children, for the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm to one of those children, and for the manslaughter of a fourth child, in circumstances where the offences, which were unpremeditated, had occurred over a period of ten years, and where there was psychiatric opinion, post conviction, to suggest that she had been a depressed and psychologically damaged person, due to her disturbed and dysfunctional childhood, who had been unable properly to bond with her own children, or to understand her condition.  
       
       
      (b)  
      Regina v Fraser 
       [2004] NSWSC 53, where, after trial, the offender was sentenced to an overall term of 32 years, with a non parole period of 27 years, for the planned murder of his three children, aged seven years, five years and four years, in circumstances where he was in a highly emotional state due to his fears of losing his children and of harm occurring to them as the result of his wife having formed a new relationship, where, after the offences, he had tried to kill himself, and where he had planned a gruesome scene for his wife to discover on entering his unit; but where it was accepted that he had been in a highly disturbed and disordered mental state at the time of the killings, and in the days leading up to them, and that he had a long standing history of psychiatric disturbances.  
      
    65 It is true that these were all cases in which determinant sentences, including the setting of non-parole periods, were imposed. There has in fact been no decision in this State, so far as I am aware, involving the murder by a parent of his or her children, where life sentences have been imposed, other than the present case. That is a circumstance that can, in my view, properly be taken into account, having regard to the desirability for general consistency and predictability in sentencing. To so hold is not to offend against the principles considered in Veen (No 2) v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 465 or Regina v Twala NSWCCA 4 November 1994, and see also Regina v Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at 51, which make it clear that it is an incorrect approach to sentencing to compare the facts of the case at hand with other cases in order to determine whether it does or does not fall within the worst case category, deserving of the maximum sentence.66 A brief review of some of the cases where life sentences have, in fact, been imposed for cases of murder, was undertaken by me in the reasons for sentence which I delivered in Regina v Penisini [2003] NSWSC 892. They display somewhat different characteristics, and in particular were either wholly, or in the main, cases of extreme violence, where the offender's psychiatric or emotional state either did not contribute to the offence, or had very limited significance; or where his or her future dangerousness to the community was demonstrably evident. Some were cases of underworld murders, one involved a political killing; all were cases which involved a significant threat to society and a need for a strong element of personal and general deterrence. Little purpose is, accordingly, to be derived by further reference to them. 67 As I have observed, reference to the decisions that I have expressly cited is appropriate, so long as they are understood to form part of an overall sentencing pattern. Ultimately each case must be determined upon its own facts, and by reference to the legislative provisions, which set the available maximum, or which otherwise give direction as to the sentence which is to be imposed. 68 From these provisions is to be discerned the intention of the legislature, and the seriousness with which the community regards the offence. They set the appropriate framework for the sentencing exercise: Regina v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174. Otherwise, as Howie J observed in Regina v Fraser at [72] ""individual sentences do not form some benchmark against which some other sentence is to be evaluated."" 69 Obviously, the murder of three very young, vulnerable, innocent, and entirely defenceless children, while they were asleep, by their father, involves the grossest breach of trust imaginable. Left unexplained, or unmitigated by circumstances personal to the offender which might provide some reason for his resort to such extreme violence, or where accompanied by deliberate cruelty and suffering to the children, such a case could properly fall within the ambit of s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and, as such, justify life sentences.70 There can be little doubt, in my view, that the offences arose out of the applicant's frustration and depression concerning the access issues, in particular to a degree of obsession in relation to Jackson, and also out of an awareness of, or concern as to, his inadequacies as a father. To some extent, it would seem that he was also affected by alcohol, although there was no suggestion that he had deliberately set out to drink in order to carry out the offences; rather that he had done so in order to cope with his depressed mood.  71 His decision to kill the children can only be categorised as having been self-centred and extremely selfish. It means that the offences, which obviously involved willed and intentional acts of multiple murder, were gravely serious from an objective point of view. Nevertheless, that objective criminality should, in my view, be regarded as tempered by the following circumstances:  
     
      
       
      (a) The acts were clearly neither planned nor expected, but spontaneous and impulsive; 
       
      (b) They did not occur against a background of abuse or violence, and they were unaccompanied by any act or acts that involved the infliction of gratuitous cruelty, or that prolonged the suffering of the children; 
       
      (c) They were not carried out for the sexual gratification of the applicant; 
       
      (d) They were committed in circumstances where the applicant was in a state of depression, or at least in a significantly depressed mood, and they involved conduct which was dramatically different from the normal loving relationship which he had with the children, and, indeed, from his own behaviour during the preceding day; 
       
      (e) There was no attempt to conceal the offences, and the applicant accepted his guilt from the outset; 
       
      (f) The applicant had no prior history of similar violence towards his, or any other children, and there was no evidence that would suggest any likelihood of him reoffending in a similar manner, particularly having regard to the time that he might properly be expected to remain in custody, before being eligible for release on parole, in the event of appropriate determinant sentences being imposed. 
       
      
    72 Moreover, the case is one in which the senseless, and self destructive, events of 2 September have led to the infliction of considerable punishment upon the applicant, in so far as they resulted in his own loss of children for whom he had a deep and abiding affection. That is not to minimise or to overlook, so far as it is relevant, in accordance with accepted sentencing practice, the fact that the consequences for the innocent mothers of the three children have been even more appalling and undeserved by them.73 Having regard to the events leading up to the tragic deaths during the early hours of 2 September, to the entirety of Dr Allnutt's evidence, and to the matters just outlined, it appears to me that his Honour placed undue significance on the inability of the applicant to explain himself, and gave insufficient weight to his state of mind, which, Dr Allnutt considered, amounted to a chronic adjustment disorder with a depressed mood. While that condition did not provide a qualified defence, or excuse, for the killings, and while the circumstances of the case do approach those that would attract an application of s 61(1), it is my view that this case called for determinant sentences, albeit substantial sentences, and that, in this respect error has been shown. I would accordingly grant leave to appeal. 74 In these circumstances, it is appropriate for reference to be made to the applicant's subjective circumstances, as well as to a further report from Dr Allnutt, which followed an interview with the applicant on 12 November 2003. While adhering to his earlier opinion, Dr Allnutt offered the following additional observations and opinions: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Your client had a persistent depressive disorder over a lengthy period of time that caused fluctuations in his mood. He felt depressed about his circumstances to the extent that he lost his appetite and lost weight, he had difficulty concentrating because he was preoccupied with his son, he became withdrawn socially and lost interest in activities that he used to enjoy, at times he felt that there was not point in living and when feeling hopeless in this way, he thought about suicide. It is likely that he felt worse on some days and better on others. Overall his limited contact with his son preoccupied his thoughts significantly. The depressive symptoms impacted on his social and occupational functioning to a greater extent than would be expected by someone suffering common stress. He thus suffered a depressive disorder, which was active at the material time of the offence. 
         
         
        People who have depressive symptoms are more prone to have negative and pessimistic thoughts about themselves and their abilities, their future and their environment. They are more likely to imbue their interpretation of events with a more negative flavour. They thus may be more vulnerable to catastrophic reactions when in a highly emotional state. They are thus more vulnerable to impulsive emotional aggression. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        In my opinion, your client manifested symptoms of a depressive disorder that would have made him vulnerable to being emotionally aroused and vulnerable to interpreting his circumstance in negative terms when under duress. On an occasion he felt desperate enough [to] consider killing his son as well as himself (a characteristic feature of homicide/suicides which are commonly associated with depressive disorders). There is no evidence that he formulated a particular plan in this regard prior to the actual time of the alleged offence. On the evening of the offences, the argument about bathing the children and his phone call to his aunt strongly suggests that your client was in a heightened emotional state in the time just prior to the offence. It is probable that, feeling upset, he continued to drink to a point of intoxication which aggravated his emotional state (frustration, hurt and anger), further distorted his interpretation of his circumstances and increased his vulnerability to acting in a disinhibited and impulsive manner. His text messages suggest that at some point he was considering suicide.  
         
         
        In relation to sentencing, my opinion from my previous report remains unchanged. Your client does not meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder or psychopathic personality disorder. The circumstances of these offences were significantly contextually influenced. The risk of recurrence is low.""  
         
         
        
       
      
    75 Subjectively the applicant's circumstances were favourable. He was aged 31 years at the time of sentencing, his prior record was relatively minor, save for the offence which had led to the loss of his security licence, and he had been in virtually continuous employment, albeit in a number of positions, until recent times. He demonstrated significant remorse and contrition. He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, he has never sought to minimise or justify his criminality, and he has favourable prospects of rehabilitation. He is likely to spend much of his sentence on protection, given the disfavour with which the general prison population views crimes involving children as victims.76 While some allowance needs to be made for the early pleas, I do not believe that a 25% reduction would be permissible, since such a reduction would result in a sentencing order that would be inadequate to reflect the very grave objective criminality involved, or the interests of the public: Regina v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at paras 157 and 158. Rather, the allowance should be in the order of 15%.77 While I am of the view that determinant sentences should have been passed, I consider that they should be significant sentences. Even though the offences were closely interconnected, I am satisfied, by reference to the totality principle, that they should each be partially cumulative upon the other. Otherwise, if served concurrently, the effective sentencing order would not reflect the total criminality involved in this terrible episode. I do not regard the decision in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 as standing in the way of such approach. In my view, the term of the sentence in each case should be one of imprisonment for 24 years, with an effective overall accumulation of 10 years, amounting therefore to a total sentence of imprisonment for 34 years, with an effective non-parole period of 27 years.78 There are no special circumstances which would, in my view, justify any reduction in the statutory ratio (as it existed pursuant to the terms of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which applied to offences committed on 2 September 2001) between the effective head sentence and non-parole period, save for a minor adjustment which is necessary, in relation to the final sentence, by reason of the effect of its accumulation upon the other sentences.79 It is essential that the applicant's sentences be lengthy, and there is nothing to indicate that he requires any period of supervision, or assistance, to facilitate his re-integration into the community, beyond the seven years, which the sentences proposed would potentially allow, for release on parole. 80 For these reasons I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal against the sentences; 
       
      2. Set aside the sentences below; 
       
      3. In lieu thereof, order that: 
       
        
        (a) On the first count of murder, relating to Jackson Merritt, the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 24 years, to commence on 2 September 2001, and to expire on 1 September 2025, with a non parole period of 18 years, to commence from 2 September 2001 and to expire on 1 September 2019; 
         
        (b) On the second count of murder relating to Taylah Pringle, the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 24 years, to commence on 2 September 2006, and to expire on 1 September 2030, with a non parole period set of 18 years, to commence on 2 September 2006 and to expire on 1 September 2024; 
         
        (c) On the third count of murder relating to Mikaylah Merritt, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 24 years, to commence on 2 September 2011 and to expire on 1 September 2035, with a non parole period of 17 years, which is similarly to commence on 2 September 2011 and to expire on 1 September 2028.  
         
        
       
      
    81 HIDDEN J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. I also agree with the additional observations of Tobias JA.

       REGINA v NOEL DAVID McNAMARA 
       
       
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 GROVE J: The respondent was tried before Hidden J and a jury upon an indictment charging him with murder. The victim was his mother. The trial commenced on 28 October 2002 and on 12 November 2002 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The only basis upon which the jury were directed that a verdict of guilty of manslaughter was available was if the Crown failed to satisfy them that the respondent, at the time that he killed, possessed a requisite intention giving rise to guilt of murder. In his remarks on sentence the learned judge stated, accurately, that therefore the respondent “stands for sentence on the basis that he killed his mother by an attack which was both unlawful and dangerous, but without an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm or a reckless indifference to human life”. 
     
      
    2 For the crime of manslaughter so committed the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of six years and six months. 
     
      
    3 Before the Court is a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of that sentence.  
     
      
    4 The respondent did not give evidence at his trial or in the sentencing proceedings. There was evidence however that he had claimed to have come home in the early morning and found his mother severely beaten. Some time later he brought her in her declining, and ultimately fatal, condition to the Nepean District Hospital. He also had made claims that both he and his mother had been harassed by members of “bikie” gangs. He had given evidence some years beforehand against such persons in connection with the murder of a friend of his. On the premise that the respondent did not attack his mother, a hypothesis was opened for argument that the culprit was one such bikie. 
     
      
    5 Since conviction the respondent has not acknowledged his guilt and he has reiterated his claims of innocence as well as the history of harassment by bikie gangs. He has pointed to one individual in particular. One occasion of reiteration was to Dr Allnutt a psychiatrist, who saw him two times, the second time for the express purpose of preparing a report for use in the sentencing proceedings.  
     
      
    6 His Honour referred to the critical facts pertinent to the killing in summary form: 
     
      
       
        
        “Some time in the morning of 21 February 2000 the offender attacked his mother, beating her severely. Exactly how her injuries were inflicted is unclear. However, on post mortem examination extensive bruising was observed to the deceased’s head, neck, torso and limbs. More importantly, there were fractures to her sternum and most of her ribs, causing a flail segment which inhibited her breathing. How long she might have remained conscious after the attack is also unclear, but for however long it was she would have been in great pain.” 
        
       
      
    7 In submission to this Court the Crown elaborated upon those facts suggesting, at least by inference, that the summary inadequately describes what was “a vicious assault upon an elderly woman”. She was seventy years of age. On arrival at the hospital the duty clinical nurse at reception noted extensive bruising down the victim’s right arm and further bruising on her left arm, scattered bruising on both legs and small bruises at the throat and neck. The lastmentioned, she described as “fingertip bruising”. Forensic testing at the house detected the presence of blood in an entry way between the laundry and kitchen, on various items in the lounge room and on top of the bed in the main bedroom. 
     
      
    8 Dr Ellis, a pathologist who performed the post mortem examination described extensive external and internal injuries. The Crown written submission presented this detail: 
     
      
       
        
        “There were 34 areas of external injuries, including bruising above the eyes, on the forehead and on the left cheek, abrasions on nose, bruising to the neck, on the skin underneath the scalp and a ‘fairly large bruise’ on the upper chest. There was a line of smaller bruises extending to the left breast. There were bruises on the abdomen and ‘on the back of the trunk there is a very large area of red and blue bruising covering the upper part of the left buttock which extends on to the lower part of the left side of the back’. There were more bruises on the back of the right forearm, on the left upper arm and left forearm, on the back of the right hand and on both legs, right knee and right foot. 
        
       
       
        
        Internal examination revealed that the deceased’s ribs on the left side 1-7 inclusive were broken at the front, ribs 2, 3 and 4 broken at two places, and ribs 9-11 were broken at the back. On the right side, ribs 3-8 were broken at the front and ribs 8-11 to (sic) were broken at the back. There were ‘sharp angles which could actually be felt through the skin at the margins at the front of the chest where the ribs were broken. There were actually broken in a line [on the left] … The sternum, that is the breast bone, was also broken in two places … [This created] a situation where it was very difficult to breathe. …[S]o she is unable to draw the air in, so that’s how death occurs by being in effect [unable] to breathe and the lack of oxygen.’ The Doctor concluded that his (sic) was the principal cause of death, together perhaps with haemorrhaging to the brain in the area of bruising to the head. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Ellis stated that the pattern of the rib fractures on both sides, the double break of the sternum and some fractures at the back of the ribs ‘would indicate to me that considerable force had to be used’. The breaking was consistent with someone stomping or jumping on the deceased as she lay on the floor.” 
        
       
      
    9 Dr Raftos, a specialist in emergency medicine, gave evidence that the chest injuries would have resulted in the loss of consciousness “within minutes”. The injuries were of a type seen in major car accidents and falls. The requisite force would be similar to that applied by a person jumping or stomping on the chest.  
     
      
    10 That the perpetrator of the injuries described which led to death, did not, beyond reasonable doubt, intend at least to cause grievous bodily harm is a proposition which I find astonishing. Nevertheless the jury verdict necessarily conveyed their conclusion that, whatever the intention of the respondent at the time of killing, it was something less than an intention to cause harm of that magnitude. Accordingly, judicial discipline obliges any assessment of sentence to reflect a level of intention compatible with that jury finding. The difficulty of maintaining the correct perspective in this particular case is demonstrated by part of the Crown written submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour did not make any findings about intention, other than those excluded by the verdict. It was however beyond any doubt that the respondent did in fact inflict grievous bodily harm and it was on that basis, independent of any finding regarding his intention that his Honour was required to impose sentence.” 
        
       
      
    11 In a sense the submission is an understatement. The respondent stood for sentence, not because he in fact caused grievous bodily harm, but because in fact he killed. That is not to say that the circumstances in which death was caused are irrelevant but those considerations cannot overwhelm the level of intention as a primary and significant factor in measuring culpability. 
     
      
    12 There was a particular aggravating feature to be taken into account. The respondent was on bail at the time of the offence. There is ample authority that an offender who has abused the conditional liberty of bail by committing further crime should expect salutary penalty. R v Richards 1981 2 NSWLR 464; R v Readman 1990 47 A Crim R 181.  
     
      
    13 The appellant submits that the circumstance that the respondent was on bail at the time he committed the offence does not appear to have been given any material weight in assessment of sentence. In his remarks Hidden J twice referred to bail. First, he mentioned the circumstances for which he was on bail and that the ensuing convictions were later set aside in this Court. Second, although his Honour found that the killing was occasioned during a stressful period of the respondent’s life he added that “the attack was brutal and the offence is a serious one within this category of manslaughter. In addition he has previous convictions for violence and was on bail at the time.” The stress, his Honour had earlier identified as “some kind of threat from bikers” which he found was “a matter of limited significance for the purpose of sentence.” The Crown submission observed that there was no mention in his Honour’s remarks of principles relevant to commission of offences whilst on bail. Whilst that is accurate I am unpersuaded that, given the deliberate reference to bail on two occasions, the issue was overlooked. Nor am I satisfied that there was any misapplication by his Honour. 
     
      
    14 The issue of bail is, to an extent, interwoven with matters on the respondent’s record. Prior convictions are capable of depriving an offender of leniency which he might be able otherwise to seek. There were two significant matters. In 1996 he was placed on a recognizance to be of good behaviour for twelve months upon conviction at Blacktown Local Court of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and malicious damage. He had struck a Ms Gordon, with whom he was in a relationship over an extended period. The property damage was caused by his kicking a wall at his mother’s house. 
     
      
    15 In 1998 at Parramatta Local Court he was found guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Ms Gordon and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment (comprising minimum term nine months and additional term three months). She had been hit around the head and body with an axe handle and was hospitalised for fractures of the ulna and fibula and was also noted to have bruising and lacerations variously located about her head, arms, shoulders, abdomen, and ankles. Detail regarding these offences was tendered in these sentencing proceedings. His Honour made express, if brief, reference to “previous convictions for violence”. No error is demonstrated. 
     
      
    16 Specific challenge was made against two conclusions expressed in the remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    17 His Honour manifestly turned his attention to the issue of protection of the community including members of the respondent’s family. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ The possibility of further acts of violence by the offender, particularly in the context of a relationship with someone to whom he is emotionally attached, is a matter of concern and cannot be ignored. Dr Allnutt did not attempt to assess the likelihood of his re-offending in that way although, in the offender’s favour, he noted that he had enjoyed a supportive family environment as a child and has the capacity to pursue gainful employment. As I have said, it seems that he can still look to one of his siblings for continued support. On balance, with appropriate counselling while in custody and supervision upon his release, I think that there is a reasonable prospect that he will not re-offend. I strongly recommend to the Corrective Service authorities that he be afforded every opportunity to undergo the counselling which Dr Allnutt has advised.” 
        
       
      
    18 The recommendations of Dr Allnutt were simply: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Drug and alcohol counselling. 
        
       
       
        
         2. Anger management counselling.” 
        
       
       
      The absence of any significant problem of substance abuse in the respondent’s history was noted by his Honour.  
       
      
    19 The Crown submitted that the finding that there was reasonable prospect that the respondent would not re-offend is inconsistent with the available evidence which demonstrated a propensity for violence exemplified both by the facts of the instant case and the previous attacks on Ms Gordon. 
     
      
    20 The raising of this issue led to debate about the standard of proof to be applied by a sentencing judge in order to make a finding of future danger to the community which an offender represents. Observations by members of this Court, differently constituted from time to time, are not entirely harmonious. 
     
      
    21 In R v Barton, unreported, NSWCCA 28 July 1995 Kirby ACJ (Dowd J concurring, Allen J in a separate judgment making no reference to onus) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, individual deterrence may take into account, in a general way, the need to protect the community from the propensities demonstrated, or the character manifested, by the particular crime which brings the prisoner before the court. 
        
       
       
        
        It is important that this Court should say firmly that such use of deterrence should never be expanded into orders in the nature of preventive deterrence by the back door. Proof of matters relevant to deterrence are factors which may aggravate the seriousness of the case. The onus of establishing the nature of the deterrence alleged and the level of any propensity lies on the prosecution. It must establish contested matters to the criminal standard of proof. 
        
       
       
        
        When I look at what Badgery-Parker J said in the course of his reasons I consider, with respect to his Honour, that he may have fallen into error. His Honour said this: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The savagery of the killing suggests the need for a substantial sentence not only because of the need from the community point of view to punish such behaviour but because it is strongly suggestive that she is likely after her release to represent a source of danger to others. It is always difficult to predict dangerousness, and particularly to predict what such a person as this may be like when released into the community at the end of a necessarily fairly substantial period of imprisonment. The same lack of maturity and control which led to this killing could all too easily recur should she at some future time find herself under threat. The question of possible future dangerousness was examined at length in the course of the sentencing proceedings, and three psychiatrists gave oral evidence, Dr Barclay and Dr Lucas called on behalf of the prisoner and Dr Shand called on behalf of the Crown.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that it is here that his Honour may have taken an approach which led him to take into account his perspective of future dangerousness by a standard which was less rigorous than that which the law requires.” 
        
       
      
    22 In R v Gieselmann, unreported NSWCCA 13 July 1998 Mason P (Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J agreeing) remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “In considering the significance of the evidence touching on whether the applicant would remain a danger to others in the future by reason of her mental disorder, and for how long in the future, the learned judge reminded himself that the Crown must prove this matter beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    23 However in R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310 Handley JA (Sully and Buddin JJ agreeing) after reference to authorities including Veen v The Queen (No 1) 1979 143 CLR 458; Veen v The Queen (No 2) 1988 164 CLR 465; Chester v The Queen 1988 165 CLR 611; Bugmy v The Queen 1990 169 CLR 428; Mitchell v The Queen 1996 184 CLR 333 and Boughey v The Queen 1986 161 CLR 10 concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus a finding that a prisoner is likely to re-offend does not even require a finding that it is more probable than not that he will do so, let alone a finding that this has been established beyond reasonable doubt”. 
        
       
      
    24 Counsel for the respondent referred to The Queen v Olbrich 1999 199 CLR 270 where in the joint judgment (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ) there was express adoption of what was said by a majority in R v Storey 1998 1 VR 359 that a sentencing judge “may not take facts into account adverse to the interests of the accused unless the facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt”. 
     
      
    25 In regard to Olbrich, I agree with Handley JA’s observation in SLD that the decision should be seen as limited to “facts” and that future probabilities or possibilities are not “facts” in any meaningful sense. 
     
      
    26 I record that the Court has been informed that application by the offender SLD for special leave to appeal to the High Court is presently pending.  
     
      
    27 Counsel for the respondent contended that the test is “whether the offender poses the risk of relevant future conduct” and that the correct approach is for a judge to determine whether he is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such risks exist. With respect to the contender, I do not find that formulation useful. 
     
      
    28 In the span of human affairs risk can always be postulated and of its mere existence there can be no doubt. For example, there is risk that an aircraft may crash, that a ship may sink, that motorcars may collide, that a person of previously unblemished character may commit a crime, that a convict may offend again. The elimination of risk is something which is viewable only from hindsight. The aircraft did not crash etc. The convict, to the end of his life, did not re-offend. What is of concern to a sentencing judge is, in my opinion, not the existence of risk – that I would see as a given - but a degree of risk. That does not require the certitude of proof beyond reasonable doubt nor the exercise of balance to determine what is more probable than not. 
     
      
    29 On that approach, references to proof beyond reasonable doubt or proof on the balance of probabilities become otiose. This is demonstrable by reference to the latter. That a mere “tilt” on the balance of probabilities would lead to one offender having the likelihood of future offence taken into account (adversely) but another, falling just short of a “tilt,” being found unlikely to offend does not reflect an even handed application of justice. 
     
      
    30 It follows that I prefer the views expressed by Handley JA in SLD to the contrary expressions in Barton and Gieselmann. This appeal does not turn on that preference. 
     
      
    31 The Crown argued that, irrespective of any view on the onus applicable to proof of potential risk of future offence, the sentencing judge had fallen into error in making an “opposite” finding of sound prospects of not re-offending. The extract above recited from the remarks on sentence gives context to his Honour’s finding. It was a conditional finding upon a premise that appropriate counselling whilst in custody and supervision on release would be given. This was derivable from Dr Allnutt’s opinion that to address any risk which the respondent may pose in the future, he have the counselling earlier described. The finding was open on the evidence to the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    32 The other matter of specific focus was an alleged failure to place the offence in context. His Honour found that “the attack has all the hallmarks of being perpetrated spontaneously in a rage”. That finding is not challenged but it is contended that it is difficult to explain why after recovery of his composure, the respondent did not immediately seek medical attention for his mother. There was evidence that a car journey from the house to the hospital would take about five minutes. The respondent had a vehicle and, eventually, delivered his mother to hospital by using it. It was put that the respondent appears to have spent valuable time changing the victim’s clothing and cleaning up the scene. These are matters of argument and I do not consider that there is a demonstration of error in his Honour’s assessment. 
     
      
    33 In the absence of identified error there remains an issue as to whether the sentence is such that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons: cf Wong v The Queen 2001 207 CLR 584. 
     
      
    34 As recognized in written submissions by the Crown, it has been said that the range of conduct which can lead to conviction for manslaughter is such that little assistance can be derived from sentences in other cases: R v Hill 1980 3 A Crim R 297. However, insofar as there is a compilation of statistics by the Judicial Commission it can be observed that the sentence here imposed does not lie outside any established pattern of sentencing for the particular crime. The observation includes the circumstances that in this case there was neither a plea of guilty nor an acknowledgement of guilt after conviction which are circumstances which generally provide a foundation for amelioration of sentence. Such was not available to the respondent for those reasons. 
     
      
    35 The Crown however submits that the matter should “properly have been regarded as falling within the worst case category”. This submission is founded upon three express contentions: His Honour’s failure to have proper regard to the circumstances of the case, the aggravating circumstance of commission whilst on bail and the issue of future dangerousness. For the reasons above stated, I do not consider that those contentions have been established. 
     
      
    36 Nevertheless having regard to the extreme violence actually administered, and although, I again emphasize, bound by the jury verdict to accept that grievous bodily harm was not intended, I would, myself, have imposed a sentence greater than that which his Honour did. 
     
      
    37 The power of this Court to intervene is not enlivened by such a difference of opinion. The Court is established by statute and is a court of error not a court of review. It must be borne in mind that every sentence results from an exercise of judicial discretion. There is no such thing as a “correct” sentence: Ryan v The Queen 2001 206 CLR 267. A consequence is that Crown appeals should be rare: Everett v The Queen 1994 181 CLR 295. Recent recapitulation of this was made by Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion there is no warrant for this Court to interfere with the sentencing discretion by her Honour. The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified in the manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred.” 
        
       
      
    38 I would dismiss the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    39 SULLY J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    40 BELL J: I agree with Grove J.

     Judgment 
      
      
     
       
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act brought in relation to a trial that is currently proceeding before Hulme J and a jury in the city of Griffith. An affidavit of Adelle Hudson shows that the Crown case closed on the 8th of this month and that evidence called by the applicant is very close to finished. It is common ground that it is anticipated that his Honour will commence summing-up to the jury on Monday next. The trial has been proceeding for approximately a month. 
     
      
    2 This application seeks, in effect, that this Court grant leave and intervene in respect of two rulings made by his Honour in each of which he refused to discharge the jury. A secondary order, which was forecast, was that the applicant wished the venue of the trial to be moved from Griffith to Sydney. 
     
      
    3 The first application was made to his Honour when the trial had been proceeding for about five or six days, two of which had been occupied in a voir dire hearing. The basis of that application, as appears from his Honour’s published ruling, was that he came to the conclusion that certain material published in a newspaper called the Border Mail did not give rise to circumstances that would render the trial unfair.  
     
      
    4 The Border Mail is a newspaper published in Albury, a city some 300 kilometres from Griffith, and it appears from the material before us that counsel appearing for the applicant at trial saw copies of that newspaper in a newsagency in Griffith. Subsequent enquiries revealed, and there was some assent to the results, that the sales of that newspaper in the three relevant Griffith newsagencies totalled on Saturdays about forty copies and on other days of the week about twenty and sometimes less than twenty. Nevertheless, it is pointed out that in common with newspapers around the world, the Border Mail is available to those who have access to the Internet. 
     
      
    5 There were multiple publications in the Border Mail relating to the applicant’s forensic situation. This is hardly surprising as what was involved was a matter of obvious public interest, particularly in the local area. It appears that the applicant has been charged with two separate murders and the material before us shows that there is no association or link between them.  
     
      
    6 The publications on some twenty-five occasions which have been drawn to our attention in the Border Mail were substantially of three types. The first were reportings of committal proceedings in respect of the murders; the second was publication in relation to the police investigation and the third were publications relating to the duality of charges against the applicant.  
     
      
    7 The situation is that prior to the present trial the applicant has been presented in respect of the charge of the second murder and pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which has been accepted by the Crown in discharge of the relevant indictment. He has not yet been sentenced in respect of that matter.  
     
      
    8 It might be observed that whilst, as counsel for the applicant has said today, much of that material may be viewed as prejudicial to the applicant, that is inevitably the case when there is powerful incriminating evidence given at committal proceedings. Indeed, it is often remarked that merely to observe that prosecution evidence is prejudicial is to state the obvious. A person is charged because law enforcement authorities wish to make serious allegations against that person. 
     
      
    9 His Honour gave reasons for exercising his discretion against ordering the discharge of the jury. There are well-known restraints upon this Court intervening to overturn such an exercise of discretion and now is not an occasion for those to be once again recited. 
     
      
    10 The matter was raised again, however, on the first of this month when it came to attention that the Area News, a newspaper published in Griffith itself, had published a photograph of the applicant arriving at court with a caption describing him as an “accused murderer”. The photograph showed the applicant, handcuffed, alighting from a vehicle and around him, near what appears to be the entrance to Griffith Court House, are some six officers, possibly Corrective Services officers or a mixture of Corrective Services officers and police, and one of them has on a lead an Alsatian dog. The text underneath the photograph includes reference to “an order made by his Honour to suppress the name of a witness.” This was a matter referred to in the application but not raised again before this Court. For my part, I cannot see that anything could turn upon that part of the publication. 
     
      
    11 The description of the applicant as an “accused murderer” is, of course, ambiguous. In one sense it must be obvious to the jury that the reason that he is there is that he is accused of murder. The other side of the coin is that it is capable of being interpreted as suggesting that he is already a person of that description. For my part, I would think that any ambiguity is something that in his discretion a trial judge could easily rectify by appropriate direction.  
     
      
    12 The significant thrust of the applicant’s argument before this Court has been focused upon the appearance of the applicant surrounded, as it were, by custodial officers and with a dog there present. It is arguable that that may be viewed as a suggestion that the applicant himself is a dangerous person or, as was suggested in an exchange with counsel, an alternative available interpretation might be that he was in need of protection himself. Be that as it may, it seems to me that this was a matter which, if desired, could readily be cured by an appropriate direction. 
     
      
    13 The matter before this Court, of course, is whether or not we should intervene in relation to his Honour’s exercise of discretion. In my view there is no cause shown for us so to do. I acknowledge that the submission on behalf of the applicant was based upon an accumulation of these two matters rather than viewing them separately, but on that basis I come to no different conclusion. 
     
      
    14 Reference was made to the well-known remarks of Mason CJ and Toohey J in The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at p 604. This has particular reference to the publication in the Border Mail of the circumstance of the conviction of the applicant for manslaughter consequent on his plea of guilty. It is true, as their Honours there pointed out, that reception of inadmissible evidence of a prior conviction is something zealously guarded against by the law. That is, of course, not this case. It is not a question of such evidence being put before the jury but a speculation or risk that some juror may have acquired this information from a newspaper published some 300 kilometres from the area from which the jury was drawn but, to an extent, available in that area. 
     
      
    15 As the judgment goes on to point out, it is for the trial judge to decide whether it is necessary to discharge the jury in the interests of securing a fair trial. In this case his Honour came to the conclusion that it was not.  
     
      
    16 I am unpersuaded his Honour was wrong. Their Honours go on to point out, of course, that if the trial proceeds and results in a conviction, this Court can review the matter in the light of what has in fact occurred. 
     
      
    17 Given all those circumstances and the circumstance that I referred to in the beginning, namely, that this trial is almost completed, I regard it as entirely inappropriate for this Court at this stage to intervene. I would refuse leave. 
     
      
    18 SIMPSON J: I agree with the order proposed but I wish to state my reasons separately. I accept that the publication of the fact the applicant was charged with two separate murders is a matter that in a country town would be likely to remain in the minds of potential jurors, or others who might have read the material and then seen fit to communicate it to a juror. Had the realisation of the publication in Griffith come to light at an earlier stage, a change of venue if sought would have been appropriate.  
     
      
    19 The additional material to which the presiding judge has referred that was published was also capable of adding to the prejudice. It is not without significance that this material was available on the Internet, one of the features of which is ready retrieval of material that might previously have sunk into oblivion; that is, individuals who recalled having read something about these charges could have ready access and revisit the publications.  
     
      
    20 The photograph in the Griffith newspaper during the course of the trial should not have been published. It was capable of identifying the applicant as a person who appeared to be violent and/or a potential escapee.  
     
      
    21 The judgment we have to make is a discretionary one and we are called upon to make it in the closing stages of the current trial. That would be a less powerful consideration but for one thing, that is, the applicant’s previous plea of guilty to a charge of manslaughter. Although there was no direct evidence before us we were told that he has not yet been sentenced. But counsel conceded that the overwhelming likelihood is that he will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for that offence.  
     
      
    22 The consequence is this: let it be assumed the publicity rendered the present trial unfair and let it further be assumed that the applicant is convicted in the present trial. In the ordinary course that would mean that the applicant would spend time in custody pending an appeal referable to the present charge, that is time that he should not spend in custody. Should he ultimately be acquitted, that would be a great injustice.  
     
      
    23 In those circumstances it is unattractive to say simply that he has his remedy on appeal, but that is not this case. It may be accepted that the applicant will remain in custody on the manslaughter charge. Even if it emerges that the present trial is unfair, it will not have resulted in any additional time spent in custody by him. The prejudice to him is thus diminished almost out of existence. 
     
      
    24 For those reasons, I agree that leave should be refused.25 SPERLING J: I also would refuse leave. 
     
      
    26 This Court exercises its discretion as to whether to grant leave to appeal having regard to the stage reached in the trial as of today, 12 March. By contrast, his Honour exercised his discretion having regard to the stages reached in the trial, respectively on 25 February and 1 March. 
     
      
    27 It is a further relevant and unusual circumstance that if leave were granted in the present matter and the appeal allowed, the applicant would remain in custody pending a new trial because of another matter. 
     
      
    28 In my view, there would need to be an overwhelming case of irremediable prejudice to warrant this Court terminating the trial in the foregoing circumstances. 
     
      
    29 Having regard to those considerations, I would refuse leave. 
     
      
    30 GROVE J: The order of the Court, therefore, is leave to appeal refused.

      Introduction 
       
      
    2 This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth (“DPP”) against an order for a pecuniary penalty for $1,148,143.20 made in the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court on 23 August 2002. The pecuniary penalty order appealed against was expressed to be made pursuant to s 26 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth). The amount of $1,148,143.20 was stated in order to be: 
     
      
       
        
        “the amount of the benefit derived by the Respondent (“ 
        William Benedict O’Driscoll 
        ”) from the commission of the offences under s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 and s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 set out in the Schedule” (italics added).  
        
       
      
     The appeal was lodged on 4 September 2003. 
     
      
    3 The schedule to the order set out two offences under the Crimes Act, 1914 (Cth) (Crimes Act 1914) of defrauding the Commonwealth that were committed between 15 July 1995 and 11 August 1998 and 16 offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (Financial Transaction Reports Act) committed between 29 February 1996 and 17 April 1997. 
     
      
    4 The respondent had been charged with offences under both Acts. On 8 May 2002 a jury found him guilty of two offences under s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 and 16 offences under s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act. He was sentenced to imprisonment, for an aggregate term of 7 ½ years with a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 26 November 2001. 
     
      
    5 In the course of sentencing him the District Court Judge dealt with the schemes in which the Respondent had engaged. He calculated that the Respondent had obtained a benefit of “more than $900,000.00” from one scheme and “$236,036.00” from the other. Both of these amounts were arrived at by calculations based on a percentage of various amounts deposited into certain bank accounts as part of the schemes. In imposing the sentences for the offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Those offences falls within the same factual parameters as the two s 29D offences …” 
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
        “The fact that the transactions were carried out in the way they were, as cash transactions for amounts less than $10,000.00, considerably diminished the likelihood of detection. The offences were therefore an integral part of the fraud and I have taken that fact into account as part of the commission of the fraud itself.” 
        
       
      
    6 On 23 August 2002 the District Court Judge (the Judge) made the order referred to in paragraph 1 above, it being in the form requested by the DPP. 
     
      
    7 The Respondent appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against his convictions and on 26 June 2003 his convictions in respect of the offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act were quashed. However, his appeal with respect to the convictions under s 29 D of the Crimes Act 1914 was dismissed.  
     
      
      Statutory Provisions and Analysis 
       
      
    8 The present appeal by the DPP is expressly based on s 100 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) (“the 1987 Act”). That Act provided, inter alia, for various types of orders against persons in relation to indictable offences. These included: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) a restraining order against property of a person who has been convicted of, or has been, or is about to be, charged with an indictable offence (s 43(2)); 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) a forfeiture order against property that is tainted i.e. used in or in connection with the commission of an indictable offence or the proceeds of such an offence (s 19(1), s 4); 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) automatic forfeiture of property where a person is convicted of a serious offence and certain other conditions are fulfilled, one of which is that a restraining order had been made in respect of certain property before the commencement of the  
        Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth)  
        (s 30(1)); 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) a pecuniary penalty order against a person convicted of an indictable offence in respect of the benefits derived by such person from the commission of such an offence (s 14(1)(b). 
        
       
      
    9 Each of the categories of orders referred to in the preceding paragraph could be brought to an end under the provisions of the 1987 Act: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (i) A restraining order that was made in reliance on the proposed charging of a person with an indictable offence ceased to have force at the end of 48 hours if the person was not charged with such offence or a related indictable offence (s 57(1)). If the restraining order was made in relation to the charging of a person with an indictable offence the order ceased to be in force when the charge was withdrawn or the person was acquitted. Such discharge occurred when the acquittal occurred (s 57(2)(d)(ii)), unless the acquittal occurred after the commencement of the  
          Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) 
          . In such a case the order ceased to be in force at the end of the period of 28 days after the day of the acquittal.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) In relation to a forfeiture order made under the 1987 Act, where the forfeiture order was made in reliance on a person’s conviction of an indictable offence and the conviction was subsequently quashed, the quashing of the conviction discharged the order (s 22(1)). However where the conviction was quashed after the commencement of the  
          Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) 
          , 
            
          s 22 of the 1987 Act has no application. The mechanism for dealing with such a situation is to be found in Part 2-2, Division 6 of the  
          Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) 
          . Thus the provisions of the 1987 Act in relation to the discharge of forfeiture orders commit those which are the subject of the relevant event i.e. quashing of a conviction, to a regime that is different where the event occurs after the coming in to force the  
          Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) 
          .  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) A forfeiture order made pursuant to s 30 of the 1987 Act in reliance on a conviction for a serious offence may in effect be reversed where the conviction is subsequently quashed (s 32(1) and (3)). However specific provision is made in ss 32(1A) that the procedure provided for in s 32 does not apply if the conviction was quashed after the commencement of the  
          Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) 
          .  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iv) A pecuniary penalty order made pursuant to s 26 of the 1987 Act  
          
         
        
       
      
     10 Under the 1987 Act a pecuniary penalty order is defined to mean “an order under section 26(1)” of the 1987 Act. By such Act the DPP was empowered to seek such an order “where a person is convicted of an indictable offence” (s 14). However, the power of the DPP to seek such an order is denied as from the commencement of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), unless some or all of the property which could be used to satisfy the order is property in respect of which a restraining order is in force (s 14(2)). Since the power of the court to make a pecuniary penalty order is predicated on an application being made by the DPP for such an order, the denial to the DPP of power to make such an application to the court relevantly deprives the court of jurisdiction to make pecuniary penalty orders under the 1987 Act as from the commencement of the Proceeds of Crimes Act 2002 (Cth). Furthermore, the DPP is not empowered to make an application for a pecuniary penalty order under s 14(1) against a person in respect of benefits derived from such person from the commission of an offence if an application has previously been made under s 14(1) (s 14(4)(a)(i)) and the application has been finally determined on the merits (s 14(4)(b)). The court may however grant leave to make such an application, but that power is negated in the present case by s 14(5) (a) and (b). 
     
      
    11 Like those provisions of the 1987 Act that relate to restraining orders, forfeiture orders and automatic forfeitures, the provisions of s 14 support the conclusion that after the commencement of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) applications relating to the making of pecuniary penalty orders do not fall within the ambit of the 1987 Act, except in quite limited circumstances that do not include those of the present case. 
     
      
    12 Section 100 provides for appeals in respect of, inter alia, pecuniary penalty orders. On appeal the court is empowered by s 100(4) to confirm, discharge or vary any pecuniary penalty order the subject of the appeal. It was conceded on behalf of the DPP there is no mechanism in the 1987 Act for the DPP to go back to the District Court that made the pecuniary penalty order following the quashing of some of the convictions on which the order was based.  
     
      
    13 Rights of appeal are conferred on a person against whom a pecuniary penalty order is made and on the DPP (s 100(1) and (5)). A person against whom a pecuniary penalty order has been made: 
     
      
       
        
        “may appeal against that order in the same manner as if it were, or were part of, a sentence imposed on the person in respect of the offence in reliance on which the order was made” (s 100(2)) 
        
       
      
    The DPP may appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “against … a pecuniary penalty order … in the same manner as if the order were, or were part of, a sentence imposed in respect of the offence in reliance on which the order was made.” (s 100(5)) 
        
       
       
      Thus the right of appeal conferred on the DPP by the 1987 Act is in the same terms as that conferred on a person against whom a pecuniary penalty order is made.  
       
      
    14 Although no time limit is expressed in the 1987 Act within which the right of appeal against a pecuniary penalty order may be exercised, the section proceeds on the basis that the procedural rules of the court to which the appeal is made will apply. This is inherent in those provisions of s 100 that prescribe that the right of appeal is to be exercised “in the same manner as if” the pecuniary penalty order were a sentence imposed on the person the subject of the order. As a consequence s 100 is not to be construed as conferring a right of appeal without limitation as to the time within which such right may be exercised.  
     
      
    15 In New South Wales an appeal by a convicted person against his or her conviction lies to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Such appeals are regulated by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides for the exercise of the right of appeal “within 28 days after the conviction or sentence” (s 10(1)(a)), although the court may extend the time within which a notice of appeal may be given (s 10(1)(b)). 
     
      
    16 Under the 1987 Act a pecuniary penalty order is defined to mean an order made under s 26 of the Act (see definition in s 4). The legislative scheme for the making of pecuniary penalty orders depended on “the commission of an offence” (s 26), but the order was able to be enforced as if it were an order made in civil proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth and the amount included in the order was taken to be a judgment debt (s 26(9)). The assessment of the value of the benefits derived from the commission of an offence was required to be made in accordance with s 27.  
     
      
    17 The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (No 85, 2002; the 2002 Act) was assented to on 11 October 2002 and came into force on 1 January 2003 (s 2). The objects of the 2002 Act are set out in s 5. They are broader and more expansively expressed then those of the 1987 Act (s 3). The 2003 Act also provides for bases for the making of restraining, forfeiture and pecuniary penalty orders that are different from and wider than those provided for in the 1987 Act. In so far as pecuniary penalty orders are concerned the provisions of the 2002 Act (Part 2-4, ss 116 to 150) are much more draconian than those in the 1987 Act. For example, conviction of an indictable offence is no longer necessary.  
     
      
    18 Under s 116, it is no longer necessary that the person the subject of pecuniary penalty order be convicted of an indictable offence and for such person to have derived benefits from the commission of an indictable offence before such an order is made. This is in marked distinction to the requirements of s 26(1) of the 1987 Act. However, an pecuniary penalty order may still be made on the basis of a conviction for an indictable offence and deriving benefits from the commission of such offence (s 116(1)(b)(i). Furthermore, the fact that a person has been acquitted of the offence that was the basis for the making of the pecuniary penalty order does not affect the Court’s power to make such an order in relation to that very offence (s 120). Under the 2002 Act, it is a sufficient basis for the making of a pecuniary penalty order if the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person has committed a serious offence (s 116(1)(b)(ii)) and, provided that the offence is not a terrorism offence, that it was committed within 6 years preceding the making of the application (s 116(2)).  
     
      
    19 Under the 2002 Act a pecuniary penalty order is defined to mean “an order made under s 116 that is in force” (s 338). The Act also provides for the discharge of a pecuniary penalty order, where such an order has been made in relation to a conviction for a serious offence. Section 146 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A pecuniary penalty order made in relation to a person’s conviction of a serious offence is discharged if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person’s conviction of the offence is subsequently quashed (whether or not the order relates to the person’s conviction of other offences that have not been quashed); and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the DPP does not, within 14 days after the conviction is quashed apply to the court that made the order for the order to be confirmed. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) However, unless and until a court decides otherwise on such an application, the quashing of the conviction does not effect the pecuniary penalty order: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) for 14 days after the conviction is quashed; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the DPP makes such an application; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) A pecuniary penalty order made in relation to a person’s conviction of an offence that is not a serious offence is discharged if the person’s conviction for the offence is subsequently quashed.” 
        
       
      
    20 The pecuniary penalty order presently under consideration was not made under s 116 of the 2002 Act. It was made under s 26 of the 1987 Act. However, the quashing of a number of the convictions on which the pecuniary penalty order was based occurred after the commencement of the 2002 Act. Thus, the relevant events in relation to the pecuniary penalty order straddle the two Acts. The transition between the two Acts is dealt with by the Proceeds of Crime (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2002 (Cth) (Transitional Provisions Act). In the Transitional Provisions Act there are provisions that deal with pecuniary penalty orders made under the 1987 Act where the conviction on which such orders were based has been quashed. Section 23 provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “If: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) before or after the commencement of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, an order was made under section 26 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 in relation to a person’s conviction of an offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) after the commencement of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the conviction is subsequently quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        Division 5 of Part 2-4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 applies in relation to the order in the same way that it would apply if the order had been made under Division 1 of that Part.” 
        
       
      
    21 The 2002 Act was assented to on 11 October 2002 and relevantly came into effect on 1 January 2003. The pecuniary penalty order under consideration in the present case was made before the commencement of the 2002 Act and the conviction on which it was based was quashed after its commencement. It therefore falls within s 23 of the Transitional Provisions Act. The offences for which the Respondent was convicted were serious offences within the meaning of the 2002 Act (s 338) in that a loss to the Commonwealth of more than $10,000.00 was caused. The combined effect of these provisions is that the pecuniary penalty order under consideration must be dealt with in accordance with Division 5 of Part 2-4 of the 2002 Act, in which s 146 is included.  
     
      
    22 The scheme of s 146 is that: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) it contemplates that a pecuniary penalty order may relate to a conviction for more than one offence. This is clear from the parenthetical clause in s 146(1)(a); 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (ii) when a pecuniary penalty order is based on convictions in relation to multiple offences and some, but not all, of such convictions are later quashed. 
        
       
      
      
     
      
      the pecuniary penalty order is nonetheless discharged unless the DPP within 14 days after the quashing of any such convictions makes an application to the Court that made the order for the order to be confirmed.  
       
      
    23 Since 16 of the convictions on which the pecuniary penalty order was based were quashed on 26 June 2003 and no application was made by the DPP within 14 days after such date for the order to be confirmed, the pecuniary penalty order has been discharged and there is now no avenue for the DPP to seek to set it aside or vary it under the 2002 Act. 
     
      
    24 Faced with this problem, the DPP submitted that the relevant provisions of the 1987 Act were not repealed by the 2002 Act or the Transitional Provisions Act and that s 100 continued to be applicable to all pecuniary penalty orders made under the 1987 Act. This submission flies in the face of the terms of s 23 of the Transitional Provisions Act. Furthermore, the amendments effected to the 1987 Act by Part 1 of Schedule 7 of the Transitional Provisions Act, some of which have already been referred to above, make it clear that after the commencement of the 2002 Act it is to that Act that regard should be had in dealing with matters, such as in the present case, that straddle the 1987 and the 2002 Acts. As a consequence the arguments by the DPP concerning the applicability of s 100 of the 1987 Act to the pecuniary penalty order under appeal should be rejected. The powers conferred by s 100 have no application to such pecuniary penalty order in the circumstances of the present case. 
     
      
    25 The DPP also argued that the pecuniary penalty order of 23 August 2002 was affected by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 26 June 2003 only in so far as the order related to the Financial Transactions Reports Act. However, the order that was made under s 26 of the 1987 Act is expressed to be in respect of the offences under both the Financial Transactions Reports Act and the Crimes Act 1914. It is a single order for one amount. It is indivisible. Whilst the express inclusion in it of the offences under both Acts may have been brought about by the way in which the Judge related the two sets of offences, ie, that detection of the Crimes Act 1914 offences was rendered more difficulty by the intertwining of the facts and circumstances of both sets of offences, the fact remains that the order was made on the basis of both sets of offences. Since 16 of the 18 offences on which it was based have been quashed, the pecuniary penalty order has been discharged by virtue of s 146 of the 2002 Act.  
     
      
    26 Even if the provisions of s 100 of the 1987 Act were still to be regarded as applying to the pecuniary penalty order, (which they do not), there would still be no right in the DPP at this time to have the order varied. Any power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to vary the order is conditioned by the time limits provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The time for appeal has long since expired. No application has been made by the DPP for an extension of the time within which to appeal. So, even if the matter were to be considered pursuant to the provisions of the 1987 Act, the present appeal would fail. 
     
      
    27 The DPP has also contended that the pecuniary penalty order included unnecessary words, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “and section 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
      and that they can, and should, be treated as surplusage and disregarded. Those words however, are part of the order and are consistent with the way in which the Judge dealt with the interrelation and intertwining of the factual circumstances giving rise to offences under both Acts. It is not appropriate to ignore them as surplusage.  
       
      
    28 It was further contended that the pecuniary penalty order did not distinguish or identify the quantum of the benefit derived by the Respondent from the offences under the Crimes Act 1914 on the one hand and the Financial Transactions Reports Act on the other. This was said to constitute an error in the making of the pecuniary penalty order in the form in which it was made and that, on a proper construction of s 26 and s 27 of the 1987 Act, the Judge was required to assess the benefit to the offender derived from the commission of each offence or set of offences. I do not think that this is correct. In s 26 of the 1987 Act the singular (“an offence”) includes the plural (“offences”) (Interpretation Act 1987 s 8(b)). In addition s 14(6) provides that an application under the section may be made in respect of one or more indictable offences. It was therefore competent for the Judge to assess the benefits derived by the Respondent from the offences for which he had been convicted and to include a single amount in respect of such offences in the one order.  
     
      
    29 Section 27(2) reinforces such a view. It provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purposes of an application for  
        a 
         pecuniary penalty order against a person (in this subsection called ‘the defendant’), the value of the benefits derived by the defendant from the commission of an offence  
        or offences 
         shall be assessed by the court …” (bold added). 
        
       
       
      The form of this subsection contemplates the making of a single (“a”) pecuniary penalty order in which the value of the benefits derived by the defendant may be from the commission of a single offence or from the commission of a number of offences (“offence or offences”). 
       
      
    30 Section 27(5) supports a like conclusion. It refers to the making of an application” for a pecuniary penalty order against a person in respect of 2 or more ordinary indictable offences…” This subsection clearly contemplates the inclusion of the value of the benefits derived from multiple offences in the one order. Section 27(6) is to a like effect in respect of serious offences.  
     
      
    31 Thus the inclusion within the pecuniary penalty order of a single figure as the value of the benefit derived by the Respondent from the commission of multiple offences is contemplated by the 1987 Act. It does not involve error and does not have the effect of invalidating the order. 
     
      
    32 Even if, contrary to the view expressed above, it were to be regarded as an error to include one amount in a pecuniary penalty order based on multiple offences, any such error was committed on 23 August 2002 and that is well outside the time limit for appeal provided for by s 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In this context, it should not be lost sight of that the pecuniary penalty order made by the Judge was in the precise form that was sought by the DPP. The Judge did no more than that which the DPP asked him to do. In these circumstances the DPP can hardly be said to be aggrieved by the actual form, or the making, of the order.  
     
      
    33 None of the foregoing matters affect the validity of the pecuniary penalty order. It was an order that was valid when made. It was as a consequence of subsequent events that it was discharged. Had the DPP made application for confirmation of the order pursuant to s 146 of the 2002 Act within the time limited by that section, the pecuniary penalty order made in the District Court on 23 August 2002 would not have been discharged until the application had been disposed of pursuant to ss 149 and 150. 34 Finally it was submitted on behalf of the DPP that the order made on 23 August 2002 was in effect two pecuniary penalty orders rolled into one and that whilst one of those was struck down as a result of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 26 June 2003, the other remains extant. Such submission does not accord with the form of the order made in the District Court as was requested by the DPP. A single order was made for a single amount that was stated to be the proceeds derived by the Respondent from the various offences referred to in the order. To treat it otherwise would be a departure from reality and not in accordance with law. This submission is without foundation and fails.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    35 For the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that the appeal by the DPP should be dismissed and I so propose.

      FACTS 
       
        
       
      The respondent pleaded guilty before Dodd DCJ to four offences of break, enter and steal, including an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. The offences were laid pursuant to s.112(1), s.113(1) and s.113(2) of the  
      Crimes Act (NSW) 1900 
      . The first and last sections carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment whilst the second carries a penalty of 10 years imprisonment. In addition, there were six matters on a Form 1 to be taken into account. Dodd DCJ granted an adjournment for 12 months pursuant to s.11 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW) 1999 
       to enable the respondent to participate in a drug rehabilitation programme. 
       
       
      The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred in failing to inform the respondent that it was likely he would receive a custodial sentence notwithstanding that the proceedings were to be adjourned for 12 months to enable him to demonstrate that rehabilitation had taken place.  
       
       
      HELD per Beazley JA (O’Keefe and Bell JJ agreeing): 
       
       
      (i) The application for an order under s.11 in this case was made on the premise that an eventual custodial sentence was likely.  
       
       
      (ii) The adjournment was sought to facilitate the respondent’s rehabilitation process and to assist the determination of an appropriate non-parole period.  
       
       
      (iii) The trial judge granted the adjournment for those reasons. 
       
       
      (iv) The Crown’s challenge to the basis upon which the sentencing judge dealt with the respondent in granting the adjournment was due to a misunderstanding of comments made by Dodd DCJ to the respondent.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: This is a Crown appeal against sentence. The appeal raises the question of the appropriateness of a bond under s.11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW) 1999, when the commission of the offences in this case called for the imposition of a period of imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 On 15 October 2003, the respondent pleaded guilty before his Honour Judge Dodd at Sydney District Court to four break, enter and steal offences, including an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal. Those offences were committed over a period commencing on 17 December 2002, when he was arrested and granted bail, and ending on 26 May 2003 when he was again arrested. The offences charged were laid under s.112(1), s.113(1) and s.113(2) of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900. The offences under s.112(1) and 113(2) carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The offence under s.113(1) carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. At the time of his arrest on 26 May 2003, the respondent was on bail in respect of the first count on the indictment, being the offence committed on 17 December 2002.  
     
      
    3 In addition to the four counts to which he pleaded guilty, there were six matters on a Form 1, being offences committed between 12 December 2002 and 26 May 2003, that the respondent requested the Court to take into account. The first offence on the Form 1 was an offence under s. 154(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, being the offence of take and drive a conveyance without consent, carrying a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The second offence was the offence of break, enter and steal: s. 112(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The other four offences were committed on 26 May 2003 being two offences of goods in custody (s.527C(1)(c) of the Crimes Act); possessing prohibited drugs (s.10(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985); possessing housebreaking implements (s.114(1)(b) of the Crimes Act). The last of these offences carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The respondent pleaded guilty to the first charge on the indictment before a local court magistrate on 5 June 2003. He pleaded guilty to the remaining three counts on 2 September 2003, also before a local court magistrate. He adhered to those pleas when the matter came before his Honour, Judge Dodd, in the District Court on 16 October 2003.  
     
      
       
      The offences 
       
      
    5 First count on the indictment: aggravated break and enter with intent to steal: s.113(2) of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
       
      On 17 December 2002 the respondent was seen with another man outside a property in Redfern. The two men were observed to remove a security grill from a window to a unit in the property and to climb through the window. The observer contacted the police who took up positions outside the unit. Both men gave themselves up shortly afterwards. An inspection of the premises revealed that it had been ransacked and a blue backpack, which the two men had been observed to have with them when they entered, was found on the bathroom floor, containing a number of tools. The matter of aggravation relied upon by the Crown in respect of this offence was the fact that the respondent was in company at the time he committed the offence.  
       
      
    6 The respondent was charged with this offence later that day and was granted bail with conditions that he report daily to the police officer in charge of Kingsgrove Police Station between 8.00 a.m. and 10.00 p.m. 
     
      
    7 Second count on the indictment: break enter and steal; s.112(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      Sometime between the hours of 6.00 p.m. on Tuesday 28 January 2003 and 4.30 a.m. on 29 January 2003, the respondent entered premises at Silverwater and stole a computer and two telephone fax machines. He had gained entry to the premises by opening one of the first floor glass windows. He also smashed a window on this floor. Blood found on glass fragments as well as on other items inside the premises returned a DNA result which matched that of the respondent. The value of the property stolen on this occasion was approximately $1,300.00.  
       
      
    8 Third count on the indictment: break, enter and steal: s.112(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      Between 24 May 2003 and 26 May 2003 the respondent broke into office premises at Liverpool and stole a considerable quantity of office equipment including electrical equipment, video cassette recorders and printers. The total value of the property stolen was in excess of $15,000.00.  
       
      
    9 Fourth count on the indictment: break and enter with intent to steal: s.113(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      In the early hours of Monday 26 May 2003, the respondent jemmied open the front sliding door of business premises at Kingsgrove. He had in his possession at the time a blue/grey backpack containing a number of house breaking implements including a long handled screwdriver, a crowbar, a cordless electric screwdriver and a torch. A patrolling police vehicle prompted the respondent to cease his efforts to gain entry into the premises. However, he was noticed walking away from the premises by police in another police vehicle. He was apprehended a short distance away. The respondent made a full admission in respect of this offence.  
       
       
      Respondent’s personal circumstances 
       
      
    10 The respondent was born on 7 April 1970 and was 32-33 years of age at the time of the commission of these offences. He has been in a de facto relationship for about 8 years and has two children of that relationship aged 6 and 7 years. The family lives in rented accommodation in Bexley. He has a 13 year old daughter from a previous relationship with whom he maintains contact. The respondent has a serious drug problem and an extensive criminal record. His first recorded offence was in 1984 when he was convicted of possessing a prohibited drug (LSD). His record thereafter involves numerous stealing offences and other offences of dishonesty, driving offences and drug offences. He has served a number of custodial sentences of varying lengths, the first imposed in early 1991. He has had sentences of periodic detention and community service.  
     
      
    11 The longest term of imprisonment was imposed on 5 June 2001 at Sydney District Court. On that occasion he was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 2 years with a non-parole period of 18 months. That sentence was in respect of the offence of “aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence in company”. The respondent was convicted of three other offences on that occasion in respect of which concurrent sentences were imposed.  
     
      
    12 The last custodial sentence prior to the commission of the first of the offences the subject of the current appeal was imposed on 11 July 2001 at the Sutherland Local Court, when the respondent was imprisoned for a period of 6 months as a result of the revocation of a community service order made on 4 December 2000.  
     
      
    13 When the matter came before Dodd DCJ, the respondent’s counsel submitted that this was an appropriate case for his Honour to make an order under s.11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It was proposed that the respondent spend a period of 12 months in a full-time residential programme at the Westside Mission. This is a well recognised treatment programme for seriously addicted drug users.  
     
      
    14 Section 11 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        11 Deferral of sentencing for rehabilitation, participation in an intervention program or other purposes 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A court that finds a person guilty of an offence (whether or not it proceeds to conviction) may make an order adjourning proceedings against the offender to a specified date, and granting bail to the offender in accordance with the

    15 Section 11 is the statutory enactment of a procedure which was known in colloquial legal parlance as a “Griffiths remand”: see Griffiths v. The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293.  
     
      
    16 The provisions of s.11 are wider in certain respects than was the position at common law under a Griffiths remand. Those differences are not relevant here. The only question that arises here is whether, by making an order under s.11, the sentencing judge thereby imposed a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    17 The Crown initially submitted that there was a question whether an adjournment should be granted under s.11 in a case where it is inevitable that the offender would be sent to gaol at the end of the adjourned period. However, as the Crown appeal was ultimately argued, it was submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to inform the respondent that it was likely he would receive a custodial sentence notwithstanding that the proceedings were to be adjourned for a period of 12 months to enable the respondent to demonstrate to the Court that rehabilitation had taken place. The Crown frankly conceded that had the judge made this clear to the respondent, the Crown would have “held its hand” and waited until the ultimate custodial sentence was imposed before giving consideration to the question whether the sentence was or was not appropriate.  
     
      
    18 There was no dispute in the case that an adjournment under s.11 was a “sentence” for the purposes of s.5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (NSW) 1912  against which an appeal could be brought.  
     
      
    19 The circumstances in which it is appropriate to grant a Griffiths remand was recently considered by this Court in R v. Trindall (2002) 133 A Crim R 119, where Smart AJ, (Spigelman CJ and Grove J agreeing), said at 64: 
     
      
       
        
        “The granting of a Griffiths remand is likely to arise for consideration in a relatively small number of cases. Generally, such a remand should not be granted unless there are good reasons for concluding that it is likely to assist the court in determining whether an offender should be sent to gaol or in fixing the length of the sentence or the non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    20 The circumstances in which it was appropriate to make an order under s.11 were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v. Palu (2002) 134 A Crim 174. In that case, Howie J, (Levine and Hidden JJ agreeing) after referring to Smart AJ’s statement, said at 29: 
     
      
       
        
        “As Smart AJ identified, the discretion conferred upon a sentencing judge by s.11 can be a valuable sentencing tool when used in an appropriate case for the purpose of arriving at a sentence which is just both for the offender and for the community”. 
        
       
      
    21 Of particular concern to Howie J was the possibility that unless used in a principled way, an adjournment under s.11 could itself become an instrument of injustice by, inter alia, “raising false expectations in the mind of the offender as to the sentence which will ultimately be imposed …”. In Palu, it had not been made clear to the accused that a custodial sentence was virtually inevitable in due course. There were other difficulties in that case which are not relevant here and do not require discussion.  
     
      
    22 This case is different from Palu. When counsel for the respondent submitted to the sentencing judge that an order under s.11 was appropriate he made the basis of his application quite clear. He said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, the basis of the submission would be, that it is not in lieu of any custodial sentence that your Honour might ultimately impose, but it is to essentially front-end load the rehabilitation process” (AB 17). 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour expressed concern at the suggested procedure, making a comment to the effect that it was not appropriate to undergo rehabilitation as proposed “and then try and go back into custody”. Counsel responded to his Honour’s concern by submitting that the purpose of the adjournment in this case would be so as to assist the process of determining “an appropriate non-parole period (AB 17) … [i]f your Honour was persuaded to refer him, you would necessarily be persuaded these are matters and this is an offender to whom special circumstances apply. So it would be on a next occasion if he was to be successful [on the application for an order under s.11] if (a) your Honour was to refer him (b) it was to be successful, it would be submissions in respect to an appropriate non-parole period and a longer than normal period of parole where he was to continue or do what your Honour directed him” (AB 18).  
     
      
    24 The application was opposed by the Crown. In doing so the Crown referred the Court to the annotations in the Butterworths Practice that “the use of such a procedure will rarely be appropriate where the ultimate sentence which must be passed is a custodial order, although it might be done in order to allow the offender to complete a rehabilitation programme which would otherwise be disrupted” (AB 18). The Crown submitted that rehabilitation would not be disrupted, (because the rehabilitation programme had not commenced) and that the making of an order in a case such as this would be “unrealistic”.  
     
      
    25 After hearing evidence on sentence, including the evidence of the respondent, the sentencing judge then commenced his Remarks on Sentence. He referred to the application for an order under s.11, observing that the respondent had already been in custody for a period of 5 months. His Honour considered that a discount of 25% was appropriate for the early plea of guilty. He made reference to the assistance which had been provided to authorities and expressed the view that a further discount of 25% was appropriate for that. He commented that a court must always be sceptical of assurances by prisoners that they had “turned the corner or come to the cross-roads”. However, his Honour found that even evaluating the evidence with “a significant degree of scepticism”: 
     
      
       
        
        “there is a significant chance, not only that you are genuine as to those matters, but that there is also a significant chance that you may be able to succeed given the right conditions in overcoming your current or past drug addiction” (AB 47). 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour also referred to the principles to be applied in circumstances where there were multiple offences: see Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Carrying out a purely mathematical exercise and without the discounts for the plea of guilty and your assistance to police, it seems to me that the appropriate head sentence would be in the vicinity of 5 years imprisonment. It does not take a mathematical genius to work out from that that with discounts the head sentence is in the vicinity of 2 years and 10 months with a non-parole period in the vicinity of 2 years and 2 months” (AB 48). 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour further observed that if he did accede to the application, even though it would be a condition that he attend Westside Mission, “time spent at Westside Mission, although restrictive of your liberty, could not be equated to a prison sentence” (AB 49). He concluded that the tension between the various competing objectives of sentencing were in this case appropriately resolved by a Griffiths remand. His Honour then made the following comments, which essentially became the focus of the challenge by the Crown to the grant of the Griffiths remand.  
     
      
       
        
        “If you do not comply with the conditions of that remand, then you can expect, as a high probability, that you will be brought back in breach of your bail conditions and sentenced to a further term of imprisonment” (AB 50). 
        
       
      
    28 The Crown submitted that it was apparent from these comments that as was the case in Palu, the order under s.11 was manifestly inadequate because it was not made clear to the respondent that a custodial sentence was still appropriate at the end of the period of adjournment.  
     
      
    29 In my opinion, this challenge fails. In the first place, I do not attach the same interpretation to this passage as did the Crown. Amongst other things, the Crown’s interpretation takes the passage out of context. His Honour added to that comment the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “I say that, not to preclude a proper consideration of any circumstances that may in the future arise, but so that you clearly understand that that is the probability 
         should you breach your bail conditions  
        of such a remand” (AB 40). 
        
       
       
      In these comments, his Honour was drawing to the respondent’s attention the consequences of a breach of the bail conditions. He was not referring to the ultimate outcome of the proceedings at the end of the remand period.  
       
      
    30 Further, there was no doubt that it was understood both by his Honour and by the respondent that a custodial sentence was possible and even likely in this case at the end of the remand period. The application for an order under s.11 was made on behalf of the respondent on that premise and it is clear from the entire exchange between his Honour and counsel and from the Remarks on Sentence that his Honour well knew that a custodial sentence in this case was appropriate and that the purpose of the remand was to enable the assessment of the respondent’s rehabilitation and also to enable a proper assessment of the appropriate non-parole period.  
     
      
    31 In my opinion therefore, as this was not a case where the respondent was left in any doubt as to the appropriateness of a custodial sentence and as no other challenge was made to the adequacy of the sentence, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    32 O’KEEFE J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    33 BELL J: I agree with Beazley JA.

      70012/01 Regina v CVH 
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE  
       
       
      Background 
       
      
    1 On 25 February 2002 CVH (the prisoner) was convicted by a jury of the manslaughter of Tremain Watene, assault on GF, and affray, all of which offences occurred at Campsie on 10 November 1997 at Lahood’s Amusement and Snooker Centre (Lahood’s). His offences were committed in concert with MTN and others and formed part of a joint attack on each of the victims. 
     
      
    2 The prisoner’s sentence hearing took place on 26 April 2002. Because of delays in obtaining relevant reports in relation to the prisoner’s co-offender the sentences for both of them were not handed down until 26 August 2002. The prisoner received the following sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) In respect of the manslaughter of Tremain Watene he was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2012. There was a finding of special circumstances and the non-parole period in respect of this offence was fixed at 6 years to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) In respect of the assault on GF he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2004. The sentence in respect of this offence was ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence for manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) In respect of the offence of affray he was sentence to a fixed term of imprisonment of one year to commence on 25 January 2002 and to expire on 24 January 2003. This sentence was also ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence for manslaughter. 
        
       
       
      The sentences referred to in (ii) and (iii) above have thus already expired. 
       
      
    3 The prisoner appealed against the severity of the sentences imposed on the following grounds that: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the sentencing proceedings miscarried because of the failure to comply with s 25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (the Act); 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) insufficient weight was given to the applicant’s youth at the time he committed the offences. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    4 The Court of Criminal Appeal (McColl JA, Grove and Dowd JJ) determined that the pre-sentence report tendered by the Crown at the sentence hearing, without objection on behalf of the prisoner, did not strictly comply with the provisions of Regulation 6(d), (e) and (f) of the regulations made under the Act. Those provisions require that the report relating to a prisoner to whom the Act applies must deal with the prisoner’s friends and associates (6(d)), the nature and extent of the prisoner’s participation in the life of the community (6(e)) and the prisoner’s disabilities (6(f)). Although many of the aspects required by the relevant regulation were before the court those referred to above were not. The Court of Criminal Appeal determined that there was no error demonstrated in the application of the principle of totality. However, because of the non-compliance with Regulation 6(d), (e) and (f) the matter was sent back for re-sentencing. It should be noted that in the Court of Criminal Appeal the question of the length of the sentence was not the subject of a determination.  
     
      
       
      STATUTORY MATTERS 
       
      
    5 The maximum penalty provided for manslaughter in s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for 25 years. The maximum penalties for the other two offences need not be considered further in view of the structuring of the sentence that is proposed and the fact that the times limited by the sentences previously imposed have already expired.  
     
      
    6 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act) makes provision for regard to be had to a number of considerations. The primary obligation of the Court is to impose a sentence that is appropriate to all the circumstances of the case. (s 21A(1)). For that purpose the Court must take into account the matters specified in s 21A(2) and (3) of the Sentencing Act. Those referred to in s 21A(2)(b) (c), (d), (e), (g), (i), (l) and (n), are relevant as are those specified in s21A(3)(i) and (j). In addition in imposing a sentence the Court must take into account any time which the offender has spent in custody in relation to the particular offence (s 24(a)). Furthermore, the age and antecedents of the prisoner are relevant considerations. So too is the effect of the offence on the victim and the family of the victim. However, this factor and its effect are to be understood in the manner defined in the decided cases. 
     
      
    7 Because of the age of the prisoner at the time he committed the offence for which he is to be sentenced, the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 must be taken into account. The youth of the prisoner at the time of the commission of the offences is a matter of considerable importance and in determining the sentences to be imposed in the present casse, I have had regard to this factor and to the other matters referred to in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Reference is to be made to such Act and its effect later in these reasons.  
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      
    8 For the purposes of re-sentencing the prisoner I adopt the matters and findings of fact in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 of my Remarks on Sentence of 26 August 2002. I also adopt paragraphs 39, 40, 41, 42, 49, 50 (subparagraphs 1 to 6 inclusive), 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 69 of such Remarks on Sentence. 
     
      
       
      PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY OF THE PRISONER 
       
      
    9 When he was sentenced in August 2002 the prisoner had two convictions. The first offence was for shoplifting on 18 April 2000 for which he was fined $100.00 on 8 May 2000. The second offence was for supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis on 22 November 2000. He was sentenced in the Sydney District Court on 22 June 2001 to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years in respect of this offence. The criminal record of the prisoner tendered in the present proceedings does not reveal any additional offences.  
     
      
       
      PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PRISONER 
       
      
    10 As indicated above, for the purposes of the present proceedings I adopt paragraphs 39, 40, 41, 42, 49 and 50 (sub paragraphs 1-6 inclusive) of my remarks on sentence of 26 August 2002. A report from the Department of Juvenile Justice was also tendered by the Crown. It was agreed that it was in accordance with the requirements of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and the regulations made under such Act. It reveals in essence the facts referred to in paragraph 8 above, however, there is additional information concerning the prisoner’s two older brothers, namely, that they had recently been released from prison for drug charges and were staying with the prisoner’s mother who is unemployed. The prisoner reported a history of positive relationships with his mother and siblings but not with his father since the age of 14, when his mother and father separated. 
     
      
    11 The report reveals that he began to use cannabis shortly after the separation of his parents and by age 15 he was smoking heroin on a daily basis, however, this was not, according to him, as a result of anything done by his brothers. The report further reveals that after spending some 10 months on remand at a Juvenile Justice Centre as a result of the current offences, he was released in October 1998 and moved to Vietnam where he remained for six months with his grand parents. He said this was done to address his drug problem and avoid negative peer influence. 
     
      
    12 He returned to Australia in 1999 and rapidly became a heroin user again, however, by that time he was injecting the heroin rather than smoking it. 
     
      
    13 At age 18 the prisoner was remanded in adult custody for drug offences the sentence for which he has now completed. However he has remained in custody because of the current convictions in respect of which he now stands for sentence. 
     
      
    14 During the last three years that the prisoner has been in adult custody his mother has remained in close contact with him and his sister has also visited him. The prisoner claims a positive relationship with his mother and siblings, that she has always been supportive and has indicated her intention to continue this support for the foreseeable future. 
     
      
    15 During the time of his remand in the Juvenile Justice Centre he attended alcohol and other drug counselling, but after his release from that centre he did not continue with or undertake any further counselling or intervention. Since his imprisonment for the current offences he has, however, undertaken a number of courses. These are: 
     
      
    · a seven week course in relapse prevention (June 2002); 
     
      
    · “Writing for Self Expression” (May 2003); 
     
      
    · “Raising Awareness for Change (20 June 2003). This course included topics such as Facilitating Change, Self Esteem, Communication, Drug and Alcohol Awareness, Gambling Awareness and Vocational Orientation; 
     
      
    · Obtaining partial certificates in General Education for Adults Foundation (August 2003); 
     
      
    · Obtaining two certificates (2.6 and 2.7) in “Reading for Practical Purposes”; 
     
      
    · Completing level 2 “Anger Management”, level 2 “English” and a TAFE ESL course. 
     
      
       
      Whilst the content of some of these courses is unknown it is apparent that since his last sentence hearing the prisoner has undertaken a number of recognised courses within the prison system and I am of opinion that this is a positive feature for the prisoner. There was no evidence of such a kind at his sentence hearing in April 2002. 
       
      
    16 On the last occasion he was before me the prisoner did not give any evidence of remorse. He has, however, given such evidence at this hearing. Although this gave an impression of having been rehearsed, this could have been because of his limited command of English. Moreover, in a statement dated 27 August 2002 in which he applied for an opportunity to engage in an educational programme he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I am remorseful for the crime I have committed I feel it isn’t enough to prevent it from happening again. 
        
       
       
        
        This programme can help me beneficially. I hope you give me the opportunity to become a better person through this programme.” 
        
       
      
    17 It is clear from the documentation tendered that the prisoner was permitted to take part in the educational programme from which I infer that the prison authorities took the view that he was a worthwhile prospect for programmes of such a kind.  
     
      
    18 The foregoing indicates a change of attitude on the part of the prisoner. He has matched words with action, has deposed to his remorse and I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt in relation to remorse, although I still have some doubts about this matter.  
     
      
    19 The prisoner told the Juvenile Justice officer that he has no intention of being involved in further violent behaviour for the rest of his life. This statement is laudable, but does not sit well with the fact that a urine test in May 2003 was described in the prison records as “dirty”. He is, however, polite and courteous to staff and has been employed in the laundry shop and the packing shop. In September 2003 his Correctional Service case notes state: 
     
      
       
        
        “There have been no adverse reports on his running sheets. Fits in well with the wing.” 
        
       
      
    20 The prisoner denied that he was a member of any gang and informed the Juvenile Justice officer who prepared the report that was tendered to the court that at the time of the relevant offences he “was spending all his time with his co-offenders and other heroin users.” He said that he had not remained in contact with his co-offenders and other drug-using peers and does not intend to ever contact them again. I do not accept his denial in relation to his gang membership. As far as his co-offenders are concerned, being in prison would prevent him from making contact unless they were in the same prison and his statement about not initiating contact with other heroin users does not sit well with the matters referred to in paragraph 19 above.  
     
      
    21 The version of events given to the Juvenile Justice officer is quite self serving and inconsistent both with the verdict of the jury and my own findings of fact. Whilst it is understandable that the prisoner would wish to paint himself in as good a light as possible, his refusal or inability to face the facts as they are, poses problems for his rehabilitation. Admission of criminality is often a first step towards rehabilitation. The Juvenile Justice officer notes that “his honesty in regard to his account is questionable.” This, in my opinion, puts a complexion on his statements that is more favourable than the facts really allow.  
     
      
    22 The conclusion in the report from the Department of Juvenile Justice adverts to the prisoner’s vulnerability at the time the offence was committed due to his drug addiction, the fact that he lived in a troubled area and lacked a male role model. These are factors that I take into account in imposing the sentences for the offences for which the prisoner is to be re-sentenced. However, the prisoner’s problem with heroin is seen as a significant factor in relation to his future, so too is his need for further education. I think that heroin addiction remains a real problem. 
     
      
       
      SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PRISONER 
       
      
    23 At the forefront of the submissions on behalf of the prisoner is his youth at the time he committed the offences for which he is to be sentenced. It is a highly relevant matter and I take it into account. The principles embodied in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 apply. That which is relied on most heavily is the principle of taking into consideration that children who commit offences must bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance (GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112). 
     
      
    24 It is important in applying these principles to note that responsibility for their actions is part of the same consideration that requires their state of dependency, immaturity and need for guidance to be taken into account. They are considerations that will have varying effect according to the circumstances of the case. Where young offenders act like adults and commit adult crimes that are serious they may attract less leniency in sentencing than their age might otherwise support. However, where immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence then it may be fairly said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of mature years. Generally, the younger the offender the greater the weight to be given to the element of youth. Furthermore, the considerations of general deterrence are not of the same weight for a young person as they are for an adult. I take these considerations into account in fixing the sentences.  
     
      
    25 In the course of the submissions reference was made to the sentences imposed on other persons who were involved in events at Lahoods on 10 November 1997. I do not think that these references are of assistance. JD received a sentence of 2 years imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a 12 month bond for the offence of affray. He pleaded guilty and assisted the authorities; indeed his evidence was significant in the trial of the prisoner. Andre Nasr received a sentence of 18 months periodic detention and a 12 month concurrent sentence for affray. He too pleaded guilty and gave evidence against MTN at his joint trial with the prisoner. HDN did not plead guilty. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 10 months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray. His minimum term was fixed at 22 months and 18 days. 
     
      
    26 None of the persons referred to in paragraph 25 was convicted of an offence of the seriousness of that for which the prisoner was convicted and I do not think that any real assistance is obtained from the sentences imposed, particularly when regard is had to the spectrum of such sentences. 
     
      
    27 The written submissions on behalf of the prisoner also addressed the question of totality. Reference is made to the sentence of 3 years that was imposed on the prisoner on 22 June 2001 for the supply of prohibited drugs. It was submitted that some regard should be had to this fact when considering the commencement date of the sentences to be imposed. I do not agree. The offence for which the prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment for three years was quite independent of the present offences. It was a drug offence. It was committed at a different place. It was committed at a different time. It was committed in different circumstances. To discount the appropriate sentence for the crimes for which the prisoner is now to be sentenced would in my opinion have the effect of giving him a benefit for his other criminality and send the wrong message to other persons who may be inclined to act as the prisoner acted on 10 November 1997. 
     
      
       
      STATISTICS 
       
      
    28 The statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in relation to penalties imposed for manslaughter were referred to. They show that in some 90 percent of the cases a sentence of imprisonment was imposed. In the submissions made on behalf of the prisoner reference was made to the median term derived from the statistics. In my opinion there are difficulties in using this mathematical concept as a datum. The first source of difficulty is the very nature of the crime of manslaughter itself. The second is the wide range of sentences revealed in the statistics. A third is that adverted to by the High Court in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 in which Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… to attempt some statistical analysis of sentences for an offence which encompasses a very wide range of conduct and criminality … is fraught with danger, especially if the number of examples is small. It pretends to mathematical accuracy of analysis where accuracy is not possible. It may be mathematically possible to say of 20 or 30 examples of an offence … where the median or mean sentence lies. But to give any significance to the figure which is identified assumes a relationship between all members of the sample which cannot be assumed in so small a sample. To take only one difficulty, why were the highest and lowest sentences set as they were? (at 608) 
        
       
      
    29 Notwithstanding these difficulties, but bearing them in mind, it may still be of some assistance to consider the various statistics. The range of sentences revealed by the statistics relating to manslaughter is from 18 months to 20 years. The statistics also show that the head sentences in 80 percent of the cases range from 6 years to 14 years, with more than 33 1/3 percent of the sentences falling between 8 years and 14 years and that in just over 33 1/3 percent of the cases the non-parole periods range from 5 to 10 years. The outliers in the statistics, that is, head sentences below 4 years or above 14 years, account for only 11 percent of the sentences. It is highly likely that these sentences were imposed in respect of manslaughters committed in circumstances that were especially heinous on the one hand or of low culpability on the other.  
     
      
    30 The present case is not at the very high end of the spectrum of culpability nor is it in the lower levels of culpability. It was, as I have found, a deliberate group crime. It involved gratuitous violence. It involved planning. It involved a body of young men combining to attack two other young men. It was seen by the attackers, including the prisoner, as an act of revenge. It resulted in the death of one young man and the wounding of another. A clear message needs to be sent that such behaviour will be viewed by the courts in a most serious manner by the imposition of a condign penalty, even though the prisoner was a young person at the time of the offences.  
     
      
     
     
      
       
      
     
     
      
      CONCLUSION 
       
      
    31 When regard is had to the objective seriousness of the crime of manslaughter, the circumstances in which the subject manslaughter was committed and the subjective factors to which I have referred above, including the prisoner’s youth, the remorse expressed by him, his attempts to improve his lot whilst in prison and his apparently changed attitude since he was sentenced, I am of opinion that the sentence for manslaughter now to imposed on the prisoner should be reduced from 10 years to 8 ½ years and in view of the special circumstances I am of opinion that the non-parole period should be reduced from 6 years to 5 years. However, I do not think that the sentences imposed on the prisoner on 26 August 2002 in respect of the malicious wounding of GF and affray should be altered.

     REGINA v Sean Leigh CAMPTON 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Kirby J. I agree that the account his Honour has given is indicative of error in the sentencing process. The facts and circumstances outlined pointed to a full-time custodial sentence. The respondent’s previous history of drink-driving, his driving of an unregistered motor vehicle whilst unlicensed, his conduct at the scene in absconding, and his subsequent untruthfulness, are all factors that militated against leniency. 
     
      
    2 But there is one additional circumstance which, although plainly known to the sentencing judge, appears to have been given only passing attention in the District Court, and never became the focus of real discussion in this Court. That was this. The offence was committed on 7 August 2001. The respondent was arrested and charged on the same day. He was not ultimately sentenced until 19 September 2003 – more than two years after the offence. That was not attributable to any fault or delaying tactic on the part of the respondent. It occurred because the Crown persisted in charging the respondent with the aggravated form of the offence. When, on 26 March 2003, the Crown signified its acceptance of the respondent’s proffered plea of guilty to the alternative charge, the respondent entered that plea promptly. Evidence on the sentence was given, and submissions made, on 17 June 2003. That was followed by a further three months’ adjournment. Transcript of the proceedings shows that this came about because her Honour had been urged to give consideration to ordering that the respondent serve his sentence by way of periodic detention. At that time the respondent was living in Queensland, and it would be necessary, if a periodic detention order were to be made, that he relocate to NSW, and make appropriate accommodation arrangements. In this context it should be pointed out that her Honour was at pains to make it clear that she was far from convinced that such an order would or should be made. She was merely giving the respondent the opportunity to put himself in a position that would enable him to obtain the benefit of such an order, were she persuaded to make it. 
     
      
    3 It was on resumption of the proceedings on 19 September that the respondent was finally sentenced. By that date the respondent had taken full advantage of the time available to him and achieved commendable rehabilitation. Nevertheless, having regard to the accumulation of aggravating circumstances, it is still arguable that no sentence other one involving some period of full-time custody was, as of that date, adequate to meet the whole of the circumstances. The observations of Kirby J in paragraph 68 are apposite and of considerable force. It may well be that, even at that late stage, her Honour ought to have sentenced the respondent to full-time imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 I do not find it necessary to reach a final view on that matter because that does not conclude the history. In the submissions filed in this Court, the Crown acknowledged that the notice of appeal was not signed until 31 October, seven weeks after sentencing, and was served on the respondent on 5 November. The respondent’s sentence having commenced on 3 October, he had, by then, served four of the periods specified, and had in fact relocated to NSW. 
     
      
    5 Delay (whether delay in relation to which blame should be assigned or not) can be a relevant factor in the exercise of this Court’s residual discretion to dismiss an otherwise meritorious Crown appeal: Regina v Kyroglou & Tsoukatos [1999] NSWCCA 106. In my opinion this is a case where the lapse of time between the offence and the determination of the Crown appeal is relevant. It is not necessary, in reaching that conclusion, to find fault with the Crown in relation to either period of delay. The delay is a fact, as is the change in the respondent’s personal situation. In my opinion, this is a case where the Court’s residual discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal, even where error has been shown, should be exercised. 
     
      
    6 KIRBY J: This is an appeal against sentence by the Crown. Mr Sean Leigh Campton (the respondent) pleaded guilty to one count of Dangerous Driving occasioning grievous bodily harm (s52A(3)(a) Crimes Act 1900). On 19 September 2003 he was sentenced by Tupman DCJ to 2-1/2 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 1-1/2 years, such sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. The Crown alleges that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      The Incident. 
       
      
    7 Mr Campton lived with his girlfriend. Both were heroin addicts. He had trained as a jockey and at one time had a promising career. However, at the time of the offence he had not worked for six months. He had little money. On Monday 6 August 2001 he had a bitter argument with his girlfriend and then felt depressed. As he was later to describe, his life was ""at its lowest ebb"". 
     
      
    8 During the course of that day Mr Campton went to an hotel in Merrylands. He drank beer and spirits. He later drove to another hotel at Rydalmere. He continued drinking. He could not say how much he had drunk. 
     
      
    9 In the early hours of Tuesday 7 August 2001, Mr Campton decided to drive to the Albion Hotel at Rose Hill. He was joined by a passenger, a person he had met that night. Whilst driving along Harris Street, Harris Park, and approaching the intersection of Parkes Street, he went through a red light. He collided with a vehicle driven by Mr Cole. Mr Cole, of course, had the green light. 
     
      
    10 Mr Campton's vehicle mounted the kerb and knocked down the traffic control lights. It then spun around, hitting a brick fence. Mr Cole's vehicle also spun around and mounted the kerb. It knocked down a brick fence, and came to rest in the front yard of a block of units. 
     
      
    11 Mr Cole was trapped inside his car. He did not lose consciousness. However, he was injured and in some pain. He had a head wound which was bleeding. Emergency workers were summoned. They cut open his vehicle to remove him from the wreck. He was taken to hospital, where he remained for three weeks. Both vehicles were damaged beyond repair. 
     
      
    12 Mr Campton was able to get out of his vehicle, as was his passenger. He said that he panicked. He ran along Parkes Street, as did his companion. They hid in the driveway of a home. However, their flight was witnessed by a number of people. They were soon found by the police. When questioned, Mr Campton said he was not the driver. He told the police that his companion was the driver, which his companion denied. Mr Campton's face was covered with blood. Both he and his passenger smelt of alcohol. Mr Campton was taken by ambulance to hospital. 
     
      
    13 Mr Campton's passenger had a diagonal burn across his body, corresponding with the seat belt on the passenger's side of the vehicle. A photograph was taken of the burns. It was plain that Mr Campton was the driver. 
     
      
    14 Mr Campton's vehicle was unregistered and uninsured. Mr Campton himself was unlicensed. His licence had been suspended because of unpaid traffic fines. His blood alcohol reading was 0.14. The offence of Aggravated Dangerous Driving occasioning grievous bodily harm arises where the person charged has a blood alcohol reading of 0.15 (s52A(4) and (7)). The maximum penalty for that offence is 11 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offence to which Mr Campton had pleaded guilty (s52A(3)(a)) is 7 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    15 Mr Campton was again interviewed by the police on 3 December 2001. On this occasion he acknowledged that he was the driver of the vehicle. He was charged. He pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. Her Honour discounted the sentence by 25% by reason of that plea. 
     
      
    16 Mr Campton was injured in the collision. He remained in hospital for a number of days. His injuries, however, were not serious. The victim, Mr Cole, was not so fortunate. Her Honour found that he had sustained the following injuries: (R/S p7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I do however ... accept that he [Mr Cole] suffered the following injuries: a fractured right little finger, fractured sternum, and injury to his left clavicle or collarbone, a haematoma to his left hamstring muscle, a seatbelt burn to his right shoulder and a macerated injury to his right forearm muscle requiring debridement and flap operation as part of the treatment and recovery process."" 
        
       
      
    17 Mr Cole was a security guard. He has been left with a number of permanent disabilities. He had ""bad scarring"" to his right shoulder, the result of surgery, and pain in the shoulder. He had reduced strength in his right arm. Her Honour accepted that Mr Cole now experienced pain on a daily basis. He also suffered from post traumatic reactive syndrome, disturbing his sleep, causing flashbacks and tending to make him irritable.  
     
      
       
      The Subjective Case. 
       
      
    18 At the time of sentence Mr Campton was 31 years old. He was born on 16 February 1972. His father had been a successful jockey and later a trainer. Mr Campton was not especially academic. He left school at the age of 14 years and began his apprenticeship as a jockey. He completed that apprenticeship by the age of 21. For a number of years he was a leading apprentice in Newcastle. He also rode in Sydney. 
     
      
    19 In 1991 Mr Campton had a severe fall during a race. He suffered a serious fracture of his leg in which an artery was severed. The injury became gangrenous, such that amputation was contemplated. Whilst in hospital he was given pethidine. Her Honour accepted that the drugs administered at this time were implicated in his later use of illegal drugs. 
     
      
    20 When Mr Campton was about 20 he began experimentation with drugs at parties. He used ecstasy and amphetamines. At the age of 27 years he began using heroin, as did his partner. He ultimately became addicted, sometimes using heroin daily. His life became chaotic and disorganised. Heroin was not, however, a factor in the accident. 
     
      
    21 Strangely, the accident appears to have brought Mr Campton to his senses. Her Honour described his determined rehabilitation in these words: (R/S p15-16) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... once the prisoner was released from hospital after about four days he took his life in hand. He split up with his partner and went to stay with some friends in Sydney. He withdrew from heroin, going onto a methadone program for about three weeks, and then stopped using that and heroin as well. He stayed with these friends in Sydney for about two months after leaving hospital, completing this drug withdrawal and rehabilitation. He started seeing a psychiatrist for about three sessions for post trauma counselling and has been treated on a long term basis by Dr De Costa. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that he has made an extremely good recovery from his heroin addiction and the depression that surrounded him at the time he committed this offence. I accept that he has not used any illegal drugs since the time of this offence. 
        
       
       
        
        He pulled his life together following this offence and his detoxification from heroin use, to the extent that he then went to live on the Gold Coast with his mother, as I understand the evidence, in about 2001, early 2002. He has continued to reside there until now. He had a professional jockey's licence to ride in Queensland and worked there as a professional jockey, mainly on the Gold Coast but also in rural Queensland."" 
        
       
      
    22 Referring to Mr Campton's decision not to seek the renewal of his licence, her Honour added: (R/S p16) 
     
      
       
        
        ""He has not sought to renew his driver's licence, either in New South Wales or Queensland, since the offence, even though he would have been able to do so up until March 2003 when I imposed a bail condition preventing him from driving after he entered the plea of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that this has been his own decision and that he did so because of the impact this offence has had on him and the guilt, shame and remorse he feels for having committed it. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that the prisoner has completely rehabilitated himself from the life he was leading at the time he committed this offence."" 
        
       
      
    23 Her Honour noted that Mr Campton had not only ""turned his life around"" but, in the two years following the accident, had managed to keep his life ""on an even keel"" (R/S p18). 
     
      
    24 At the time of these events Mr Campton had a criminal record. He had been convicted at the Parramatta Local Court on 5 January 1994 with having driven with a middle range concentration of alcohol. He was fined and disqualified from driving for six months. In the same proceedings, he was also dealt with in respect of charges of having driven whilst his licence was cancelled, and driven an unregistered and uninsured vehicle. His general driving record was also poor. His licence had been suspended on a number of occasions, either through loss of points or the accumulation of unpaid fines. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing Remarks. 
       
      
    25 Her Honour, in her remarks on sentence, referred to the Guideline judgments dealing with offences under s52A Crimes Act 1900, R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. She helpfully framed her findings by reference to the criteria identified by those judgments. It may be useful to refer to the guidelines and then to her Honour's findings. 
     
      
    26 The offence under s52A involves driving a motor vehicle in circumstances of an impact occasioning death or grievous bodily harm. The presence or absence of a number of ""factors"", and the degree to which they are present, will determine the appropriate penalty (R v Jurisic (supra: at 231)). In Jurisic the factors were enumerated as follows: (at 231) 
     
      
       
        
        ""(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Degree of speed. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Erratic driving. 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Competitive driving or showing off. 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) Ignoring warnings. 
        
       
       
        
        (ix) Escaping police pursuit."" 
        
       
      
    27 The first two matters focus upon the occurrence. The remaining matters related to the conduct of the offender. Referring to paragraphs which deal with the conduct of the offender, Spigelman CJ said this: (at 231) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The presence of these latter factors may indicate that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence."" 
        
       
      
    28 Within that context, the Court promulgated the following guidelines: (at 231) 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgment."" 
        
       
       
        
        2. With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional."" 
        
       
      
    29 The Court emphasised, however, that its judgment was a guideline. It was not meant to erode or eliminate the sentencing Judge's discretion. In R v Whyte (supra) the guidelines were reformulated to ensure that their tone was less prescriptive. The first limb was expressed in these terms: (at 286 para 214) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment."" 
        
       
      
    30 The second limb was expressed as follows: (at 286 para 214) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate."" 
        
       
      
    31 Dealing with those matters relevant to the occurrence, her Honour made the following findings: 
     
      
    · First, that the injuries to Mr Cole were not the most serious that might be seen in cases of grievous bodily harm. Neither were they at the bottom of the range (R/S 8).· Secondly, the passenger was put at risk, as was Mr Cole. 
     
      
    32 In respect of those issues relevant to Mr Campton's moral responsibility, her Honour said this: (R/S 9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... there is present a degree of intoxication which is more than minimal. The prisoner's blood alcohol reading was .14 percent. That is just less than the high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. That is an aggravating factor present to a reasonable extent in this case."" 
        
       
      
    33 Her Honour accepted that Mr Campton was not in the habit of drinking a lot of alcohol. He was a person of slight build and that may have magnified the blood alcohol reading. She then said this: (R/S 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Nonetheless, at the time he must have realised that his driving ability was impaired. He chose to get behind the wheel of his car, however, and drive to the other venue. Not only that, but he had a passenger with him when he made that choice. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence allows for only one finding in relation to the cause of the accident, namely, that his alcohol level impaired his ability to drive safely and to stop at the red light."" 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Campton gave evidence. He estimated that he had driven ten kilometres before the collision. Her Honour accepted that his estimate may have overstated the journey undertaken. She determined that, in the circumstances before her, distance was not an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    35 The Crown on this appeal has complained about that finding. The length of the journey, during which others are exposed to risk, is a specific matter identified in Jurisic (supra: para 26). It ought to have formed part of her Honour's assessment. It was said on behalf of Mr Campton that, as a matter of geography, the distance between the hotel at Rydalmere and the point of collision was significantly less than ten kilometres. 
     
      
    36 There is merit both in the position of the Crown and the respondent. Distance was a factor identified by Jurisic. Plainly a journey of some distance was made between Rydalmere and the point of impact during which Mr Campton was affected by alcohol. However, the distance appears to have been significantly less than ten kilometres. It was a factor, but not a large factor. 
     
      
    37 There were other matters, however, which did reflect adversely upon Mr Campton, and therefore his moral culpability, namely: 
     
      
    · The fact that he had left the scene, and then attempted to blame his passenger.· The fact that he was unlicensed and the vehicle that he was driving was both unregistered and uninsured. 
     
      
    38 Directing her attention to the first limb of the guidelines, her Honour made the following finding: (R/S 11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This is not a case where the collision occurred as a result of any momentary inattention on the part of the prisoner. The collision occurred because he was driving under the influence of alcohol. That much is [conceded] by his plea of guilty. As I have said, it was a relatively high reading of .14, just below the high range prescribed concentration of alcohol."" 
        
       
      
    39 Given the aggravating factors which were present, her Honour's conclusion (addressing the second limb) was in these terms: (R/S 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It seems to me, in looking at all of those factors, that this is an example of this particular offence towards the middle of the range in terms of seriousness. On an objective assessment his moral culpability is not at the top of the range but nor was it at the bottom. There is a continuum and it seems to me that he was at about the middle of that continuum in terms of his moral culpability."" 
        
       
      
    40 Her Honour added: (R/S 12/13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""On an objective assessment, and taking into account the guideline set by the Court of Criminal Appeal, a sentencing court would be looking to impose a full time sentence of imprisonment of about two and a half years, even taking into account the fact that this is an early plea of guilty."" 
        
       
      
    41 Her Honour then dealt with the powerful subjective case presented on behalf of Mr Campton, and especially the rehabilitation through his own efforts, as set out above. He had changed his life. He was no longer using drugs. He had recognised that his associates were part of the problem. He no longer mixed with such people. He had moved to the Gold Coast, where he lived with his mother. He had resumed his career as a professional jockey. 
     
      
    42 Upon the basis of these findings her Honour said this: (R/S 18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This offence, even taking into account the subjective factors, clearly calls for a prison term. It seems to me that, taking into account the aggravating factors, and even allowing for the fact that this is an early plea of guilty and, after taking into account those subjective factors, an overall term of imprisonment of two and a half years would be appropriate."" 
        
       
      
    43 Her Honour found special circumstances. This was Mr Campton's first term of imprisonment. Given his background, which I take to be a reference to drugs, ""he would benefit from a longer period of supervision in the community"". Her Honour fixed a non parole period of 18 months (R/S 19). 
     
      
    44 Her Honour then turned to the manner in which the prison term should be served. She said this: (R/S 19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Had it not been for the exceptional steps that this prisoner has taken to turn his life around since committing this offence, it seems to me that there would be no other option but to order that it be served full time."" 
        
       
      
    45 However, her Honour believed that the ""remarkable steps"" taken by Mr Campton ""towards his own rehabilitation"" made periodic detention appropriate. She said this: (R/S 19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Even though the offence itself was not committed because of his use of heroin, nonetheless he had in large part, because of his use of illegal drugs, allowed his life to reach the stage where he put himself in a position to commit this particular offence on this particular night. He has through his own efforts rehabilitated himself since that night and climbed back from the abyss. His demonstrated rehabilitation, it seems to me, would be significantly undermined if he were required to serve this sentence full time."" 
        
       
      
    46 An order for periodic detention was not feasible so long as Mr Campton remained on the Gold Coast. The closest centre was Grafton. Mr Campton would have to use public transport, which was difficult, and would involve a long journey. To take advantage of periodic detention, Mr Campton would need to move to Sydney, which he was prepared to do, as was his mother. Her Honour said this: (R/S 20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""That will be a hard sentence for this particular prisoner because of the impact that it will have on him, requiring him to relocate to Sydney, give up his established career and income in Queensland and to earn a significantly reduced income and reduced career opportunities whilst riding in track work in Sydney. It seems to me, however, that it is an option that is much less likely to interfere with his demonstrated rehabilitation than an order that he serve that non parole period full time."" 
        
       
      
    47 Her Honour added: (R/S 20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is for that reason that I propose to order that the non parole period be served by way of periodic detention, he having been found suitable to do so by the Probation and Parole Service."" 
        
       
       
      Submissions by the Parties. 
       
      
    48 The Crown submitted the sentence was manifestly inadequate. It was not a case of momentary inattention or misjudgement. There was, as her Honour recognised, a degree of moral culpability arising especially from the amount of alcohol consumed by Mr Campton, and also from his flight from the scene, as well as the fact that he was unlicensed and his vehicle unregistered. By reference to the guidelines, a full time custodial sentence was required. 
     
      
    49 The Crown said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""24. It appears the sentencing Judge in the present case fell into error by fixing a head sentence by reference only to the objective seriousness of the offence and by considering only subjective features of the respondent in determining the manner in which the sentence was to be served."" 
        
       
      
    50 Her Honour, according to the Crown, had decided that the sentence should be served by way of periodic detention solely upon the basis that Mr Campton had rehabilitated himself.  
     
      
    51 The Crown also drew attention to a number of cases in which offenders had been sentenced under s52A(3)(a). In each case a custodial sentence had been imposed. Most were appeals by the offender against the severity of the sentence: R v Gleeson [2000] NSWCCA 101; R v Ardron [2000] NSWCCA 412; R v Park [2001] NSWCCA 313. One, R v Romanic [2000] NSWCCA 524, was a Crown appeal. 
     
      
    52 It is instructive to examine the Crown appeal. In R v Romanic the offender was a fifty year old man. He had a successful business as a gyprocker. He was well regarded within the community. Whilst affected by alcohol he crossed onto the incorrect side of the road, colliding with an oncoming vehicle. The occupants of that vehicle were quite seriously injured. Both suffered various fractures. A sample was taken of Mr Romanic's blood, although there was some delay in doing so. The delay led to a debate as to the likely reading at the time the offence was committed. Dr Moynhan gave evidence that the likely range of blood alcohol was between 0.116 and 0.297. The sentencing Judge found that Mr Romanic had abandoned responsibility for his conduct. However, by reason of his strong subjective case, he sentenced Mr Romanic to 22 months imprisonment with a non parole period of 18 months, such sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    53 Wood CJ at CL (with whom Dunford J and Carruthers AJ agreed) said this: (at para 22) 
     
      
       
        
        ""22. It is evident that it was, because of those circumstances, that his Honour concluded that the sentence of imprisonment which he considered appropriate should be served by way of periodic detention, notwithstanding the clear direction in  
        Jurisic  
        that a non-custodial sentence for a section 52A offence, should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention and/or misjudgment. This was not a case of that kind."" 
        
       
      
    54 Periodic detention involved a strong element of leniency. Wood CJ at CL proposed the following order, with which other members of the Court agreed: (at para 34) 
     
      
       
        
        ""34. In that regard, I think it appropriate to make some allowance for his age and also to give him full credit for the period of three months periodic detention which he has served. Having regard to the principle of double jeopardy I would propose that in lieu of the sentence below the respondent be sentenced to a period of imprisonment for 12 months, to commence from today, with a non-parole period of 9 months, similarly to commence from today and to expire on 27 August 2001. That would be the date on which the respondent would be eligible for release on parole."" 
        
       
      
    55 Responding to the Crown's submissions, counsel for Mr Campton drew attention to the principles which should guide a Crown appeal. Such appeals should be rare. Intervention by this Court should be exceptional. The Crown must show that the sentence was so far outside the permissible range of the proper exercise of discretion as to require the intervention of this Court (Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 309-310; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 341; R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561). 
     
      
    56 Here, according to the respondent, there was no compelling reason to intervene. The guideline judgments were indicative only. The broad sentencing discretion had been preserved (Jurisic (supra: Spigelman CJ at 220-221)). Her Honour well understood the serious nature of the offence. She took account of the fact that periodic detention for the offender would have a far greater impact than in the case of other offenders. She fashioned a sentence best designed to both punish the offender and preserve the rehabilitation which had been won. 
     
      
    57 The respondent submitted that, even were the Court to find that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, it would not intervene on discretionary grounds. 
     
      
       
      Was there Error? 
       
      
    58 There can be little doubt that the terms of the guideline judgments suggest that a person exhibiting the moral culpability of Mr Campton (as found by her Honour) would ordinarily expect to be sentenced to a term of full time custody, whatever his subjective circumstances.  
     
      
    59 But was there error in determining the sentence should be served by way of periodic detention? Error is not demonstrated simply by pointing to a departure from the guidelines. The Chief Justice in Jurisic, and more recently in Whyte, emphasised the discretion which remains with the sentencing Judge. In Whyte (supra) he said this: (at 276) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The maintenance of a broad sentencing discretion is essential to ensure that all of the wide variations of circumstances of the offence and the offender are taken into account. Sentences must be individualised. The final balance of a wide variety of incommensurable and often incompatible factors does not, I accept, involve a mathematical exercise."" 
        
       
      
    60 In Jurisic the Chief Justice also made the following comment: (at 221) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The existence of multiple objectives in sentencing -- rehabilitation, denunciation and deterrence -- permits individual judges to reflect quite different penal philosophies. This is not a bad thing in a field in which 'the only golden rule is that there is no golden rule' ( 
        Geddes 
         (1936) 365 SR (NSW) 55, 555 per Jordan CJ). Indeed, Judges reflect the wide range of differing views on such matters that exists in the community. However, there are limits to the permissible range of variation."" 
        
       
      
    61 What are those limits? It should be said that the guidelines were themselves the product of an examination of sentencing patterns. On these facts, was an order for periodic detention outside those limits, such that there was error? 
     
      
    62 R v Musumeci (unreported, CCA, 30.10.97) was a Crown appeal. The offender had been convicted of dangerous driving which had caused the death of a person. The conviction was under s52A of the Crimes Act, which had then recently been introduced. Mr Musumeci was sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months to be served by way of periodic detention. The following remarks by Hunt CJ at CL were specifically approved in Jurisic (supra: at 228). Hunt CJ at CL said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""This Court has held that a number of considerations which had to be taken into account when sentencing for culpable driving must also be taken into account when sentencing for this new offence of dangerous driving. 
        
       
       
        
        1. The legislature has always placed a premium upon human life, and the taking of a human life by driving a motor vehicle dangerously is to be regarded as a crime of some seriousness. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The real substance of the offence is not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of a human life. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Such is the need for public deterrence in this type of case, the youth of any offender is given less weight as a subjective matter than in other types of cases. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in such cases. 
        
       
       
        
        5. So for youthful offenders of good character, who are guilty of dangerous driving, therefore, the sentence must be seen to have a reasonable proportionality to the objective circumstances of the crime, and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to those objective circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Periodic detention has a strong element of leniency built into it and, as presently administered, it is usually no more punitive than a community service order. 
        
       
       
        
        7. The statement made by this Court in relation to the previous offence of culpable driving -- that it cannot be said that a full-time custodial sentence is required in every case -- continues to apply in relation to the new offence of dangerous driving. As that offence is committed even though the offender has had no more than a momentary or casual lapse of attention, there must always be room for a non-custodial sentence (although that does  
        not 
         mean that a non-custodial sentence is ordinarily appropriate in such a case) but the case in which a sentence other than one involving  
        full-time 
         custody is appropriate must be rarer for this new offence."" 
        
       
      
    63 These comments, although made in the context of dangerous driving causing death, can be readily adapted to the cognate offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm (Jurisic, per Spigelman CJ: supra at 228). In that offence, as in Dangerous Driving causing death, there is a need for public deterrence. The youth and good character of the offender are rather less important. Indeed, it was recognised in Jurisic that often serious motoring offences under s52A were committed by young males with impeccable subjective circumstances. In Whyte (supra) Spigelman CJ said this: (at 284) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A frequently recurring case of an offence under s52A has the following characteristics. 
        
       
       
        
        (i) Young offender. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) The victim is a stranger. 
        
       
       
        
        (v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates. 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Genuine remorse. 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. 
        
       
       
        
        As the Parliament has made clear, in the maximum penalties for the offence, conduct which causes death or grievous bodily harm, even in the absence of any intention to cause such injury, is to be regarded as a serious crime."" 
        
       
      
    64 The touchstone for the sentencing Judge, when determining whether full time custody is appropriate, is the degree of moral culpability exhibited by the offender when committing the offence (R v Whyte (supra: per Spigelman CJ at 284 para 205)). 
     
      
    65 In R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, Howie J analysed the issues which a Judge must confront when sentencing under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (cf R v Cromarty [2004] NSWCCA 54, para 85). Once it has been determined that there is no alternative to imprisonment, the Judge must fix the length of the prison term. At that point the Court should consider whether an alternative to full time custody is available and, if available, is appropriate. In the context of that issue, Howie J said this: (para 28) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... But the appropriateness of an alternative to full time custody will depend on a number of factors, one of importance being whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment. The court in choosing an alternative to full time custody cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment:  
        R v Jurisic 
         at 250B."" 
        
       
      
    66 The importance of general deterrence in respect of this class of offence was again emphasised by the Chief Justice in R v Howland (1999) 104 A Crim R 273. That was a case in which a truck driver had deliberately driven through a red light. He collided with a motorcyclist who died as a result of his injuries. The sentencing Judge determined that it was not a case of momentary inattention or misjudgment. He nonetheless imposed a sentence of 18 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. On a Crown appeal the Court quashed the sentence. The offender was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, being a minimum term of 9 months and an additional term of 9 months. Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL and McInerney J agreed) said this: (at 279) 
     
      
       
        
        ""His Honour's exercise of the sentencing discretion erred in two respects: first, by failing to give appropriate weight to the objective seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum penalty; secondly, by failing to give weight to the need for general deterrence -- the deterrence to others from engaging in irresponsible conduct that so often results in death or serious injury. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the first error, the community has indicated that it wishes to denounce this conduct in the strongest terms. The premium on human life which our society accepts as a fundamental value is such that culpable conduct which kills must be treated as a serious crime. By the increases in the maximum sentences, the community, acting through the Parliament, has indicated that this is a crime which it wishes to denounce and deter. It is the duty of the judges to reflect this community concern. 
        
       
       
        
        The second factor is the need to deter others from engaging in the conduct which might lead to the commission of this offence. Judge Job made no express reference to this factor. There is, and has been for many years, a debate as to the deterrence value of imprisonment. Judges will differ in their opinions with respect to this matter. It is perfectly appropriate for sentencing to vary, within reasonable bounds, to reflect such differences of opinion, being differences which judges share with members of the community as a whole. The emphasis, however, is on the reasonable bounds. 
        
       
       
        
        Sentencing has always been based on the acceptance of the proposition that condign punishment of offenders will have a deterrent effect on others. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to have this deterrent effect, sentencing practice of the courts must reflect a consistency in approach. That is what this Court sought to achieve in  
        Jurisic 
        . This is an offence most often committed by young men. Young men in our community must understand that if you drive dangerously and kill someone, you will go to gaol. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, a period of imprisonment was the only appropriate penalty for this offence."" 
        
       
      
    67 The sentencing task in respect of Mr Campton was unquestionably difficult. Mr Campton had been a heroin addict. He had, against all odds, exhibited extraordinary character and abstained from drugs. His rehabilitation, whilst encouraging, was potentially fragile. Her Honour feared, and with some justification, that full time custody may jeopardise his achievement. In these circumstances one can well understand the sentence which was imposed. 
     
      
    68 However, two things must be recognised. First, inconsistency in sentence is ultimately injustice. There is incongruity in the lenient sentence imposed upon Mr Campton compared to harsher sentences imposed upon others whose characters were without blemish. The typical offender under s52A, who is found to exhibit moral culpability, is given a full time custodial sentence even though he has an impeccable character. Yet Mr Campton, who was also morally culpable, and whose character was less that impeccable, escaped a full time custodial sentence because his character provided him with an opportunity to exhibit remarkable self rehabilitation. 
     
      
    69 Secondly, as Howie J said in R v Zamagias (supra: para 65), the sentencing Judge, when determining whether an alternative to full time custody is available, must consider whether that alternative will satisfactorily fulfil the need, which is especially important in respect of this class of offence, to denounce the conduct and to deter others. 
     
      
    70 In my view, the departure from the guidelines, and the resort to periodic detention, cannot be justified. A period of imprisonment was required. I believe, with respect, that error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
       
      Discretion on Crown Appeal. 
       
      
    71 An issue arises whether the Court should intervene to correct the error. When sentenced to periodic detention Mr Campton changed his place of abode. He did so in order to comply with the order of periodic detention made by her Honour. He thereby reduced, if not lost, his prospects of employment as a jockey. I accept that the dislocation arising from the sentence imposed was more significant in this case than in most. 
     
      
    72 It being a Crown appeal, if Mr Campton were resentenced, the term imposed would be at the lower end of the range (Dinsdale; supra: at 341 per Kirby J). Such a sentence would be likely to involve a period of 12 months custody, whether imposed as a fixed term or as a non parole period. The sentence, no doubt, would commence on 3 October 2003 (the commencement date of Mr Campton's existing sentence), recognising the dislocation referred to. In other words, a little over 6 months of the sentence would then remain (cf s5(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). 
     
      
    73 There are, however, two matters which may suggest the Court should not intervene. First, a Crown appeal inevitably involves an element of double jeopardy. The person sentenced is called upon to face sentence for a second time. It is for that reason that the Court always has an overriding discretion to dismiss the appeal, notwithstanding error. 
     
      
    74 Secondly, there has been, for one reason and another, significant delay in this matter. The offence occurred on 6 August 2001. The sentence was imposed on 19 September 2003. The Crown appeal was lodged six weeks later, on 31 October 2003. It was served on 5 November 2003. There is no explanation for the delay in the lodgement of the appeal. Mr Campton in the meantime has attended for periodic detention since 3 October 2003. He has, either of his own volition, or more recently as a consequence of the disqualification imposed by her Honour, not driven since the offence occurred. 
     
      
    75 In all the circumstances, although with some hesitation, I believe it would be unduly harsh to impose at this point a term of full time custody. 
     
      
    76 I therefore propose that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    77 BELL J: I agree with Kirby J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: The matters which would come under consideration on appeal are special to the facts of this case and are unlikely to involve any question of legal principle, or any question in which persons other than the parties have an interest. 
     
      
    2 The cause of the plaintiff’s fall was that there were pieces of loose concrete on the footpath, one of which was sticking up (judgment [3]). The plaintiff tripped and fell on the broken concrete. The plaintiff took a piece of the concrete away, and put photographs of it in evidence (Blue 214). The plaintiff had passed that way as he went to the shop and did not notice that there was anything wrong with the footpath. He had walked that way on other occasions before the day of his injury and had not noticed the broken concrete (judgment [5]). 
     
      
    3 The trial judge found that a repair effected by the defendant in 1998 was inadequate, because a concrete fillet used to cover a variation in level between two slabs in the footpath was not successfully bonded. However, she held that the defendant was not shown to be in breach of a duty of care, because it was not shown that the defendant should have been aware that the concrete fillet had become detached and broken up. 
     
      
    4 The main point sought to be agitated on an appeal is to the effect that her Honour did not address the question whether the defendant was in breach of a duty of care by reason of the defective repair job in 1998, because it was then foreseeable that the concrete fillet would become detached and break up, causing a tripping hazard. 
     
      
    5 In our opinion, although her Honour did not explicitly address that question, it is implicit in her decision that the use of a method of repair which was not satisfactory as a permanent solution did not amount to a breach of duty, where it was associated with an appropriate program of inspections, ongoing repairs and progressive application of more permanent solutions to such problems. 
     
      
    6 Accordingly, we do not think there is such doubt concerning the decision as would justify the grant of leave to appeal. 
     
      
    7 Although the findings on damages were not carried to completion, they went far enough to show that the plaintiff is very unlikely to recover any significant amount of damages, as most of his complaints were closely related to injuries which had been earlier compensated in other litigation. 
     
      
    8 Accordingly, we order that leave to appeal be refused with costs.

    2 Simpson J: I agree with Sperling J. 
     
      
    3 Sperling J: 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    4 A prosecution is pending in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales against the present applicant, Rick Moy. The prosecutor is Warringah Council. The applicant is charged with two offences, being offences constituted respectively by s109F and s109ZH of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. (I will come to those sections later in this judgment.) 
     
      
    5 The application in this court is for leave to appeal against a decision by Bignold J, a judge of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales, given on 22 August 2003, refusing an application for a permanent stay of the prosecution on the ground of abuse of process. Leave is sought pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    6 The gist of the application for a stay was that conviction for the offences charged would be inconsistent with an earlier determination by Commissioner J S Murrell, a commissioner of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales, given on 22 August 2002 in proceedings in which McIntosh Properties Pty Limited was the applicant and Warringah Council was respondent. 
     
      
    7 The parties in the prosecution and the earlier proceedings are, accordingly, not the same, the prosecution being brought by Warringah Council against the present applicant and the earlier proceedings having been between another party and the Council. In these circumstances, the applicant relied on the extended doctrine of res judicata which I will discuss later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Extension of time 
       
      
    8 The notice of appeal was filed within 28 days of the decision instead of within 14 days as required. Application for extension of time is made on the ground that the applicant’s solicitor was overseas and that the applicant incorrectly understood that the time limit was 28 days. The time should be extended. 
     
      
       
      The legislation 
       
      
    9 The relevant legislation consists of the Environmental Planning & Assessment Act 1979 (the Act) and the Environmental Planning & Assessment Regulation 2000 (the Regulation). In this judgment, references to sections of the Act are prefaced by “s”. References to clauses in the Regulation are prefaced by “cl”. 
     
      
    10 Where a development consent is required, such consent may be granted by a consent authority, in which case building work may not be carried out otherwise than in accordance with the development consent (s76A(1)). The relevant municipal council is a consent authority (in this case Warringah Council). 
     
      
    11 The consent authority may, on application, modify a development consent if it is satisfied that the development as modified is ”substantially the same development as the development for which consent was originally granted and before that consent as originally granted was modified” (s96(2)-(4)). Such satisfaction is a threshold question. If answered affirmatively, there is then the merit of the application to be decided. An appeal lies to the Land and Environment Court (s96(6)). 
     
      
    12 Building may not commence pursuant to a development consent until a construction certificate has been issued; a construction certificate may be issued by an accredited certifier (s81A(2)). An accredited certifier is a certifying authority, authorised to issue such a certificate (s109D(1)). (The present applicant was an accredited certifier and certifying authority.) 
     
      
    13 A construction certificate must not be issued unless the certifying authority is satisfied that the requirements of regulations made under the Act have been complied with (s109F(1)(a)).  
     
      
    14 The Regulation provides that a certifying authority must not issue a construction certificate for building work “unless it [which includes “he” or “she”] is satisfied … that the design and construction of the building (as depicted in … plans and specifications …) are not inconsistent with the development consent” (cl145(1)). 
     
      
    15 A person who makes a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular in a construction certificate is guilty of an offence (s109ZH(1)(b)).  
     
      
       
      Further background 
       
      
    16 In the present case, Warringah Council granted a development consent. Thereafter, the applicant issued a construction certificate as an accredited certifier. Subsequently, in the proceedings to which I have referred, Commissioner Murrell modified the original development consent on the merits, having held on the threshold question that the development consent as modified would be “substantially the same development” as that for which consent had been granted.  
     
      
    17 The prosecution was then instituted against the applicant. The gist of the prosecution is that the construction certificate was issued by the applicant in breach of s109F(1)(a) and cl 145(1)(a), in that the applicant was not satisfied that the construction certificate was “not inconsistent with the development consent”; and that the construction certificate contained a false statement to the effect that the applicant was so satisfied. 
     
      
    18 Then came the unsuccessful application to Bignold J for a permanent stay of the prosecution, which is now the subject of the present application for leave to appeal. 
     
      
       
      Decision by Commissioner Murrell 22 August 2002 
       
      
    19 As recorded by the Commissioner, work had commenced on the development. As approved by the development consent and as partly constructed, the development consisted of a basement parking level and two residential levels above. The exterior walls, internal stairs and concrete slabs for the three levels of the building had been constructed.  
     
      
    20 The building, as partly constructed, did not accord with the development consent in the following respects at least: the level of the basement was not below natural ground level at the front of the building, the front setback of the building was less than approved, and the basement floor level was 1.5m higher than that approved. 
     
      
    21 The developer had applied to the Council for modification of the development consent by increasing the height of the approved development by 1.5m and allowing the shorter setback. This was refused. At that stage, unless there were a successful appeal, the structure would have had to be demolished. 
     
      
    22 It appears that, on appeal, a more sophisticated modification was proposed. With reduced thickness of the slabs and of ceiling heights (presumably already incorporated in the existing structure) and a modified roof, the overall maximum height of the structure was not breached. A variation in the front setback was still required. There were other proposed modifications which appear to be of less significance.  
     
      
    23 In her judgment, the Commissioner reviewed the relevant planning controls and guidelines, the evidence (including expert evidence) and the submissions. 
     
      
    24 As to the threshold question, namely, whether the proposed development was substantially the same as the development approved in the development consent, the Commissioner held that it was. She said, at [47] to [49] of the judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        [I]n this case I am satisfied that the development as proposed to be modified is substantially the same development to that approved by the Council … In this regard I agree with the applicant’s submission that the development as approved will read as a two storey residential flat building above basement parking and that the proposed modification will result in a similar building. It will also read as two floors of residential above parking containing 16 units with a similar footprint and landscaped area. 
        
       
       
        
        In my assessment the application will not radically transform the development as approved or change its character and it will remain essentially the same as the development approved by Council. This is a residential flat building of similar height, size, bulk and scale with two levels of residential above parking. 
        
       
       
        
        … In my assessment while there are numerous changes proposed in terms of internal configuration, the roofline setback, etc, I am satisfied that the essential character of the building will not be changed by the modifications proposed whether that be in the plans submitted to the Council of the amended plans prepared to comply with Mr Robinson’s comments. It is not simply a matter of the number of changes which is relevant and I am satisfied that in isolation and in combination the proposed development will remain essentially, materially and substantially the same. 
        
       
      
    25 Having determined the threshold question in favour of the developer, the Commissioner proceeded to decide whether the modification should be permitted on its merits (see [50]). In that regard, it appears that the Commissioner accepted the Council’s submission that the top floor of the development should be set back from the front alignment of the building (see [61] of the judgment). The proposed modifications were approved with that additional requirement. 
     
      
    26 In the foregoing review, I have not captured all of the modifications referred to in the judgment, but I believe I have captured the main points of what was decided.  
     
      
    27 In the result, the appeal was upheld by Commissioner Murrell and an order was made approving modification to the original development consent, subject to conditions, all as specified in an annexure to the judgment (see [66]).  
     
      
       
      The prosecution – further detail 
       
      
    28 The first summons charges that the applicant issued a construction certificate in breach of s109F(1)(a) and cl 145(1)(a) “in that in the circumstances in which the construction certificate was issued a certifying authority could not be satisfied that the design and construction of the building as depicted in the plans and specifications for the construction certificate were not inconsistent with the development consent”.  
     
      
    29 Particulars of the offence under s125(1) specify inconsistencies between the construction certificate and the development consent, including the following: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The carparking on the development consent is below ground whereas the carparking for the construction certificate plans is above ground. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The heights and levels of the building approved by the construction certificate have been increased compared to the development consent. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) The southern front setback to Old Pittwater Road and the side eastern and western setbacks have been reduced between the development consent and the construction certificate. 
        
       
       
      These are the major modifications approved by Commissioner Murrell. 
       
      
    30 The second summons charges that the applicant made a false statement in breach of s109ZH. The representation in the certificate which is relied upon is in the following terms in the particulars incorporated in the summons: 
     
      
       
        
        I certify that the work if completed in accordance with these plans and specifications will comply with the requirements of s81A(5) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. 
        
       
       
      Impliedly, that is asserted to be a statement of compliance with cl 145(1)(a). The statement is then said to be false and misleading in view of the same inconsistencies as are specified in the first summons. 
       
       
      The decision by Bignold J 22 August 2003 
       
      
    31 In his judgment given on 22 August 2003, Bignold J noted, at [33], the following agreed fact: 
     
      
       
        
        [T]hat the plans accompanying the modification application (ultimately approved by Commissioner Murrell) include the changes made to the originally approved development by the plans approved by the Defendant when he issued the construction certificate. 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to say, at [35]: 
       
       
        
        Accordingly it can be accurately said that his 
         [the present applicant’s] 
         application is founded upon the fact that whatever be the differences to the approved development that were created by the construction certificate issued by the Defendant those differences were included in, and encompassed by, the modifications to the development consent subsequently approved by the Court’s earlier judgment. 
        
       
      
    32 Having reviewed the authorities to which he had been referred, Bignold J said at [57]: 
     
      
       
        
        The requirement that the  
        same question or issue 
         be raised in the subsequent proceedings as that which has been conclusively determined in the earlier proceedings is a prerequisite that is common to the doctrines of issue estoppel and res judicata in its ordinary and extended application (including in the latter case the doctrine of abuse of process). 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour’s reasons for refusing the application were then as follows, at [58-60]: 
     
      
       
        
        [T]he Defendant has failed to establish that the issues raised by the two prosecutions of offences under the  
        EP&A Act 
         brought against him are the same issue or question that was determined in the Court’s earlier judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        The most obvious reason for so concluding does not depend upon the rejection of the Defendant’s principal submission that the expression “not inconsistent with the development consent” appearing in cl 145(1)(a) of the Regulation (which is central to both charges) when referring to the construction certificate plans may be legitimately interpreted as meaning “substantially the same as (the development) for which the development consent was originally granted” which is the statutory expression employed by s96(2)(a) of the  
        EP&A Act  
        (which was central to the Court’s earlier judgment). The reason why the issues or questions raised by the current proceedings are clearly not the same as the issue determined by the earlier judgment is simply that the issues raised by the prosecutions concern the relevant “satisfaction” of the Defendant in his capacity as the relevant certifying authority (in issuing the construction certificate) as to whether the construction certificate plans were not inconsistent with the development consent whereas the earlier judgment concerned the relevant “satisfaction” by a different person, namely a Commissioner of this Court in determining an appeal pursuant to s96(6) of the EP&A Act against the decision of the Council (as the consent authority) in respect of a modification application made by another different person. 
        
       
       
        
        In other words the question whether  
        person X 
         is satisfied of a state of affairs is not the  
        same 
         question as whether  
        person Y  
        is also satisfied when persons X and Y are entirely independent of one another and are acting in different capacities from one another. 
        
       
      
    34 At [41], his Honour had noted the applicant’s argument that the terminology in cl 145 – “not inconsistent with the development consent” – was co-extensive in meaning with the terminology in s96 – “substantially the same development as the development for which consent was originally granted”. His Honour did not resolve that question of statutory construction. He thought it best to avoid doing so on an interlocutory application (see [63]). 
     
      
    35 Accordingly, the ratio of his Honour’s decision was as follows:– The doctrine of extended estoppel required that the issue be the same; and it was not the same because – assuming the terminology in cl 145 and in s96 had the same meaning – the question decided by Commissioner Murrell was whether there was in the Commissioner’s opinion the necessary degree of similarity between the proposed modification and the original development consent, whereas the question in the prosecution was whether the applicant was satisfied of that degree of similarity between the development as certified and the original development consent. 
     
      
    36 It was for these reasons that Bignold J dismissed the application. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    37 The grounds relied on for leave to appeal and in the appeal, if leave is granted, are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in holding that for an abuse of process to apply the issues in the current proceedings and the earlier proceedings “must be the very same” [42], [57]. 
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in holding that the reason why the issues were not the “very same” was because: 
         
         
          
          (a) the issues raised by the Prosecutor concern the relevant satisfaction of the Appellant in his capacity as the certifying authority, whereas the earlier judgment concerns the relevant satisfaction of a different person, namely the Commissioner of the Court; and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) “the question of whether  
          person x 
           is satisfied of a state of affairs is not the  
          same 
           question as to whether  
          person y 
           is also satisfied when person X and Y are entirely independent of one another and are acting in different capacities from one another” [59] – [61]. 
          
         
         
        3. His Honour should have held, irrespective of whether person X or Y is satisfied, that: 
         
         
          
          (a) if the current prosecution results in a judgment that controverts or is inconsistent with an earlier judgment, such that it creates a conflict between the two decisions; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the current prosecution results in a scandal of conflicting judgments based on substantially the same or related facts; and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the current prosecution and the earlier judgment of Commissioner Murrell resonated with a similarity that both conceptually, and in application, they were consonant one with the other, so that 
          
         
         
          
          it would be an abuse of process to allow the current prosecution to proceed to final judgment. 
          
         
         
        4. Leave ought to be granted for the following reasons: 
         
         
          
          (a) if the Appellant is successful on the Appeal the substantive proceedings pending before the Land and Environment Court may not need to be determined; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) this will result in substantial savings in time and costs for both the parties and the Court; 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the question of law as to whether Bignold J applied the appropriate test in determining whether there was an abuse of process (as distinct from the tests applicable for issue estoppel and res judicata) is an important question of law. 
          
         
        
       
       
      Holding 
       
      
    38 In my opinion, Bignold J did not err in dismissing the application for the reasons he gave and for other reasons as well. 
     
      
       
      Do the questions have to be the same? 
       
      
    39 Bignold J held that they did. He was right. 
     
      
    40 What has been called the extended doctrine of res judicata is introduced in Spencer Bower, Turner & Handley, The doctrine of res judicata (3rd ed, London, Butterworths, 1996) in the following way (at paragraph 443): 
     
      
       
        
        Defences of res judicata are available where the cause of action sued upon has previously been litigated to judgment. Defences of issue estoppel are also available where an issue of fact or law which has been decided is raised again in later proceedings between the same parties, but only in respect of determinations of ultimate issues fundamental to the earlier decision and subject to the special circumstances exception. Issue estoppels cover determinations on issues in the proceedings which it can be inferred were actually decided, and other questions which were fundamental to the earlier decision although they were not, for whatever reason, in contention in those proceedings. Beyond that there is also an extended doctrine of res judicata based on abuse of process which can apply where defences of merger, cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel are not strictly available. 
        
       
      
    41 The extended doctrine has spawned more than one line of authority. For example, it applies where a litigant has failed to raise a matter in earlier proceedings which could have been raised and is, for that reason, precluded from doing so in later proceedings: Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (1981) 147 CLR 589. That kind of abuse of process does not arise in the present case. 
     
      
    42 The species of abuse of process invoked by the applicant in the present case finds its source in the decision of the House of Lords in Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App Cas 665. In what follows in this judgment, I will refer to that species of abuse of process as the extended doctrine of res judicata. No other species of abuse of process is involved. 
     
      
    43 The appellant in Reichel brought an action against (inter alia) his bishop claiming a declaration that he was vicar of a benefice and that an instrument of resignation executed by him was void. It was found that the vicarage was void (vacant, we would say) by reason of the appellant’s resignation with the bishop’s consent, and the declaration was accordingly refused. In later proceedings, the respondent, having been appointed to the benefice as the appellant’s successor, claimed a declaration that he was vicar and an injunction to restrain the appellant from interfering with his use and occupation of the house and lands the subject of the benefice. In his defence, the appellant set up the same case as that on which he had been defeated in the earlier proceedings. The Privy Council affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal that the defence should be struck out as an abuse of process. The decision of the court was unanimous. Reasons were given by Lord Halsbury LC (at 668): 
     
      
       
        
        My Lords, I think it would be a scandal to the administration of justice if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be permitted by changing the form of the proceedings to set up the same case again. It cannot be denied that the only ground upon which Mr Reichel can resist the claim by Mr Magrath to occupy the vicarage is that he (Mr Reichel) is still vicar of Sparsholt. If by the hypothesis he is not vicar of Sparsholt and his appeal absolutely fails, it surely must be in the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to prevent the defeated litigant raising the very same question which the Court has decided in a separate action.  
        
       
       
        
        I believe there must be an inherent jurisdiction in every Court of Justice to prevent such an abuse of its procedure and I therefore think that this appeal must likewise be dismissed. 
        
       
       
      And by Lord Watson (at 668): 
       
       
        
        My Lords, this is an attempt by the appellant to retain the temporalities of the benefice of Sparsholt by re-trying, with his successor in the benefice, the same issues which have already been conclusively decided against him in a question with his proper contradictor. The Court must, in my opinion, have jurisdiction to forbid any such abuse of its process. 
        
       
      
    44 The foundational elements of this decision were that a party who had failed on a question or issue in earlier proceedings was precluded from re-litigating the same question or issue in later proceedings, albeit that the other party in the later proceedings was different. The effect was to extend res judicata or issue estoppel principles to proceedings involving a different party. 
     
      
    45 It is integral to res judicata and issue estoppel that the question in the second proceedings is the same as that decided in the first. Of the many judicial pronouncements to that effect, I provide one. In Turner v London Transport Executive [1977] ICR 952, a decision of the English Court of Appeal, Browne LJ said (at 964): 
     
      
       
        
        The essential foundation of a plea of issue estoppel must be that the issue or issues raised in the first proceedings, and the issue or issues raised in the second proceedings are identical. It is for the party who seeks to rely on the estoppel to establish this identity. 
        
       
       
      This is of the essence of such estoppel. It is because the same question has been decided that it may not be re-litigated.  
       
      
    46 There is no reason why that should not also be the case where the extended doctrine of estoppel is invoked, albeit that another party is involved. Why in reason should there be a more favourable rule where another party is involved than where the proceedings are between the same parties?  
     
      
    47 The fact that it may be difficult in some cases to decide whether the question is the same, does not derogate from the requirement: see for example Blair v Curran (1939) 62 CLR 464, where a great deal of the judgment is occupied by exploring whether the question previously determined was truly the same. 
     
      
    48 Not surprisingly, counsel for the applicant in the present proceedings had been unable to find any decision in which the extended doctrine of res judicata has been applied without the question being identical. 
     
      
    49 There are then two further decisions of the High Court to review. The first is Rogers (1994) 181 CLR 251. In that case, in the course of a criminal trial, the trial judge rejected records of interview on the ground that they were not made voluntarily. At a subsequent trial relating to other charges, the prosecution sought to rely on two of the records of interview in support of certain of the new charges. The majority, constituted by Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ, held that the doctrine of issue estoppel as it has developed in civil proceedings is not applicable to criminal proceedings, but that the tender of the records of interview, was, in the circumstances, an abuse of process. Mason CJ said (at 256-7): 
     
      
       
        
        Re-litigation in subsequent criminal proceedings of an issue already finally decided in earlier criminal proceedings is not only inconsistent with the principle that a judicial determination is binding, final and conclusive (subject to fraud and fresh evidence), but is also calculated to erode public confidence in the administration of justice by generating conflicting decisions  
        on the same issue 
        . These considerations necessarily prevail over any competing public interest in the securing of convictions against the appellant.  
        [Emphasis added.] 
        
       
       
      Deane and Gaudron JJ said in their joint judgment (at 280): 
       
       
        
        Strictly, the 1989 ruling on voluntariness was concerned only with those parts of the records of interview relevant to the offences for which the appellant then stood trial. However and as already indicated, the statements which the prosecution wishes to tender in the appellant’s forthcoming trial are, so far as voluntariness is concerned,  
        exactly the same 
         as those tendered in the 1989 proceedings. In the circumstances, tender of the records of interview constitutes a direct challenge to the 1989 determination which was a final determination, or became so, once verdicts were returned. The challenge is one which invites “the scandal of conflicting decisions” (Spencer Bower and Turner, p 411).  
        [Emphasis added.] 
        
       
      
    50 Nothing in this case suggests that the extended doctrine of res judicata operates on anything less than the same question. 
     
      
    51 The decision of the High Court in Carroll (2002) 77 ALJR 157 is relied upon by the applicant as permitting a permanent stay of proceedings to be granted on the ground of inconsistency, as distinct from complete identity between the question decided in the earlier proceedings and the question at issue in the later proceedings. Whatever may be the effect of the decision in relation to successive criminal proceedings, I do not read the case as having any relevance to the content and operation of the extended doctrine of res judicata where the prior proceedings are civil rather than criminal. In particular, I do not read the case as authority for the proposition that where the earlier proceedings are civil proceedings complete identity is unnecessary. 
     
      
    52 In Carroll, the respondent was charged with murder. He gave evidence under oath at his trial that he did not kill the deceased. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. A verdict of acquittal was entered on appeal. In subsequent proceedings, the respondent was indicted for perjury in relation to his sworn evidence at the trial that he did not kill the deceased. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The Court of Criminal Appeal of Queensland concluded that the trial should have been stayed as an abuse of process and quashed the conviction for perjury. The High Court upheld that decision.  
     
      
    53 One sees immediately the entry point of the applicant’s argument. The respondent’s evidence at the trial was that he did not kill the deceased. The question at the subsequent perjury trial was whether he did. That was not the same question as was decided at the earlier murder trial without further analysis because, in theory at least, the jury at the earlier trial might have had a reasonable doubt about the mental element of the offence and not about the act of killing. 
     
      
    54 I do not propose to provide a full review of the decision. The judgments are lengthy and cover a variety of considerations. True it is that passages may be cited which put the decision on inconsistency rather than identity as between the relevant questions. And true it is that Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, at [41] and [42], saw the questions as different, albeit immaterially so. On the other hand, Gaudron and Gummow JJ, at [101], and McHugh J at [127] regarded the question at the murder trial as having been, on analysis, whether the respondent had killed the deceased and, accordingly, in their opinion, it was the same question as arose at the perjury trial.  
     
      
    55 The reason a detailed review of the decision is unnecessary is the importance given in all of the judgments to the prior proceedings having been criminal proceedings, and criminal proceedings resulting in an acquittal. The judgments are redolent with considerations applicable only to such a case, including the importance of finality in criminal proceedings and the incontrovertibility of a verdict of acquittal.  
     
      
    56 It is sufficient to deal with this decision in another way. Decisions are to be received as determinations relative to the facts of the case: Quinn v Leathem [1901] AC 495, 506. There is nothing in Carroll to suggest that any member of the court intended to lay down as a principle that something less than precise identity is sufficient for application of the extended doctrine of res judicata in relation to both criminal and civil proceedings. There is everything to suggest that the court intended to lay down principles in relation to successive criminal proceedings exclusively. 
     
      
    57 Secondly, the implications of the applicant’s reading of Carroll have to be considered. If, in relation to civil proceedings, the extended doctrine of res judicata does not require complete identity of questions, two alternative implications arise. One is that there is a more liberal test in civil cases which do not involve the same parties than in cases which do. That would be absurd and cannot be the law. The other is that the rule in relation to res judicata and issue estoppel in civil cases can always be circumvented by recourse to the extended doctrine. The court in Carroll cannot be taken to have made such a radical change in the law without making it clear that that is what it was doing. The necessary conclusion is that (at least in relation to civil proceedings) the extended doctrine of res judicata requires identity of questions in the same way as res judicata and issue estoppel require identity of questions. 
     
      
       
      Are the questions the same? 
       
      
    58 They are not, for the reasons given by Bignold J and for other reasons.  
     
      
       
      First reason 
       
      
    59 I will deal first with Bignold J’s approach. 
     
      
    60 I will assume for the immediate purpose that the phrases “not inconsistent with” and “substantially the same development” have the same meaning, imputing the same nature and degree of allowable variance relative to the development consent. 
     
      
    61 I will also assume, for the immediate purpose, that there is no material difference between the variations in the case of the modified development (relative to the development consent) and the variations in the case of the construction certificate (relative to the development consent). (There is the concession that the variations in the case of the approved development exceeded those in the case of the construction certificate, which is not a material difference for immediate purposes.) 
     
      
    62 There is nonetheless a significant difference between the two provisions. Section 96 calls for the opinion of a tribunal (the consent authority or the court on appeal) as to whether, in nature and degree, the variation is allowable. By contrast, cl 145 calls for a finding of fact by a tribunal (the court) as to whether another person (the certifying authority; in this case, the applicant) was satisfied that the variation, in nature and degree, was allowable. In one case it is a tribunal’s own opinion that counts. In the other, it is a tribunal’s finding of fact as to the opinion of the certifier that counts. 
     
      
    63 There is a fundamental difference in this respect between the question arising under s96 and the question arising under cl 145. It is a difference which exists independently of any difference in the nature, degree or content of the variations which present for consideration under the respective provisions. For this reason alone, the questions are not the same.  
     
      
    64 Bignold J did not put the point quite that way, but, in substance, it is what he said at [58 – 60] of the judgment. 
     
      
       
        
        Second reason 
        
       
      
    65 A second reason for the question being different arises from yet a further difference between the two provisions. 
     
      
    66 Section 96 involves a comparison between a proposed development and the development consent. Clause 145 involves a comparison between a construction certificate and the development consent. The questions arising under the respective provisions are different in that respect.  
     
      
    67 The applicant invokes the concession that, on the facts of this case, the variations approved pursuant to s96 were more extensive than the variations in the construction certificate relative to the development consent. That, the applicant says, is not a material difference but, on the contrary, demonstrates that an adverse finding in the prosecution, grounded as it is on cl 145, would be inconsistent with the prior approval of a modified development by Commissioner Murrell pursuant to s96. 
     
      
    68 This is recourse to the facts of the case to show that, as a matter of reasoning, there is no inconsistency between questions which, on their face, are different. Such recourse to the facts is impermissible under the principles relating to estoppel by res judicata and issue estoppel. By parity of reasoning it is impermissible under the principles applicable to the extended doctrine of res judicata. 
     
      
    69 In this regard, I need only cite the decision of the High Court in O’Donel v The Commissioner for Road Transport & Tramways (NSW) (1938) 59 CLR 744. The appellant, O’Donel, brought two proceedings for compensation for incapacity due to blindness allegedly resulting from injury received on 19 March 1933 in the course of his employment with the respondent. In proceedings in the Supreme Court of NSW, pursuant to s124 of the Transport Act 1930, the appellant recovered the salary he was receiving at the time of the injury for the period from 14 September 1934 to 15 February 1935. In the second proceeding, brought in the Workers Compensation Commission of NSW, the appellant claimed workers’ compensation from 15 February 1935 for incapacity due to blindness resulting from the same injury. The Commission dismissed the claim, being satisfied that the appellant’s blindness resulted from a progressive, chronic disease from which the appellant was suffering before 19 March 1933 and thereafter, rather than from the injury received on 19 March 1933. The Commission held, accordingly, that the injury received on 19 March 1933 did not cause any incapacity for work after 15 February 1935 and dismissed the claim. 
     
      
    70 On appeal from the decision of the Commission, it was argued that the Commission was constrained by the doctrine of res judicata to disallow evidence adduced by the respondent that the appellant’s blindness in the period after 15 February 1935 resulted from disease rather than from injury received on 19 March 1933. 
     
      
    71 It was held by the High Court that there was no estoppel. The earlier proceedings had determined only that the appellant’s blindness up to 15 February 1935 was caused by the injury received on 19 March 1933. Was it not then the same blindness which continued thereafter? Latham CJ said, at 758: 
     
      
       
        
        When the matter came at a later date before the Workers' Compensation Commission the continued existence of total blindness was proved. It is an easy inference to conclude that the blindness existing at the later date had the same cause as the blindness which existed at the earlier date. It is, as it appears to me, at this point that the real difficulty of the case appears. How far can an estoppel be extended by inference? 
        
       
      
    72 His Honour held it could not. He said, at 758-9: 
     
      
       
        
        Now it cannot possibly be said that the Supreme Court, by a judgment relating only to a period which ended on 15th February, thereby made any direct or actual decision or determination as to any matter or state of affairs whatever which existed at a later date. That judgment did create an estoppel as to one proposition — but that estoppel cannot operate to establish by estoppel another proposition which follows from the former proposition only when that proposition is combined with others the establishment of which depends upon evidence or assumption. 
        
       
      
    73 That the plaintiff’s blindness before and after 15 February 1935 had the same cause depended on evidence. His Honour concluded, at 759: 
     
      
       
        
        The question which it decided is, as the Full Court of the Supreme Court said, not eadem quaestio. In my opinion the plaintiff's contention therefore fails. 
        
       
      
    74 Evatt and McTiernan JJ were of the same opinion for substantially the same reasons. 
     
      
    75 The doctrine of extended res judicata is designed to bring the principles of estoppel by res judicata and issue estoppel into operation notwithstanding that there is a difference in the parties. The reasoning in O’Donel applies. It follows that the patent difference between the questions arising under the two provisions cannot be cured by recourse to the factual relationship between the matter decided by Commissioner Murrell and the matter to be decided in the prosecution. 
     
      
       
        
        Third reason 
        
       
      
    76 A third reason for the questions not being the same relates to the function of the respective provisions and the construction to be given to them having regard to that function. 
     
      
    77 The applicant submits that the phrases “substantially the same development” and “not inconsistent with” have the same ordinary meanings. That may be so in ordinary usage. However, the fact that the regulation-making authority has chosen different language in cl 145 from that used by the Parliament in s96, where the two provisions are part of the same code, strongly suggests that a distinction was intended. More particularly, both terminologies call for a judgment which cannot be made in vacuo and which necessarily takes into account the function of the respective provisions.  
     
      
    78 From this perspective, the formulae “substantially the same development” in s96 and “not inconsistent with” in cl 145 cannot be seen as having the same import. Put another way, it is entirely possible that the same variation (or a more extensive variation, as in this case) might be seen as resulting in “substantially the same development” within the meaning of s96, and yet as being incapable of accommodating the requirement that the certified development be “not inconsistent with” the development consent within the meaning of cl 145. 
     
      
    79 That is because s96 and cl 145 have different functions in the scheme of the legislation. The function of cl 145 is to ensure that the development as built will be in accordance with the development consent. The function of s96 is to allow modification of the development consent (albeit with a threshold limitation). In this context, the kind of variation contemplated by s96 and by cl 145 may be quite different in character. Variations which infringe the limitations on development expressly or impliedly imposed by the development consent may be seen as “inconsistent with” the development consent within the meaning of cl 145. On the other hand, s96 may be seen as contemplating relief from strict compliance with such limitations under the formula “substantially the same development”.  
     
      
    80 There is also, the degree of variation which the respective provisions will accommodate. Clause 145 is proscriptive. It prohibits the issue of a construction certificate unless the certifier is satisfied of the matter specified. Section 96, on the other hand, is a facultative, beneficial provision. As such it is to be construed and applied in a way that is favourable to those who are to benefit from the provision: Re Kearney; Ex parte Jurlama (1984) 52 ALR 24, 28; Zangzinchai v Millanta (1994) 125 ALR 265, 272. 
     
      
    81 It is unnecessary to decide whether cl 145 is to be applied strictly although that argument is available. It is sufficient that s96 is to be construed liberally on grounds which do not apply to cl 145. It follows that s96 may accommodate a greater degree of variation in the proposed development referrable to the development consent than cl 145 will accommodate. 
     
      
    82 For that reason also, the finding that the approved development was “substantially the same development” within the meaning of s96 does not necessarily imply that the plans the subject of the construction certificate were “not inconsistent with” the development consent within the meaning of cl 145. And that is so notwithstanding that the approved development involved more extensive variations than were involved in the construction certificate. 
     
      
    83 Because of disparity in the nature and in the degree of variation which may be accommodated by the respective provisions, the questions arising under the two provisions are not necessarily the same. 
     
      
       
      Judgment in rem 
       
      
    84 The applicant says that the decision by Commissioner Murrell is a judgment in rem. The only relevant consequence would be that the difference in parties does not matter. The principles relating to estoppel by res judicata and issue estoppel would then apply rather than those relating to the extended doctrine. The question decided by Commissioner Murrell would still have to be the same as the question arising in the prosecution. This point cannot avail the applicant. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    85 Bignold J did not err in refusing the application for a permanent stay of the prosecution. I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Proposed orders 
       
      
    86 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Time for application for leave to appeal extended to 18 September 2003. 
       
       
      (2) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (3) Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Keri Damon Mako against the sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Cooper in the District Court at Gosford on 27 March 2003 following his plea of guilty to one count of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 35(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 which offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. The sentence was backdated to 5 November 2002; to take account of pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    2 The facts were that on the evening of 4 November 2002, the applicant attended a party at Kincumber with his brother, Paul Mako, and his brother’s girlfriend, Sonja Lewin, where the applicant and his brother consumed a considerable amount of alcohol and smoked marijuana. The three of them left the party at approximately 1:00am the following morning intending to return to the Mako home in Umina.  
     
      
    3 On the way, an argument developed between the applicant and his brother, who was driving, and at one stage, they got out of the car and had a fight. They then resumed their journey, the argument resumed, the brother driving the car, Ms Lewin in the front passenger seat and the applicant sitting behind her.  
     
      
    4 As the argument continued, the applicant picked up a pair of scissors that were on the back seat of the car, put them in front of Ms Lewin’s neck and cut her throat, causing a laceration some 10 centimetres long which required 10 sutures. Although he initially decamped from the scene, the applicant was shortly afterwards arrested, and when interviewed he made full admissions. He stated that he cut the victim’s throat as he was angry with his brother for not taking him home.  
     
      
    5 The applicant was born on 12 April 1977 and was 25 years old at the date of sentence. He was born in New Zealand, one of a family of three boys. His mother separated from his father when he was 8 years old, and shortly afterwards the family came to Australia where his mother subsequently re-married. He had close relationships with his immediate family, his new stepfather and his extended family, and his Honour found that it was a very loving, close and supportive family, and that they were all fine people. 
     
      
    6 He left school at 17 years, having twice attempted to complete Year 9. He commenced using alcohol at age 15 and shortly thereafter commenced using marijuana quite heavily. Prior to the commission of the offence, the applicant had been in a de facto relationship for some 3 years of which union there was a son, 2 years old at the time of sentencing. The relationship had broken down in difficult circumstance, in that his girlfriend left him and subsequently entered into a relationship with a close friend of the applicant, but he continued to see his son and was responsible on his overnight access visits. Prior to the offence, he had been in steady employment as a storeman and a reference from his employer attested to his reliability and conscientiousness.  
     
      
    7 The applicant had prior convictions for break enter and steal, supply cannabis, resist officer in execution of duty, use offensive language in/or near a public place, larceny, 2 convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and 2 convictions for common assault. He had previously received sentences of periodic detention and community service orders, both of which he had failed to complete as a result of which he had served some short periods of imprisonment and he had received a suspended sentence of 4 months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  
     
      
    8 After his arrest for this offence, the applicant was refused bail and so had spent more than 4 months in prison by the time he appeared for sentence. During that time, he had apparently accepted that in reality, he had a drug and alcohol problem, and had been assessed as having the necessary motivation to undertake the Salvation Army Bridge Programme and a place in that program had been offered to him.  
     
      
    9 The applicant gave evidence that all his contact with the criminal justice system had been related to his use of alcohol and, although he had not previously sought specific help for his problem, he now realised that he needed to deal with his drug and alcohol problems in order to make a proper life for his son. Accordingly, he had been seeing a drug and alcohol counsellor at Long Bay and had attended a number of sessions of the stress management course.  
     
      
    10 In giving evidence the applicant acknowledged responsibility for what he had done and expressed his remorse. He had also written a letter of apology to the victim who had been visiting him in prison and had also written a letter to the Court supporting his admission to the Salvation Army Bridge Programme.  
     
      
    11 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour referred to the plea of guilty and noted that such plea demonstrated remorse and contrition, that he was accordingly entitled to a discount from what would otherwise be an appropriate penalty, and noted that he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. His Honour then had regard to ss 3A and 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and found that there was a chance that at the age of 25 years, given the opportunity and the inducement, he could overcome his drug and alcohol abuse and thereby facilitate his rehabilitation, and that this constituted “special circumstances”, as that term was used in s 44 of the Act. 12 His Honour then sentenced the applicant to imprisonment and set a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of the term of 1 year making a total of 3 years imprisonment, and made consequential orders for his release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    13 The first ground of appeal relied on was that his Honour failed to comply with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in that he failed to firstly set the full term of the sentence, and secondly to set a non-parole period.  
     
      
    14 Section 44 as it stood prior to the amendments effected by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 and in the form which applied in respect of offences committed before 1 February 2003 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a court is required: 
         
          
          (a) Firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
           
          (b) Secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
          
         
         
        (2) The non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record for its reasons for that decision. 
        
       
      
    15 In respect of offences committed on or after 1 February 2003, the Act now provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
         
         
        (2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision). 
        
       
      
    16 It follows that his Honour used the terminology appropriate for offences committed after 1 February 2003, in respect of an offence committed prior to that date and should have first fixed the total sentence followed by a non-parole period. It is apparent that his Honour clearly intended to impose a head sentence of 3 years, but having found special circumstances, intended to fix a non-parole period of 2 years instead of the 2 years and 3 months which would otherwise have been required by s 44(2).  
     
      
    17 However, I can see no difference between a head sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years with a further term of one year however expressed; both amount to the same period of time in custody and the same period of time on parole.  
     
      
    18 In R v Hansen [2002] NSWCCA 321, a similar problem arose where the learned Sentencing Judge had erred in fixing the non-parole period first, followed by the “parole period” contrary to the Act as it stood at the date of sentencing, following the replacement 3 days earlier of the Sentencing Act 1989 by the current Act. This Court held at [21] it had power to re-adjust the sentence pursuant to s 43 of the Act and/or pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to rectify any errors in the manner in which the sentences were expressed, but also held at [25] that by doing so it exercised a re-sentencing of the applicant, so that the Court could have regard to matters occurring since the original sentence was imposed.  
     
      
    19 Similarly in this case, the following of the wrong procedure in pronouncing the sentence constituted an error which enables this Court to re-sentence the applicant, and I deal with this aspect later. 
     
      
    20 The second ground of appeal was that the learned Sentencing Judge erred in failing to discount the sentence imposed on the applicant by reason of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    21 In the guideline judgment of R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 at [160] sentencing judges were encouraged to specify the discount allowed for the utilitarian value of any plea of guilty as opposed to its relevance as evidence of remorse and contrition, and the saving of the requirement for vulnerable witnesses to give evidence, but it was further said at [113] that in appropriate cases it may be appropriate to specify a single discount to cover all aspects of the plea of guilty, and the failure to specify the amount of discount for the plea of guilty did not necessarily constitute error: at [72]. In all cases the important consideration is to expose the transparency of the process so that it can be seen that an appropriate discount has been allowed: at [162]. The utilitarian value of a plea is to be assessed by reference to the stage at which the plea is entered and the complexity and length of the trial in the absence of such a plea: at [154]. 
     
      
    22 In R v Lloyd at [2003] NSWCCA 49, a 2 judge bench held that notwithstanding a reference by the Sentencing Judge to the fact that the pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court, as there was no express reference to the utilitarian value of the plea, and having regard to the length of the sentence imposed, they were satisfied that the Judge had failed to give effect to the utilitarian value of the pleas and allow an appropriate discount. 
     
      
    23 On the other hand, in R v Galati [2003] NSWCCA 148 (another decision of a 2 judge bench) the Sentencing Judge had begun his Remarks on Sentence with a reference to the fact that the pleas were entered before the Local Court and so should be regarded as entered at the earliest opportunity, but made no further reference to their utilitarian value or any specific discount. It was submitted that these factors together with the fact that the sentences were expressed in round figures, suggested that no discount had been allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and that R v Lloyd should be followed with a similar result. 
     
      
    24 However at [23] James J (with whom Smart AJ agreed) rejected that submission, stating that whilst it would have been desirable for the Sentencing Judge to have quantified the discount he was allowing for the utilitarian value of the pleas, his Honour was clearly mindful of the pleas of guilty and that they had been entered at the earliest available opportunity, and concluded that, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences and a number of negative subjective circumstances, the sentences imposed by their leniency did disclose that a significant discount had been allowed for the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    25 In my opinion, similar considerations apply in the present case. His Honour in his Remarks on Sentence not only noted the plea of guilty, observed that it demonstrated remorse and contrition, and that the applicant was entitled to a discount on penalty on account of that, but went on to observe that he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Again later in his Remarks, he again referred to the fact that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    26 This was a very serious offence. Not only did the victim require 10 sutures to her throat leaving her with some disfigurement, but having regard to the location and size of the laceration, she was lucky that her injury was not more serious or possibly even fatal. 
     
      
    27 Having regard to his Honour’s vast experience in sentencing matters, the two references to the plea being entered at the earliest opportunity, and the comparatively lenient sentence imposed for an offence of this seriousness in the light of the applicant’s prior record, I cannot conceive that his Honour failed to take into account the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty or failed to allow a discount in respect of it within the range indicated in R v Thomson.  
     
      
    28 Moreover, I consider that the sentence imposed by his Honour, effectively a head sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, was such that for an offence of this seriousness, no lesser sentence would have been appropriate. I also note that, having regard to the circumstances and prior record of the applicant, it is well within the middle range of the statistics for this offence maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. 
     
      
    29 However, because of his Honour’s error in relation to s 44, it is necessary to re-sentence the applicant. This renders admissible the affidavits that have been filed which set out the progress made by the applicant whilst in prison, and the fact that he has undertaken with the victim’s family the “Closure Conference”, and that the victim has forgiven him.  
     
      
    30 The progress made by the applicant whilst in prison is only such as his Honour anticipated at the time of sentencing, as is the forgiveness by the victim who had written a letter to the Court prior to sentencing supportive of the applicant, and in any event forgiveness by the victim is only of limited relevance: R v Rowe (1996) A Crim R 467, R v Glen (CCA – 19 December 1994) The only matter that is really fresh is the Closure Conference. This is significant and I have taken it into account, but in all the circumstances, having regard to the seriousness of the offence, I am not satisfied that this is a case where a lesser sentence should now be imposed.  
     
      
    31 It is however necessary to re-sentence the applicant in accordance with the Act as it stood prior to the 2002 amendments. Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentence imposed by the District Court, and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 3 years to date from 5 November 2002 and fix a non-parole period of 2 years expiring on 4 November 2004, and I would confirm the order for his release on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period subject to the conditions specified by the District Court. 
     
      
    32 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     
      
    33 JAMES J: I agree.

     SUMMARY 
      
    The appellants appeal against convictions following their joint trial in the District Court before Judge Michael Finnane QC and a jury. The jury returned guilty verdicts on most of the Counts each appellant was charged with.The charges relate to a series of sexual assaults at various locations in south western Sydney that occurred in the evening of 30 August 2000. The victim of these assaults was Ms T, then aged 18. The appellants were aged between 17 and 18. The offences took place at the Marion Street car park toilet block, the car park of the Bankstown Trotting Club and an industrial estate at Chullora.1. GROUNDS OF APPEALMOHAMED GHANEM was charged and convicted of one count of detain for sexual advantage and four counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. He was convicted on three of these counts and the trial judge directed a verdict of not guilty on the fourth charge. He argued seven grounds of appeal (see page 30 for each ground of appeal) including that Judge Finnane should not have allowed telephone intercept evidence to be admitted (Ground 3); and that his directions concerning this evidence were wrong (Ground 4). He also argued that he should have had a separate trial (Ground 5). The Court upholds Grounds 3 and 4. These grounds are linked and the Court finds that Ground 4 entitles Ghanem to a new trial (see paras 189 – 190). Grounds 3 and 4 concerned two telephone calls Chami made to Ghanem whilst Chami was interviewed by police. The calls were intercepted by the police. Transcript of the calls was tendered at trial. During these two calls Chami made incriminatory statements concerning himself (see paras 171 –174). The substance of Ground 3 was whether Chami’s statements also incriminated Ghanem (see para 173). Ghanem submitted that Judge Finnane should not have allowed the telephone call evidence to be admitted against him on any basis. Judge Finnane ruled that the evidence was admissible to show Chami’s consciousness of guilt but could not be used for this purpose in relation to Ghanem. Nevertheless, in his reasons Judge Finnane said the evidence was available to show ‘close association’ or ‘deep interest…’ or ‘an association between two people having an interest …’ (see para 175). Ghanem argued that the ruling by Judge Finnane was tantamount to an endorsement of guilt by association. The Court agrees with Ghanem’s submission. The Court finds that Chami’s paramount concern during the telephone calls was for himself. Ghanem gave him a sympathetic ear (the friendship between the men had been established at trial and was not in dispute), but Ghanem did not adopt Chami’s inculpatory statements or otherwise implicate himself. The evidence was therefore not relevant to any case against Ghanem (see para 177). The Court finds that this evidence was unfairly prejudicial and outweighed any probative force. The Court compared this situation to a person who visits a friend in gaol. It would be wrong to infer from this alone that the association is improper (see para 178).Ground 4 of the appeal concerned directions given by Judge Finnane to the jury about the telephone intercept evidence. The Court finds that a part of the Crown’s directions to the jury misrepresented the telephone conversations and this made it even more important for the jury to be directed against using the intercept evidence to infer consciousness of guilt. No such directions were given (see para 184). The Court upholds this ground of appeal especially since it is linked to Ground 3. MAHMOUD CHAMI was charged and convicted of one count of detain for sexual advantage and one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. He argued eight grounds of appeal. Each ground fails. Broadly speaking his grounds of appeal concerned how Judge Finnane conducted the trial (see pages 29 – 30 for each ground of appeal). BILAL SKAF was charged and convicted of two counts of aggravated indecent assault; two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and one count of detain for sexual advantage. He was also charged with two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice to which he pleaded guilty during the trial. The jury could not agree on a further count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. He argued four grounds of appeal. Each ground fails. The grounds included that the jury’s verdicts were unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence (see pages 30 and 31 for each ground of appeal). MOHAMMED SKAF was charged and convicted of two counts of detain for sexual advantage and two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent.Mohammed SKAF argued nine grounds of appeal. Each ground fails (see pages 31 – 32 for each ground of appeal). The appeals included that Judge Finnane gave incorrect directions and warnings to the jury and miscarriages of justice occurred because some of Judge Finnane’s directions unfairly prejudiced Skaf or that Judge Finnane lacked balance.2. FORMAL COURT ORDERSThe appeals against conviction of Mahmoud Chami, Bilal Skaf and Mohammed Skaf are dismissed. Mohamed Ghanem’s appeal is allowed, his conviction and sentence are set aside and a new trial is ordered.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 THE COURT: The four appellants were tried together in the District Court before Judge Finnane QC and a jury. 
     
      
       
      
    2 The charges related to a series of sexual assaults at various locations in south western Sydney that occurred in the evening of 30 August 2000. Ms T, the complainant, was aged 18. The appellants were aged between 17 and 18 at the time. 
     
      
       
        
       The Crown case 
       
      
    3 The complainant boarded a train at Belmore, intending to go to Lidcombe. She was sitting reading when approached by a group of five young males. The Crown case was that these men were: 
     
      
       
       •  
       Mohammed Skaf 
       , the appellant 
        
        
       •  
       H 
       , a pseudonym for a person whose name has been suppressed 
        
        
       •  
       Tayyab Sheikh 
        
        
       •  
       Mohammed Sanoussi 
        
        
       •  
       Mahmoud Sanoussi 
        
       
      
    4 Mohammed Skaf was described by the complainant as wearing a yellow jumper and having a really big nose and curly short hair with blond streaks. He sat in front of the complainant and engaged her in friendly conversation. Having ascertained that she had tried marijuana he asked her if she wanted to smoke some with them. She agreed to do so and to continue with the men to Bankstown Station. She told them that her name was “Amanda”, which was untrue. 
     
      
       
      
    5 During the train ride some of the males touched her suggestively. In Ms T’s words, the man in the yellow jumper had “tried to touch me a few times… but I didn’t really think that much of it… I remember him in particular saying that I had nice legs”.  
     
      
       
      
    6 Closed circuit television at Bankstown Station provided video evidence corroborating the arrival of the group and assisting identification to some degree. The complainant is seen on the platform with five males, the male in the yellow jumper holding his arm around her as they walk off the platform in a group. 
     
      
       
      
    7 The complainant sent a mobile text message to her friend Leah Nightingale and told her to call her. When Leah rang back, the complainant made it sound as if she was talking to her sister, that their mother had been in an accident and that she had to go home. The complainant said that she was starting to feel nervous and that she wanted an excuse to go home without antagonising the men. The other males “had sort of gotten a bit more gropey, they were trying to touch me a lot more and I was starting to get a bit nervous about them” (Tr p47). (See also Tr pp133-5, 437) 
     
      
       
      
    8 The male in the yellow jumper took Ms T’s phone and started speaking to Leah. He told her “I’ll have her home in ten minutes” and hung up on her. He then placed the phone down the front of his pants. The complainant asked for her phone back and was told “No. I’ll give it back to you after we’ve smoken”.  
     
      
       
      
    9 The complainant’s friend Leah corroborated this evidence about the disguised phone call and the complainant’s nervous or panicky state (Tr pp455-6). She said that she was told by the male speaker “Listen bitch, your sister will be home in ten to twenty minutes.” He refused to let Leah speak to the complainant and hung up. When Leah phoned back the phone was switched off. By this time three of the five males had moved away. The complainant remained with the male in the yellow jumper (Mohammed Skaf) and a male with badly streaked hair. They walked her to the nearby Marion Street car park. 
     
      
       
      
    10 The male in the yellow jumper went into the toilet block for a couple of minutes. He came back out and said “You’re up”. The male with the streaked hair had been talking to the complainant in the meantime and he had asked her if she did threesomes: she told him “No, I don’t do things like that”. 
     
      
       
      
    11 The complainant followed the male in the yellow jumper into the toilet block. He took her mobile phone out of his pants, held it up in the air and said “You won’t get your phone back until you fuck me”. She replied “Fuck the phone, I’m going home” and she tried to get out. She pushed the door to get out, but did not realize that it opened the other way. She heard voices from the outside and assumed that the other males had been holding the door closed. 
     
      
       
      
    12 The male reached for her shoulders and she dodged him to get away and found herself further away from the door. She was now near the toilet. The male approached her and pushed her up against the tiled wall, turned her around and pulled down her skirt and underwear. This was the basis of Count 1 against Mohammed Skaf – detain for sexual advantage. 
     
      
       
      
    13 The male told her “I’m going to fuck you Leb style”. He put on a condom (which had been purchased when he had entered a pink building housing a sex shop on the way between the station and the car park). 
     
      
       
      
    14 Mohammed Skaf stood behind her, pinning her up against the wall and penetrated his penis in her vagina. At the time she heard the other males outside. When he finished it seemed to the complainant that he was not allowed to get out of the cubicle without communicating (in Lebanese) with the men on the outside. This assault, in the company of others, was the subject of Count 2 against Mohammed Skaf – aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
       
      
    15 The complainant was thereafter subjected to a series of sexual assaults in the toilet from the males she had met on the train, with the exception of H. During this time she heard her mobile phone’s ring tone. The male in the yellow jumper had earlier placed it back in his pocket (Tr p56). 
     
      
       
      
    16 The assaults in the toilet (after that involving Mohammed Skaf) first involved an incident in which two males entered the toilet block. The complainant was lifted down from the toilet seat by one of them, who pulled down her skirt and underwear, pushed her up against the wall and placed his finger into her vagina. He then wore a condom and placed his penis into her vagina. After this, the man alleged to be Mohammed Sanousi entered as the complainant was fixing herself up. She had fallen to her knees. He said “you’re in the position to suck my dick” and he put his penis into her mouth. She tried to pull away. He grabbed her hair and moved her head around his penis all the way down her throat which made her gag. When this male left, the one with the “badly streaked hair” returned. He sat on the toilet, opened his legs and pulled down his pants. He grabbed the complainant and forced his penis into her mouth. She was still in a kneeling position. 
     
      
       
      
    17 Evidence was led that H, Tayyab Sheikh, Mohammed Sanoussi and Mahmoud Sanoussi had also been charged and were being dealt with in other proceedings. 
     
      
       
      
    18 The evidence of these other sexual assaults in the toilet was led without objection and was not the subject of any cross-examination. It was obviously relevant to the issue of consent as regards what followed, and debatably as regards what preceded it (see below: Mohammed Skaf’s ground of appeal). 
     
      
       
      
    19 The complainant was left on her own inside the toilet. She cried. She then got dressed, washed herself and walked outside. A dark-skinned woman in her early thirties approached her and asked if she was OK. The woman asked if she had any money. Believing that the woman was offering help, the complainant gave her $20 expecting her to call a taxi. The woman told the complainant “You know this is a bad area, you should have known better”. She put her arm around the complainant and led her to a nearby area where there were a group of males outside a black car. The complainant noticed the male with the large build (H) and a couple of males who had been with her earlier. Two of the males then left with the woman. Mohammed Skaf was also there. The complainant asked him where her phone was and he said that “his mate George had it and that he would come back with it in a few minutes”. He left and did not return (Tr p61).  
     
      
       
      
    20 Thinking that she was safe, the complainant got into the black car containing two previously unencountered males and H. The complainant described it as a black two door hatchback that looked new. She thought she would be taken to the police. There was talk about retrieving her phone. H left the car and spoke to Mohammed Skaf, returning with the complainant’s SIM card. He said that they could not get her phone back. As the black car drove off from the area, the complainant saw the male in the yellow jumper (Mohammed Skaf) and the male in the orange jumper (Mohammed Sanoussi) sitting in a hot food shop. The black car was driven from the Marion Street car park to Bankstown Trotting Club, stopping en route to buy food at McDonalds. It was near to dusk when they got to the Trotting Club.  
     
      
       
      
    21 H committed a further sexual assault on the complainant near a shed in the deserted car park. After this, the black car reappeared and its driver told the complainant that he would take her home. She trusted him and got into the front passenger seat. He then forced his finger into her vagina. Later he required her to climb into the back seat where he undressed her and had forced penile vaginal sex. After this another man who had been a passenger in the black car got into the back seat and had forced oral sex. 
     
      
       
      
    22 The complainant tried to get out of the car after she had fixed herself up. Someone held the door closed and told her “wait in here” (Tr p72). 
     
      
       
      
    23 The complainant then saw a red car drive into the car park of the Bankstown Trotting Club. There were four males in that car. The complainant had not seen them before. The driver and passenger from the black car went up to the males in the red car and they appeared to talk to each other. The driver of the black car returned and opened the passenger door to let the complainant out saying “You’re going with these guys. They’re going to take you home”. 
     
      
       
      
    24 The complainant got into the red car believing what she had been told. She got into the middle of the back seat. It was the Crown case that the men in the red car were: 
     
      
       
        
       •  
       Mahmoud Chami 
        (the driver and, for this the Crown relied mainly on Chami’s admission in his ERISP of 13 October 2000). He was described by the complainant as having short, cropped hair, bushy eyebrows, bulging eyes and he was wearing a big black jacket. 
        
        
       •  
       Mohamed Ghanem 
        (the front passenger, and for this the Crown relied on the complainant’s subsequent identification of Ghanem from a photoboard). He was described by the complainant as having his hair in a pony tail which had curls and was blondish at the ends and he was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and bone coloured cargo pants. 
        
        
       •  
       Bilal Skaf 
        (the back passenger, sitting to the left of the complainant, and for this the Crown relied on the complainant’s subsequent identification of Bilal Skaf from a photoboard). He was described by the complainant as calling himself  
       “Sam” 
       , with dark eyes, short dark hair, bushy eyebrows and he was wearing a grey Adidas jumper. The complainant said that she remembered  
       “something about gold, a gold necklace or gold” 
        (Tr pp77, 386). He was often referred to as “Adidas Sam” in later evidence. 
        
        
       • A fourth unidentified male (the back passenger, sitting to the right of the complainant). He was described by the complainant as having short curly hair with blonde or gold on the tips and wearing a grey Nike jumper. He also called himself Sam. 
        
       
      
    25 The red car was driven to a townhouse complex where it stopped for a few minutes while the driver got out and entered a house. The house was subsequently identified by the complainant as being opposite Chami’s house. Count 3 charged Chami, Ghanem and Bilal Skaf with detaining for sexual advantage. This count spanned the luring and detaining of the complainant in the red car in the circumstances set out below. 
     
      
       
      
    26 As the complainant was being driven in the red car the two males sitting on either side of her in the back seat started to touch her. They touched her upper thighs and legs and her left breast. Count 4 charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated indecent assault in relation to the touching of her breasts. They also grabbed her hands and put them around each of their exposed penises and moved her hands up and down. They prevented her from pulling her hands away. Count 5 charged Bilal Skaf with an aggravated act of indecency in relation to this incident. 
     
      
       
      
    27 The two Sams then started pulling up her skirt and took turns in putting their fingers into her vagina. Afterwards they both did it together at the same time. Count 6 charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
       
      
    28 The complainant was crying during these assaults. She was scared that the men would rape her and thought that they would take her home if she did what they wanted. The complainant said that the front passenger was turning around and watching the activities of the two men beside her. 
     
      
       
      
    29 The car was then driven to a service station not far from the townhouse complex. The front passenger (Ghanem, on the Crown case) got out. The complainant attempted to climb out of the car from the front seat. The driver (Chami) grabbed her left shoulder and pushed her down. He opened the glove box and “took a weapon and held it to my head”. The complainant felt “cold metal” and thought it was a gun, though she did not see it. The driver told her “don’t move bitch or you’re dead”. He then put the weapon back and the front passenger returned to the red car. 
     
      
       
      
    30 The complainant was then driven to an industrial estate in Chullora. Everybody except the driver got out of the car. The two males who had been sitting in the back seat held the doors so the complainant could not get out and the driver got into the back seat. It was dark by this time. 
     
      
       
      
    31 The driver of the red car unzipped his pants when he sat next to the complainant in the back seat. She said “You’re not going to do it too?” and he said “Fuck me”. He put a condom on his penis, pushed the complainant on to her back and pulled up her skirt. He pulled down her underwear, spread her legs open and had penile vaginal intercourse with her. She was crying at the time. Count 7 charged Chami with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. During this incident the complainant recalled that a blanket was placed over the car. 
     
      
       
      
    32 The driver got out and the male with the pony tail who had been the front passenger came inside the red car. The male said “he wanted a little bit of head before he fucked” and he pulled down her shoulders so that she was almost on all fours. He grabbed her hair and forced her face towards his penis. She tried not to let it go in her mouth and he pulled her even harder and put his penis into her mouth. She bit down on it and he slapped her across the top of her head. He grabbed her hair and forced his penis further down her throat and she started to gag. Count 8 charged Ghanem with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
       
      
    33 This male then pushed the complainant’s head back. She sat back up in a kneeling position. He made her sit on him and he had vaginal sex. She was crying at the time and she believed that a condom was used. Count 9 charged Ghanem with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The complainant recalled looking at this male’s face, and she remembered that he “was actually good looking” (Tr p83).  
     
      
       
      
    34 When that male left the car the unidentified “Sam” wearing the grey Nike jumper came inside and forced his penis into her mouth.  
     
      
       
      
    35 The male called “Sam” in the grey Adidas jumper (Bilal Skaf, on the Crown case) then came into the car. The complainant was crying and he pushed her legs open, straddled her and placed his penis into her vagina. Count 10 charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent.36 The male with the pony tail came back via the left side of the car. The complainant was sitting in the middle, crying. He grabbed her shoulders and forced her onto all fours. He unzipped his pants and forced his penis into her mouth. Count 11 charged Ghanem with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
       
      
    37 Not long afterwards, this male yelled out “How about a threesome” and the male called “Sam” in the grey Adidas jumper reentered the car and put his penis into the complainant’s anus while she was on all fours. At the same time the male with the pony tail had his penis in her mouth. Count 12 charged Bilal Skaf with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent in relation to this incident. 
     
      
       
      
    38 The Crown originally indicted Ghanem on a further count (Count 13) of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent in respect of the incident referred to in the previous paragraph. Since however the complainant explained in her evidence that when the male with the pony tail had yelled out “how about a threesome” his penis had remained in her mouth throughout that time, the judge later directed a verdict by direction on Count 13 because the offence in Count 11 had not ceased. 
     
      
       
      
    39 The complainant said that throughout the sexual assaults in the red car she heard mobile phones ringing and people talking on the phone (Tr p82). Around this time she saw a black car arrive. She said it was “a black car, similar to the first”, but was not sure whether it was the same car as the one previously involved (Tr p88). There were three males in it along with the male in the yellow jumper who had first met the complainant on the train and who had also sexually assaulted her in the toilet block (Mohammed Skaf, on the Crown case). She heard the ring tone of her phone, which was a particular song by Eminem (Tr p88). This evidence was used to corroborate the Crown case that Mohammed Skaf arrived at the industrial complex in the black car. (He admitted his presence at the Marion Street toilet block, but disputed that he was at the industrial complex.)40 The complainant got out of the red car, which was then driven away towards the driveway of the industrial estate where it was hosed down. The black car was parked where the red car had previously been. The complainant attempted to leave and started walking past the red car. She was hosed down by someone from the red car and ended up soaking wet (Tr p89). She started crying and the males laughed. The complainant managed to reach the street but was caught by one of the “new people” and was led back to the industrial estate. By the time she had been walked back she noticed that the red car and its occupants were gone.  
     
      
       
      
    41 The male in the yellow jumper came up to her, put his arm around her and led her away from the remaining group of males. He said “I have to talk to you” and she was taken to an area where there was a pile of sacks. Count 14 charged Mohammed Skaf with detain for advantage.  
     
      
       
      
    42 This male told the complainant to “Suck my dick again bitch”, and she did as she was told because she was scared of getting hurt. She was still crying. (Count 15 charged Mohammed Skaf with aggravated sexual intercourse without consent.) (The complainant volunteered that she had not had oral sex with the male in the yellow jumper at the toilet block (Tr p89) but she adhered to the evidence that the same man was involved in the two separate assaults. This was material relied upon by Mohammed Skaf to challenge the complainant’s identification of him as the male in the yellow jumper at the industrial estate.) 
     
      
       
      
    43 After this, the complainant grabbed his penis hard and told him to give her back her phone because she wanted to call someone to get her out of there (Tr p89). He called out, “Get the gun, get the gun”. Another male (one of the new people not recognized by the complainant) said “Get her phone back”. 
     
      
       
      
    44 There were other sexual assaults by occupants of the black car. 
     
      
       
      
    45 The complainant was told to get back into the black car, which had been driven over to the area with the sacks. She complied. Just before the car pulled out of the driveway, the person in the yellow jumper came up to the driver’s side window and passed her mobile through to the person who had just assaulted her. He was seated next to her in the back of the car. He handed the phone to her and told her to put her SIM card in it, which she did. He asked for her phone number because he was going to ring her the next day. He told her to give him the right phone number because he was going to try it there and then to see if her phone rang. She did as she required and the number was successfully tested as she was driven to Lidcombe station (Tr p94). Mohammed Skaf’s mobile phone was found to contain the complainant’s number listed in it, showing her name as “Amanda”, the name she had given on the train. 
     
      
       
      
    46 The complainant was then driven to Lidcombe station and was told not to call the police. After being left she started to receive calls on her mobile. One was from her friend Leah, who came to pick her up with Leah’s mother. It was now between 10 and 11pm.  
     
      
       
      
    47 Before she was picked up she heard her mobile phone ring several times. She “knew it was them” (Tr p96) and didn’t answer, except for one call, which came from H to whom she had given her number earlier in the evening (Tr p220). After she was picked up, Leah answered the calls, some of whom were men asking to talk to her and Leah was heard telling them abusively not to contact her. 
     
      
       
      
    48 The complainant did not go to the police until the next day because she was too distraught. 
     
      
       
      
    49 The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all remaining counts except Count 12 (upon which they were unable to agree) and Count 13 (on which there was a verdict by direction). 
     
      
       
      
    50 There were two additional counts (16 and 17) charging Bilal Skaf in relation to attempted perverting of the course of justice. They relate to conduct occurring on 14 November 2000 referred to below. During the trial he pleaded guilty to these charges. 
     
      
       
        
       The defence cases in brief 
       
      
    51 It is convenient to record the nub of the defence case raised at trial by each accused. 
     
      
       
      
    52 Chami’s case was that he had oral, not vaginal sex. He did not suggest consent, but raised a mistaken belief as to consent. Chami did not give evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    53 Ghanem’s case was that he had been wrongly identified and that he had an alibi. He gave evidence at trial. 
     
      
       
      
    54 Bilal Skaf gave no evidence at trial. His defence was that he had been wrongly identified. 
     
      
       
      
    55 Mohammed Skaf gave no evidence at trial. He asserted consensual sexual intercourse in the Marion Street carpark toilet. And he denied that he was the man in the yellow jumper who assaulted the complainant at the industrial complex. 
     
      
       
        
       Events prior to the trial 
       
      
    56 When she was left at Lidcombe Station the complainant called her friend Ms Nightingale and reported the assaults to her. She went to the police the next day. 
     
      
       
      
    57 The police took photos of the locations identified by the complainant. Unfortunately the toilets at the Marion Street car park had been cleaned.  
     
      
       
      
    58 The complainant was medically examined in the evening following the assaults. She gave a history to the doctor. Swabs revealed no DNA evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    59 The complainant gave her first statement to the police on 1 September 2000.  
     
      
       
      
    60 On 14 September she told Senior Constable Brazel that she had been confused as to the sequence of events in that statement. The officer took six pages of notes during the ensuing conversation.  
     
      
       
      
    61 On 21 September the complainant provided a second statement which varied from the first in a number of respects. Her evidence at trial was generally in accord with this second statement. She explained the material discrepancies on the basis of distress and confusion and said that she had been able to put things into correct sequence and make material adjustments as the result of ""flashbacks"" as she dreamt and thought about her ordeal. Flashbacks in the nature of nightmares led to corrections in her second statement (251, 374ff) which was made with the assistance of a police officer (268). In the first statement there were “a lot of things … out of synch and things were omitted” (395). Needless to say, the complainant was cross-examined vigorously on these matters. In re-examination, the complainant explained her use of “flash-back” as the equivalent of using a videotape to relive or flash-back to the earlier time (Tr p438). 
     
      
       
      
    62 The police compiled photoboards each with 15 photos of young men of ""Lebanese"" appearance. On 26 September the complainant identified Mohamed Skaf as the man in the yellow jumper (Ex C3, photo 14). On 15 November she identified Ghanem (Ex C6, photo 4) and Bilal Skaf (Ex C5, photo 15). The latter two identifications remain in dispute. The complainant did not identify the appellant Chami. 
     
      
       
      
    63 The complainant also made positive identifications of ""H"", Tayyab Sheikh, Mohammed Sanoussi and Mahmoud Sanoussi. 
     
      
       
      
    64 Police searches at the homes of the suspects had limited success in locating clothes and jewellery mentioned by the complainant in her descriptions of various assailants. However, on 8 October during a search at the home of Bilal and Mohammed Skaf, police found a yellow, long-sleeved jumper with a ""Champion"" logo at the bottom of the wardrobe in the brothers' bedroom. 
     
      
       
      
    65 It was established that Chami owned a red four-door Toyota Corolla. On 13 October 2000 the complainant identified that car to the police as the car in which she had been assaulted at the industrial estate. No relevant fingerprints were located in the car. 
     
      
       
      
    66 Mobile telephones belonging to the suspects were seized. Information obtained from them was used to establish that the young men had each other's numbers coded into their own phones. The police were also able to establish that the phones were used on 30 August 2000 and the approximate location of their use. Evidence was led at trial that calls were made or text messages sent between various phones at critical times. 
     
      
       
      
    67 Bilal Skaf and Ghanem were arrested and charged on 6 December 2000. Both declined to be interviewed. 
     
      
       
      
    68 Mohammed Skaf was interviewed by the police on four occasions: at 4:16 am and 8:46 am on 2 September 2000, on 7 October 2000 and on 13 November 2000. He was arrested and charged on 7 October 2000.  
     
      
       
      
    69 In the first interview on 2 September he told the police that on 30 August he and his family had driven to Canberra with his cousin Tayyab Sheikh. They went to a go-cart racetrack and stayed the night at a Formula 1 motel. He said he had won a certificate for having come third in a go-cart race. During this interview, he was shown video surveillance footage taken from Bankstown railway station on 30 August 2000. He denied that he was the male in the yellow jumper. He denied any knowledge of the complainant and said that he had never had sex in his life. The interview was suspended to arrange an identification parade, but in the second interview that day Mohammed Skaf confirmed that he had decided not to go in a line-up parade because of the time it would take to organise. 
     
      
       
      
    70 At the start of the third interview (on 7 October) he said that he had come with proof of his attendance at the go-cart racetrack in Canberra. He again gave details about this trip. He was told that police inquiries revealed that the track was not open to the public on 30 August 2000 and that there was no Formula 1 motel in Canberra. Despite this, he adhered to his alibi. He told the police that he owned a ""Champion"" brand yellow top, which was at his house. (As indicated, the jumper was located at his house on 8 October 2000.)  
     
      
       
      
    71 The fourth interview (on 13 November 2000) occurred after he approached the police. He admitted that he had lied about going to Canberra. This was because he did not want his parents to know that he had had sex with a girl. He admitted that he was the male person wearing the yellow jumper in the video footage from Bankstown railway station. He gave a version of events on 30 August 2000. He and others approached the girl on the train. He asked her whether she wanted to come with them to have a bit of ""guys fun"". She didn't really mind and agreed in effect to have sex with him so long as his friends would not be around. She got off at Bankstown station. He put his hand around her and they walked up the stairs. There was discussion about him getting condoms which were then bought from a pink coloured adult shop. He and Tayyab Sheikh went with the girl to the car park in Marion Street. It was there that the girl rang her sister in relation to the time she would be home. He denied using or taking her phone. He said that he and the girl went into the toilet block and spoke about how they would ""do it"". She took off her skirt and sat on top of him as he sat on the toilet seat. He wore a condom and they had intercourse for about a minute. The girl had been happy to have sex. He had closed the door so no one would come in. Afterwards, he walked outside and saw the others outside the toilet block. He told them what he had done with the girl. Tayyab Sheikh then went inside the toilet block. When Tayyab came out, he left with him and they caught a bus. The others said that they would give the girl a lift home. He arrived home at 4:30 pm. His cousins were there, including Ali Skaf and Susan Bakry, as well as Bilal Skaf, Tayyab Sheikh and Tahir Sheikh. He did things and went to various places but had nothing further to do with the girl they had met on the train. Around 11 pm he received a call on his mobile from ""H"" who said that he and his mates had taken the girl to Flemington markets and that they all ""went through her"". Mohammed Skaf told the police that the complainant had given him her number when he had first met her, but later in the interview he said that it was after he had had sexual intercourse with her in the toilet that he asked for her number and she gave it to him. He saved it in his mobile phone. 
     
      
       
      
    72 On 8 November 2000 counsel appearing for Mohammed Skaf handed the police a piece of paper with the names and phone numbers of people who could support his client's Canberra alibi. These people were interviewed by police and statements were taken. One of the people was Bilal Skaf and his statement was given on 14 November 2000 (Ex C17). That statement did not support Mohammed Skaf’s Canberra alibi, but it was to the effect that Bilal had been home all day and that his brother Mohammed had been at home for most of the evening in question, including between 4pm and 5pm and around 8.15pm. During the course of the trial Bilal Skaf entered pleas of guilty to counts 16 and 17 in the indictment (Tr p495). These were charges of perverting the course of justice through making a false statement on 14 November 2000 and of inciting Susan Bakry to make a false statement (in which she corroborated Bilal Skaf's false statement). Over objection, the Crown relied on Bilal Skaf’s false statement as evidence of his consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
       
      
    73 Chami was interviewed by the police on 13 October 2000 and was thereafter arrested and charged. He told the police that on 30 August 2000 he had been phoned by Bilal Skaf who said that there was ""a slut"" at the Bankstown Trotting Club who “was going through one guy after another”, that his brother was with her, and that he wanted a lift there. Chami drove Bilal Skaf to the Bankstown Trotting Club. On the way Bilal Skaf used Chami's mobile to ring ""H"". Chami gave differing versions of what followed. One of them was to the effect that the girl consented to have oral sex with him in the back seat of the red car. Chami denied the complainant's allegations of being forced to have sex with other men in the red car at the industrial estate. He also told police that there had not been any gun in his car. [During the trial Chami’s counsel did not suggest to the complainant that she consented. It was clarified during submissions that Chami relied upon honest but mistaken belief as to consent: Tr pp1162-8, 1221 cf 1216.] 
     
      
       
      
    74 During a break in Chami's interview at about 11:30am Chami made telephone calls from his mobile that were intercepted by police and recorded. Translations of these conversations were tendered, over objection. They were ruled admissible to show a consciousness of guilt on the part of Chami and to show that Ghanem (who was one of the people called) had a ""deep interest"" in what Chami was saying. This ruling is challenged in the appeal by Ghanem and Chami.   
     
      
       
       The cases at trial in detail 
       
      
    75 Early in the summing up, Judge Finnane provided the jury with a typed summary of the facts arising in the respective cases of the four accused. This helpful document reminded the jury of the particular charges faced by each accused and of the evidence, including exhibits, in the Crown case and defence case (if any) respectively. The list merely summarised the name of any important witness and the number and identity of any relevant exhibit. 
     
      
       
        
        
       (a)  
       Chami 
       
      
    76 Chami stood trial on Counts 3 (detain for sexual advantage) and 7 (sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation). These related to the events at the industrial estate in Chullora to which Chami had admittedly driven the complainant after he picked her up with Bilal Skaf and others at the Bankstown Trotting Club.  
     
      
       
      
    77 There was no photoboard identification of Chami by the complainant. However, he admitted his presence to the police, asserting consensual activity on the complainant’s part. 
     
      
       
      
    78 Chami did not give evidence at the trial. His case was presented through cross-examination of the complainant and his reliance upon matters raised in his ERISP on 13 October 2000. He also led evidence of good character based on the absence of previous criminal convictions and the testimony of three character witnesses. 
     
      
       
      
    79 In effect, Chami denied that the complainant was detained in his red car. He also said that the complainant gave him consensual oral sex, thereby putting the Crown to proof that the complainant had not consented and that he knew or was recklessly indifferent as to her lack of consent.  
     
      
       
      
    80 There were three major items of evidence in the Crown case.  
     
      
       
      
    81 The first was the evidence of the complainant. That included her account of the sexual assaults at the Marion Street car park toilets, at the Bankstown Trotting Club and in the drive to the secluded industrial estate. During the drive a weapon had been produced by Chami, according to the complainant. These matters were relevant to the issues of detention and lack of consent to any form of sexual encounter by the time she had been brought to the industrial estate. Chami's ERISP squarely raised a claim that the complainant had consensual oral sex with him in the back seat of his car at the industrial estate. However, the issue of consent was not raised in cross-examination of the complainant by his counsel, who merely put it to the complainant that she was not crying and that she appeared to Chami as someone who was willing to have sexual relations with him (Tr pp289-90). The complainant denied these propositions. It was also put to the complainant that no vaginal sex took place, a proposition that she denied (Tr p283). It would have been most surprising if the jury had entertained a reasonable doubt on the issue of consent. In this Court, senior counsel for Chami confirmed that the only issue raised in relation to count 7 concerned Chami's state of mind. 
     
      
       
      
    82 The second piece of evidence was Chami's ERISP. It too would not have impressed the jury. Chami said that Bilal Skaf phoned him and told him there was ""a slut"" at the Bankstown Trotting Club who ""was going through one guy after another"". Bilal's brother was with her and Bilal wanted a lift there. Chami drove Bilal Skaf to the Club. On the way Bilal Skaf used Chami's phone to contact ""H"". When they got to the Club the sun had gone down. Bilal Skaf spoke to ""H"". Then the girl and Bilal Skaf got into his car. Bilal Skaf said ""let's go somewhere quiet"". As they drove along Bilal Skaf told him ""where a good spot is"". Chami said ""I thought that he just wanted to be alone with her and he wanted to have sex with her or something like that, you know"". He heard the complainant saying to Bilal Skaf a few times ""take me home, take me home, I need to go home, are you gunna take me home?"" Chami described the industrial estate to which they drove as the ""Greenacre wrecking yards"".  
     
      
       
      
    83 Chami's initial version of what happened at the industrial complex was that he let Bilal Skaf and the girl out of the car and drove away, spending the rest of the evening in various vaguely identified locations. 
     
      
       
      
    84 The interview was suspended and, upon resumption, Chami agreed that during the interval he had told the interviewing officer that he had not been completely honest about what happened when he arrived at the industrial estate. He then gave a version which involved Bilal Skaf getting out, leaving Chami sitting in the car. Chami ""ended up jumping in the back seat"". He then gave differing versions of what happened, some involving him initiating the sexual encounter, others suggesting that it was the girl who proposed it. Common to each version was the fact that the couple discussed having sex, but that this idea had been rejected by Chami himself because he did not have a condom. The girl then offered him a ""head job"" and started to give him one. There was no force. ""She wanted to do it, she wanted to do it"". Later in the interview Chami agreed that the girl had asked Bilal Skaf to take her home as they drove to the industrial complex. He said ""so she must have known that there was something gunna happen as well, and she, and Bill said, yeah, I'll take you home after we're finished"". In fact the girl was not taken home by them after they had ""finished"". After Chami left the car park the black car pulled in and the girl was left in the care of its occupants. Chami gave information in the ERISP about conversations he later had with some of the men in the black car, and what they told him of things they did to the girl after he had gone. He strongly denied that there was anyone but him and Bilal Skaf in the car during the drive from the Bankstown Trotting Club to the industrial complex. He also denied that there was a pistol in the glove box of his car ("" If I had a pistol you would have found it today, mate""). 
     
      
       
      
    85 The third major piece of evidence tendered in the Crown case against Chami consisted of intercepted telephone conversations that he had with his friend Ghanem and a girl named Kyra during a luncheon recess that occurred during a break in his ERISP on 13 October 2000 and after all of the interview as summarised above had taken place. This evidence went to the jury as indicating Chami's consciousness of guilt, as it certainly did (see Ex C41). 
     
      
       
      
    86 Chami led evidence of good character through three character witnesses. 
     
      
       
        
       (b) Ghanem 
         
       
      
    87 The Crown case against Ghanem had two main arms.  
     
      
       
      
    88 The first was the complainant’s evidence, with her photoboard identification that remains the subject of dispute in the appeal.89 The second plank in the Crown case was the evidence of the two intercepted phone conversations between Chami and Ghanem that are referred to above in connection with the case against Chami. Their admissibility against Ghanem and the use made of them against him in the Crown address and in the judge's summing up to the jury are also raised as grounds of appeal on Ghanem's part. 
     
      
       
      
    90 There was phone contact between Chami and Ghanem early in the evening, before the assaults (908-9). Ghanem said in evidence that he had no recollection of the topic of his text message and mobile phone calls with Chami on the evening in question (Tr p1003). 
     
      
       
      
    91 Ghanem gave evidence at trial denying his involvement and raising an alibi. He said that he would have been working as an employed paver on 30 August 2000, but he had no recollection of where he would have been working that day. His usual finishing time was between 4pm and 4.30pm. This evidence was supported by the testimony of his employer, although the latter relied upon work records prepared by his wife rather than actual recollection (He had 40-45 employees split into 7 or 8 teams.) 
     
      
       
      
    92 As regards the phone call from his friend Chami during the break in the latter’s ERISP, Ghanem said in effect that he was merely lending a sympathetic ear to a friend in obvious trouble (Tr pp 981, 1017-8, 1020-1). 
     
      
       
        
       (c) Bilal Skaf 
       
      
    93 Bilal Skaf stood trial on 8 counts. There were two counts of aggravated indecent assault and one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, each relating to events when he was in the back seat of the red car as it was driven by Chami from Bankstown Trotting Club. There was the count of detaining for sexual advantage relating to the red car. There were two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent involving events in the back seat of the red car at the industrial estate (Counts 10 and 12). As indicated, the jury were unable to agree on a verdict in relation to Count 12. Bilal Skaf was also charged with perverting the course of justice (Counts 16 and 17) and he pleaded guilty to those counts in circumstances already referred to. 
     
      
       
      
    94 Bilal Skaf did not participate in a record of interview and he led no evidence at his trial. His defence, in effect, was that he had been wrongly identified by the complainant. 
     
      
       
      
    95 There were four major items of evidence in the Crown case. 
     
      
       
      
    96 The first was the evidence of the complainant, including the associated evidence relating to her photoboard identification of this accused. 
     
      
       
      
    97 Secondly, there was the evidence about Bilal Skaf's false statement to the police about him being at home all day that went the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt . 
     
      
       
      
    98 Thirdly, there was evidence that Bilal Skaf used his phone from the area of the Chullora industrial estate at the critical time (shortly after 9pm). 
     
      
       
      
    99 Fourthly, there were telephone intercepts of calls made by or to Bilal Skaf in October-November 2000 (Ex C42, C43). They reveal Bilal Skaf discussing with Mohammed Skaf and Tayyab Sheikh what the police should be told about Mohammed and Bilal Skaf’s movements on the day of the offence. At one stage Bilal Skaf tells Tayyab Sheikh “Don’t tell ‘em where I was, just watch what you say.” In a later conversation with a female, he says “[They can’t catch me] no way [they can catch me]” (the words in square brackets being spoken in Arabic). 
     
      
       
        
       (d) Mohammed Skaf 
       
      
    100 Mohammed Skaf stood trial on four counts. There were counts of detaining for sexual advantage and aggravated sexual intercourse without consent that related to events in the toilet at the Marion Street carpark. His defence was that the complainant consented to the sexual encounter that took place there. 
     
      
       
      
    101 There were two similar counts relating to the events at the industrial estate. The appellant said that he had been wrongly identified. 
     
      
       
      
    102 The major items of evidence in the Crown case against this accused were the evidence of the complainant; the evidence of consciousness of guilt evidenced by the false alibi relating to the go-cart visit to Canberra; and the mobile phone evidence. (Tr 424) 
     
      
       
      
    103 Mohammed Skaf did not give evidence. He relied on his ERISPs. 
     
      
       
      
    104 The complainant’s evidence that she was forced to have sex in the toilet drew support from her friend Leah’s corroboration about the coded message to “sis” about their sick mother and this appellant’s abusive interruption of the call when he snatched away the complainant’s mobile phone. The evidence of complaint to the friend and the doctor also supported the Crown case against Mohammed Skaf. 
     
      
       
      
    105 The complainant was cross-examined on the basis that she consented to sex in the Marion Street toilet. She was confronted with her first statement in which she said that she got off at Bankstown because her phone was taken from her on the train. Her second statement and her evidence was to the effect that she got off because of an arrangement to smoke marijuana and that her phone was taken by Mohammed Skaf at Bankstown. She explained the discrepancy on the basis of her distress and confusion in the early days after the repeated assaults. 
     
      
       
      
    106 It was put to her that she was wrong in saying that the man in the yellow jumper that assaulted her in the toilet also assaulted her at the industrial complex. The complainant adhered to her evidence that the same man was involved in both incidents. In doing so she referred to his yellow jumper and his face (Tr pp206-7).107 Particular issues raised about the complainant’s identification of Mohammed Skaf as the man involved in the assault at the industrial complex included her early statement that there was “USA” on the yellow jumper; the fact that she was emotionally and physically shattered by the time she got to industrial complex; and her evidence that the man in the yellow jumper at the industrial estate had said “suck my dick again” (Tr pp207-219, esp 218). 
     
      
       
      
    108 Vital pieces of corroborative evidence locating Mohammed Skaf at the industrial complex related to his operation of the complainant’s mobile phone there (using his SIM card), his returning the phone to her there and his making a call to the complainant while she was in the black car being driven from the industrial complex to Lidcombe station after the final assaults (see below). 
     
      
       
        
       Mobile phone evidence 
       
      
    109 There was a body of documentary and oral evidence tendered to show that phone calls or text messages were sent on the evening in question by the complainant, and by and between young men (including the appellants) involved that evening. Such evidence was also tendered to show the use that Mohammed Skaf made of the complainant’s phone that he took from her. See Ex C2, C23-C31, C35-36 and the evidence of the witnesses Porta, Walke, Dagg, Stark, Hayes and Simmons. 
     
      
       
      
    110 Each appellant had each other’s names and numbers stored in the memory of his own phone(s). The Skaf brothers also had the name and number of Tayyab Sheikh. Tayyab Sheikh had the names and numbers of Bilal and Mohammed Skaf as well as Ghanem. “H” had Mohammed Skaf, Tayyab Sheikh and the name and number of the complainant listed. 
     
      
       
      
    111 As indicated, the complainant said that Mohammed Skaf took her telephone shortly after their arrival at Bankstown Station. The SIM card from that phone was given back to her by H shortly after she got into the first black car at Bankstown. H had been seen to get it back from Mohammed Skaf. Mohammed Skaf’s SIM card was used in her phone from the Chullora industrial estate area until the phone itself was returned to her there shortly before she was released. On her evidence it was given back to her from the man she identified as Mohammed Skaf who had worn the yellow jumper. 
     
      
       
      
    112 The complainant’s evidence was firm that it was “the person with the yellow jumper [who] had returned” (Tr p88) and who committed further offences at the industrial estate. She said that he was the person who had assaulted her in the toilet and that she first met him on the train. She corroborated this by reference to hearing the ring tone of her own phone (“Real Slim Shady” by Eminem) when she was at that location (Tr p88) and by her evidence that the phone that Mohammed Skaf had taken from her at Bankstown was returned to her by him at the industrial estate. 
     
      
       
      
    113 Evidence from witnesses employed by Vodafone produced maps (Exx C30, C36 and C39) showing various sectors. Technical evidence was able to demonstrate that particular phone calls were made to and from persons using phones in particular sectors. 
     
      
       
      
    114 The critical sector evidence related to calls made or received within the Greenacre cell (2116), that included sectors 21163 and 21168.  
     
      
       
      
    115 Sector 21163 served calls made to or from the area that included Valentia Street, the home of Bilal and Mohammed Skaf. 
     
      
       
      
    116 Sector 21168 served calls made to or from the Chullora industrial complex. 
     
      
       
      
    117 This evidence produced the following information (quoting from the Crown’s amended summary of trial): 
     
      
       
        
         
         In respect of  
         0415 681 064 
          (the mobile of  
         Mohammed Skaf 
         ) 
         
        
        
         
         • Calls were made from within the  
         21163 sector 
          at 7:23pm (to Vodafone), 7:24pm and 7:44pm (to Bilal Skaf on 0414 076 468) and at 8:28pm (to Ali Skaf on 0415 889 122). 
         
        
        
         
         • Calls were made from within the  
         21168 sector 
          at 8:34pm (to Bilal Skaf on 0414 076 468), at 8:39pm and 8:40pm (to Vodafone) and at 9:03pm (to “H” on 0404 227 642). 
         
        
        
         
         • Calls were made from within the  
         21163 sector 
          at 10:04pm (to Ali Skaf on 0415 889 122), 11:06pm (to 0404 155 188) and at 11:11pm (to Tayyab Sheikh on 0415 681 052). 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence of Justin Stark was that there had been a change in the IMEI identification number for Mohammed Skaf’s SIM card from 7:23pm to 9:03pm on 30 August 2000 ( 
         exhibit C31 
         ). The IMEI number during this time (and only in this period) matched the number of the complainant’s mobile phone handset. This indicated that the SIM card from Mohammed Skaf’s mobile phone was placed into the complainant’s mobile phone handset for that period of time. Afterwards the IMEI number reverted to Mohammed Skaf’s mobile phone handset. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown relied on this evidence to show that Mohammed Skaf had not left after the incident in the toilet block in the Marion Street car park, as he had claimed to police in his final interview on 13 November 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         In respect of  
         0414 076 468

       Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    118 The following grounds of appeal were raised and pressed. 
     
      
       
        
        
       (a)  
       Chami 
        
       Ground 1: 
        The directions given by the learned judge on the standard of proof of the charges on the indictment were erroneous. 
        
        
       Ground 2: 
        The manner in which the learned trial judge directed the jury on the allegations made by the complainant against people who were not on trial was erroneous and likely to mislead the jury in their assessment of the general credibility of the complainant. 
        
        
       Ground 3: 
        The learned trial judge failed to define the elements of the third count on the indictment, that is the charge of unlawful detention brought pursuant to s90(A)  
       Crimes Act 
        (since repealed), and failed to identify for the jury the evidence relevant to the elements of that count insofar as it affected the appellant Mr Chami. 
        
        
       Ground 4: 
        The directions given by the learned trial judge on the elements of the offence charged against the appellant in respect of count 7 of the indictment were inadequate in the manner in which they dealt with the question of the appellant’s knowledge of the fact that the complainant was not consenting to sexual intercourse. 
        
        
       Ground 5: 
        The trial of the appellant miscarried when the learned Crown prosecutor made a comment on the failure of the appellant to give evidence. 
        
        
       Ground 6: 
        The directions given to the jury on the assessment of the reliability of the evidence given by the complainant were erroneous and inadequate. 
        
        
       Ground 7: 
        The manner in which the learned trial judge conducted the trial proceedings and the terms of his summing up, resulted in the jury’s deliberations being conducted in an atmosphere of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
        
        
       Ground 8: 
        The trial miscarried by reason of the Crown’s failure to disclose to the defence a statement of “H”. The trial judge erred in refusing to discharge the jury following upon counsel for the appellant learning of the existence of the statement. 
        
        
       (b)  
       Ghanem 
        
       Ground 1:  
       The trial judge erred in failing to exclude evidence of identification of the appellant from a photoboard. 
        
        
       Ground 2: 
        The trial judge erred in his directions in relation to the photoboard identification evidence. 
        
        
       Ground 3: 
        The trial judge erred in allowing telephone intercept evidence to be admitted as evidence against the appellant. 
        
        
       Ground 4: 
        The trial judge erred in his directions on the telephone intercept evidence. 
        
        
       Ground 5: 
        The trial judge erred in refusing an application seeking a separate trial for the appellant. 
        
        
       Ground 6: 
        The trial judge erred in his directions on the standard of proof. 
        
        
       Ground 7:  
       The trial miscarried by reason of the Crown’s failure to disclose to the defence a statement of “H”. The trial judge erred in refusing to discharge the jury following upon counsel for the appellant learning of the existence of this statement. 
        
        
       (c)  
       Bilal Skaf 
        
       Ground 1: 
        The verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence. 
        
        
       Ground 3: 
        His Honour erred in leaving the appellant’s lies to the jury as evidence of consciousness of guilt. 
        
        
       Ground 4: 
        The trial miscarried because of the learned trial judge’s directions as to lies, and in particular the failure of the learned trial judge to indicate other reasons for telling a lie apart from consciousness of guilt. 
        
        
       Ground 6: 
        The trial judge erred in his directions on the standard of proof. 
        
        
       (d)  
       Mohammed Skaf 
        
       Ground 2: 
        The directions given by the learned trial judge on the standard of proof of the charges in the indictment were erroneous. 
        
        
       Ground 3: 
        The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury in relation to the significance of allegations made by the complainant with respect to other alleged offenders. 
        
        
       Ground 4: 
        The trial judge erred in failing to identify the evidence of the complainant admissible against the appellant Mohammed Skaf and the counts in respect of which it was admissible. 
        
        
       Ground 5: 
        A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the Crown’s address to the jury in relation to the warning they were to be given by the trial judge in relation to identification evidence which had the effect of undermining that warning. 
        
        
       Ground 6: 
        The trial judge erred in failing to give adequate warnings in relation to identification evidence. 
        
        
       Ground 7: 
        The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the need to scrutinize the complainant’s evidence with great care before returning a verdict of guilty in accordance with  
       R v Murray 
        (1987) 11 NSWLR 12. 
        
        
       Ground 8: 
        The trial judge erred in failing to give adequate directions to the jury in relation to lies told by the appellant. 
        
        
       Ground 9: 
        A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the trial judge’s directions which undermined the address of the appellant’s counsel and unfairly prejudiced the appellant. 
        
        
       Ground 10: 
        There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of a lack of balance in the trial judge’s directions to the jury. 
        
        
       Refusal to order separate trial (Ghanem 5) 
       
      
    119 Ghanem’s application for a separate trial was refused on 8 March 2002. It had been made on the basis of a weak case against the particular accused; prejudice stemming particularly from the pervert course of justice charges against Bilal Skaf; Ghanem’s non-involvement in other attacks about which evidence would be given; and prejudice that would occur if any co-accused gave evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    120 Judge Finnane held that the three series of attacks on the complainant were linked in that they occurred one after the other with the same victim seemingly being handed over from one group to the next. He considered the weight of evidence against Ghanem as compared to that implicating the other accused. He held that the identification evidence seemed to be quite clear and that the strength of the case against Ghanem was not affected by that implicating others. He was of the opinion that there was no evidence that was highly prejudicial to Ghanem although inadmissible against him. In forming this view, he observed that the material suggesting perversion of the course of justice by the Skaf brothers reflected only on those who were part of it. Other factors taken into account were concern that quite a false picture would be created if the complainant did not give evidence of all of the events that occurred; the expense and inconvenience that would be caused in bringing large numbers of witnesses to more than one trial; and the interests of the complainant.121 Ghanem accepts that the issue to be determined in this Court is whether the trial miscarried because it was unfair to have a joint trial in all the circumstances (see generally Verma (1987) 30 A Crim R 441). 
     
      
       
      
    122 In our view the trial involving Ghanem did not miscarry on this ground. The interests of justice made it appropriate for there to be a joint trial. As it turned out, the complainant’s credibility was tested on particular issues as she gave her account of a related stream of events. For example, the circumstances of one contested identification were available to be compared with another identification that was in dispute. The complainant’s account of who was present at various stages of the horrific evening, particularly stages where one of the accused was directly involved, had to be given and would have been tested in any event. 
     
      
       
      
    123 Proper directions were given as to the need to consider the cases separately. 
     
      
       
      
    124 It also turned out that Ghanem was the only accused to give evidence at the trial. And (for what it was worth) Chami’s ERISP (which went into evidence in his case alone) asserted that Ghanem was not present. 
     
      
       
      
    125 In our view this ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Belated disclosure of H’s statement (Chami 8, Ghanem 7) 
       
      
    126 Early on the morning of Thursday 23 May 2002 the defence parties were provided with a previously unserved statement of H. It was dated 14 September 2000 and it provided H's version of events involving the complainant. The Crown had closed its case the previous day. 
     
      
       
      
    127 Counsel for Chami (Ms Francis) sought an adjournment to consider what to do. After discussion the matter was stood down until midday for preliminary inquiries to be made. Upon resumption, Ms Francis applied for a further adjournment to investigate certain matters revealed by the Crown in the interim relevant to the credibility of the material in H's statement. Counsel for Ghanem (Ms Langley) sought the discharge of the jury, alternatively for leave to cross examine the complainant further. 
     
      
       
      
    128 The matter of concern was H's assertion that he was present when the complainant had been picked up from the Marion Street car park after the first set of assaults and driven by two men in a ""red Mazda two door"" to ""some markets in a carpark"". The significance in relation to Chami's and Ghanem's cases was that the complainant had in her first statement to the police described a number of assaults, including the production of the gun, as having occurred in the “red…hatchback with two doors” in which she had been driven from the Marion St carpark to the Bankstown Trotting Club. In her second statement and in her evidence, the complainant said that she was mistaken in her first statement and that it was a black two door hatchback in which she had been driven from Marion Street to the Bankstown Trotting Club. She also said that the gun was produced in the later red car, not the black car. The red car had four doors and offences involving the appellants Chami, Ghanem and Bilal Skaf were said to have occurred in it. 
     
      
       
      
    129 Judge Finnane agreed to adjourn the trial until the following Monday, explaining why he was not disposed to discharge the jury and why a limited adjournment was adequate to ensure a fair trial (Tr pp942-4). It was indicated that the defence would have the opportunity of further cross-examining the complainant and of issuing subpoenas, notwithstanding his Honour's concerns about a fishing expedition. 
     
      
       
      
    130 Before the hearing was adjourned, the Crown recalled Detective Sergeant Porta on the voir dire to give evidence about police investigations responsive to the matters raised by H in his statement. The officer was cross examined by Ms Francis and Ms Langley. 
     
      
       
      
    131 When the trial resumed the following Monday, Detective Sergeant Porta gave further evidence in the absence of the jury and he produced the documents that had previously been called for by the representatives of the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    132 Ms Francis then sought the discharge of the jury on the basis of inadequate Crown disclosure that had affected the fairness of the trial in respect of Chami. Counsel indicated that she did not wish to have the complainant recalled. Ms Langley also sought a discharge on behalf of Ghanem, indicating a similar attitude as regards the opportunity for further cross-examination of the complainant. 
     
      
       
      
    133 The applications to discharge the jury were refused. This ruling is the subject of these grounds of appeal by Chami and Ghanem. 
     
      
       
      
    134 To understand the issues it is necessary to consider the material in the complainant’s first statement, the material in H's statement, the arguments advanced at trial and pressed on appeal as to the nature of the prejudice occasioned to the accused, the material established by and during the course of Detective Sergeant Porta's voir dire evidence and the reasons given for the refusal of the application. 
     
      
       
      
    135 In her first statement to the police the complainant had said that she was driven away from the Marion Street car park in a “grungy” red hatchback with two doors. She made several corrections in her second statement. One of them was to assert that it was a black car that drove her from the Marion Street car park to the Bankstown Trotting Club car park. Her second statement and trial testimony were also to the effect that the red car in which several sexual assaults occurred and the gun was produced had four doors. There was a lot of cross-examination about discrepancies and confusion concerning the red and black cars and the description of the driver of the red car (Tr pp 260, 267, 268, 277, 278, 281). 
     
      
       
      
    136 H's statement was exculpatory of any criminal conduct. It was thus at variance with his own plea of guilty which had earlier been accepted by the judge, to the knowledge of the present appellants. The Crown prosecutor was not challenged as to her decision not to call H as a Crown witness, having regard to his unreliability. Nor was it disputed that evidence had been provided to his Honour in sentencing proceedings that indicated that H suffered from intellectual disability. H's statement contained nothing that directly assisted the cases of the two accused. Its belated production was not said to have been deliberate. 
     
      
       
      
    137 Counsel for Chami submitted to the trial judge and in this Court that H had raised the possibility of a second red car (described by H as a “real shit box”) different from the four-door red Pulsar owned by Chami in which sexual intercourse involving Chami admittedly took place. The argument was that the possibility of there being two red cars opened the way for Chami to distance himself from the complainant's evidence that the driver of the red car took a gun out of the glove box and brandished it. (The production of the gun was part of the evidence supporting the detain for advantage charge based upon several events in (Chami’s) red car.) 
     
      
       
      
    138 Counsel for Ghanem took a different position, both at trial and in this Court. H's statement was said to have revived the possibility that the complainant was correct the first time when she said that she was taken from the Marion Street carpark in a two door red hatchback. It was true that Ghanem was not alleged at any time (not even by H) to have been a passenger in the first car, and that it was at all times alleged that he arrived at the Trotting Club in the red car driven by Chami. Nevertheless, it was argued that the new material in H's statement could have been used as a basis of challenging the complainant's general credibility. 
     
      
       
      
    139 As indicated, counsel for neither accused took up the offered opportunity for further cross-examination of the complainant. That offer was made by the Crown prosecutor. The judge had his doubts, but the matter never arose for decision in light of the position taken by the two accused. Ms Langley argued that it would do injustice to her client’s case to be required to retrace her steps in light of the material in the belatedly-produced statement.140 Detective Sergeant Porta gave evidence and produced records referable to police investigations of H's claim that a “real shit box” two door red Mazda driven by a mate called Khalid or Ahmed who went to Condell Park High School gave the complainant a lift, stopping at McDonalds Bankstown. Investigations at the High School disclosed that Ahmed and Khalid were common names. No red “two door shit box” was seen at the school, which was checked over a number of days (Tr pp 949-950). There was no video surveillance tape made and/or retained at any of the public places at which the vehicle stopped en route. 
     
      
       
      
    141 The officer’s evidence showed that the information provided by H (for what it was worth) was investigated and had produced nothing of relevance.  
     
      
       
      
    142 In the upshot, the accused were given the period between Thursday and Monday to make further inquiries of their own. It is very difficult to conceive what inquiries could have been done that were not available to be done in the time permitted. The trail was obviously very cold. 
     
      
       
      
    143 In his reasons of 27 May 2002 refusing a discharge Judge Finnane referred to the fact that H had pleaded guilty to offences against the present complainant as well as offences against other persons. He was developmentally delayed. His Honour then analysed the material in H's statement, including what he said about the red car. The judge observed that most of the statement was completely false in light of H’s plea of guilty. Reference was made to the extensive cross-examination of the complainant earlier in the trial about the changes from her first statement of 1 September to her second statement of 21 September following discussion with Senior Constable Brazel on 14 September. The judge noted that it had been put to the complainant a number of times that the assaults involving Chami and later Ghanem might have taken place in a black vehicle, and that the complainant had denied this and said that they occurred in Chami's red car. The judge then referred to the evidence of Sergeant Porta about the ultimately fruitless attempts to establish the existence of the red vehicle referred to in H's statement. He concluded that the nonproduction of this information could not materially have affected the credibility of the complainant. He continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
         In my opinion this material could not be said to have any relevance or any worth. The material is contained in a false statement by a person who has pleaded guilty. It could not be put as a matter of fact by either counsel who might wish to rely on it, and calling him would not establish it as a fact because he has pleaded guilty since he made the statement. 
         
        
        
         
         In my opinion this statement is no more relevant than the supposition that anybody might come up with that there may have been another car or cars around the place at some time, notwithstanding the evidence that there was not. The fact that Mr [H], in a false statement, claims that there was a car driven by mysterious persons who cannot be really identified, nor can the car, does not, in my opinion, raise any fact of any significance or relevance or bearing upon this case. 
         
        
        
         
         I am unable to agree that any forensic advantage has been lost and I am unable to agree in any way that there has been an unfair trial because this material was not produced. In my opinion the police have no obligation, nor has the Crown, to produce every statement made by someone, even a co-accused, in a case such as this, particularly where it is obvious that what is said is false. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    144 The judge referred to the remarks of King CJ in an unreported South Australian case (R v K (1991) 161 LSJS 135 at 140, cited in R v Lewis-Hamilton (1997) 92 A Crim R 532 at 537) relevant to the Crown's duty of disclosure. The Chief Justice had said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         This obligation  
         [of disclosure] 
          must in principle extend… to any information in the possession of the prosecution which reflects materially upon the credibility of prosecution witnesses. There must be limits, however, to the type of information which must be disclosed. It cannot be that the prosecution is required to disclose every speculative and scurrilous rumour which may have come to the ears of investigating officers concerning a witness. The obligation arises … only if the information is sufficiently solid to cause reasonable persons conducting the prosecution to think that cross-examination based upon it might elicit answers materially affecting the credibility of the witness. 
         
        
        
         
           
         
        
       
      
    145 These two appellants submit that the judge was wrong to have regarded H's statement as having no relevance or materiality. We are inclined to agree and are troubled by the categorical terms of His Honour's remarks. But those remarks fall into somewhat clearer focus when it is recognised that the question at issue was the impact of the material in H's statement upon the complainant's credibility.  
     
      
       
      
    146 There was no question of calling H as a witness at trial. The prosecutor's decision not to rely upon H's testimony had not been questioned and it remained open to any defendant to call H as his witness. The reality was that no one wanted him at the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    147 H’s statement opened up the possibility that a second red car driven by two of his mates was present at Bankstown early in the evening. The complainant got into the car, but no offences occurred in it, according to H. The police had followed this lead and got nowhere. The trail was very cold by the time of the trial, and the prospect that it might produce something of assistance to the defence remained speculative to the point of nonexistence.  
     
      
       
      
    148 The whole burden of the application for discharge rested upon the loss of opportunity to have used the information in H's statement in the earlier cross-examination of the complainant. The Crown prosecutor was willing to recall the complainant if necessary, but this offer was not taken up. Instead, it was argued that some material advantage had been lost earlier in the trial when the cross-examination had been framed on the basis of a defence case that had not had access to H's statement.  
     
      
       
      
    149 The suggestion that defence counsel were led down some path resulting in a miscarriage is however speculation without foundation. The principles of the Queen's Case ((1820) 2 Brod & Bing 284, 129 ER 976) as reformulated in s44 of the Evidence Act meant that the manner in which the complainant could have been confronted with the statement was severely constrained. So severely, that it was highly unlikely that defence counsel would ever have taken the risk of bringing H into the picture or putting his statement before the complainant. The opportunity to put a two red car hypothesis before the complainant by way of further cross-examination was one that counsel decided not to take up.  
     
      
       
      
    150 We do not agree that the judge erred in his refusal to discharge the jury. We agree with the main thrust of his remarks which were directed at the conclusion that no forensic advantage had been lost such as to have caused the trial to miscarry at that stage. 
     
      
       
      
    151 These grounds fail. 
     
      
       
        
       Wrongful admission of Ghanem’s photoboard identification (Ghanem 1) 
        
       
      
    152 The complainant did not mention a person with a ponytail in her first statement made on 1 September 2000. 
     
      
       
      
    153 On 14 September 2000 the complainant had a conversation with Senior Constable Brazel. The officer’s record of the description of the passenger in the red car was (Tr p551) “long hair in ponytail, wavy hair, brown, blond, Leb. 18 years, medium build, Hawaiian shirt with cargo pants”. 
     
      
       
      
    154 The next description given by the complainant was in her statement of 21 September 2000 (Tr p303): 
     
      
       
        
         
         … male, of Lebanese appearance. He was aged about 18 years, he wore his hair in a ponytail, his hair was slightly curly on the ends. He was medium build wearing an Hawaiian shirt and bone coloured cargo pants. 
         
        
        
       
      
    155 On 15 November 2000 the complainant identified Ghanem from a photoboard comprising 15 photographs (Ex C6). He is not the only young man with longish hair, but his was the only photograph depicting a man with obviously long hair which was blondish and curly on the ends. (When the police had attended Ghanem’s home he took his hair out of a ponytail before he was photographed with it hanging loose.) 
     
      
       
      
    156 In her evidence in chief the complainant described the front passenger of the red car (Ghanem, on the Crown case) in the following terms (Tr p83): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. Now you mentioned the passenger, and I don’t think I have asked you, what did the passenger look like? 
          
         A. Well, what I remembered about him, he was actually good looking. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. This is the front seat passenger of the red car? 
          
         A. Yes. I remember thinking why did he feel the need to do this to me when he could have found any girl to do it with him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Because he was attractive? 
          
         A. That’s what struck me. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What did he look like? 
          
         A. He had - I remember his hair, it was blondish at the ends, he had it long, like an undercut sort of, and he was wearing, had it in a pony-tail, and I remember him wearing a Hawaiian kind of shirt and a pair of bone cargo pants. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How long was his hair; did you notice? 
          
         A. When it was tied up it was just past the nape of his neck. It was fairly long for a guy, I remember. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. Was it curly or straight or -- 
          
         A. It was curly at the ends. It was pulled back really tight, so the top was really straight, but it was curly at the ends. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see his face well, or not? 
          
         A. Yes. While he was doing that assault upon me I remember looking at his face a few times, because it was only inches away from mine, so I did get quite a few good looks at his face. It was one of the faces that stuck in my mind the most after that night. 
         
        
        
       See also Tr pp293, 315, 359-60, 440 for further evidence of the complainant on this issue. 
        
       
      
    157 The complainant agreed in cross-examination that the hair was what stood out most of all in her mind in her identification of Ghanem. But she adhered to her evidence about other features, including his deep set eyes and the fact that he was “somewhat better looking”. 
     
      
       
      
    158 The police search of Ghanem’s home revealed no Hawaiian shirt or bone coloured cargo pants. In his evidence denying any involvement in the sexual assault of the complainant, Ghanem said that he did not own any such clothing. 
     
      
       
      
    159 The submission on appeal is that the photoboard identification was unfairly prejudicial and ought to have been excluded. It’s admission at trial had been objected to on this basis (Tr pp361-70). The point being made was that, of the 15 photos in the particular photoboard, there was only one person who fitted the description then previously given as to the passenger in the red car. 
     
      
       
      
    160 One difficulty with this submission is that it would confine the relevant array to the particular photoboard containing Ghanem’s picture. But this was not a case where the complainant was asked to look at a particular photoboard to see if she could identify a particular person. The complainant viewed five photoboards over three separate visits, sometimes identifying one or more of the young men pictured. 
     
      
       
      
    161 In brief reasons given on 7 May 2002 Judge Finnane ruled that the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial and he refused to exclude it. He held that all the men depicted in Ex C6 appear to have been roughly in the same age group and could be said to have a Middle Eastern or Lebanese appearance. All had different facial characteristics. Apart from Ghanem, there were ten persons whose hair could be said to be long enough to wear in a ponytail. None of the persons in the photographs were shown to be wearing ponytails, including Ghanem. His Honour then recounted the various statements given by the complainant describing the passenger in the red car (with the exception of the statement made to Senior Constable Brazel, which had not at that stage been elicited in evidence). 
     
      
       
      
    162 After referring to s137 of the Evidence Act his Honour focussed on the submission that showing the photoboards to the witness had created unfair prejudice to the accused because he was so different from others pictured in it. He observed that the complainant’s identification of the accused was not confined to selecting the photo. There was a video showing how she came to pick the particular photo and there was nothing to suggest that she had been prompted in any way to select a particular photo. She and others gave evidence about the whole identification process. 
     
      
       
      
    163 His Honour observed (correctly) that the test in question was not whether the evidence was prejudicial but whether it was unfairly prejudicial. On that test, he refused to exclude the evidence. He observed that the photoboard evidence had been supplemented by other evidence that would have to be assessed by the jury in light of directions given to them. 
     
      
       
      
    164 We have looked at Ex C6. There is no reason to disagree with Judge Finnane’s factual conclusions in relation to the various photographs depicted in it. Nor do we detect any error in the trial judge’s approach to the balancing task with which he was confronted on this particular issue. 
     
      
       
      
    165 The Crown accepts that Ghanem’s hair in the photograph is lighter than that of any of the other young men pictured in Ex C6, but submits that it is not significantly lighter. We agree that it is not significantly lighter than the hair of the men in pictures 3 and 5. In any event, the colour of the hair was not a significant aspect of the identification process. 
     
      
       
      
    166 The case is far removed from Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 upon which the appellant placed some reliance. There the photoboard showed only one man with a goatee beard and that had been the sole identifying factor in the witness’ mind. 
     
      
       
      
    167 Ghanem does not suggest any misconduct on the part of the police in compiling the particular photoboard that became Ex C6. The police had to work within the confines of the complainant’s description of the various suspects. Naturally, there had to be a bona fide and reasonable attempt to provide a fair array. None of the accused had agreed to a line up. 
     
      
       
      
    168 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Wrongful admission of Ghanem’s telephone intercept evidence (Ghanem 3) 
        
       
      
    169 Chami was interviewed by the police on 13 October 2000. When the interview was largely complete Chami was permitted to leave the police station. During this break he made four telephone calls which were intercepted and recorded. Two were calls to Ghanem. 
     
      
       
      
    170 Some of Chami’s statements were clearly incriminatory of himself. The present ground of appeal concerns whether they were properly left to the jury on the basis of being incriminatory of Ghanem. 
     
      
       
      
    171 The transcript of the calls is Ex C41. It reveals a conversation between two friends one of whom (Chami) is very concerned that he is about to be charged with serious offences involving the present complainant. In Chami’s words, “Ghanem, they’ve fucked me, brother”. The two men made arrangements to meet urgently at the Bankstown library. 
     
      
       
      
    172 Ghanem’s responses were consistent with concern for a friend who had got himself into trouble with the police, but the real issue is whether they revealed more. In his evidence, Ghanem confirmed that he had been a friend of Chami since kindergarten, that he had heard that police visited Chami’s home and that he was concerned to comfort a friend who was upset as a result of his interview with the police (Tr pp979-81, 1017-8, 1020). He said in effect that he had no other purpose: if he was worried, it was worry about his friend. 
     
      
       
      
    173 The prosecution sought to adduce the telephone calls as evidence of consciousness of guilt against both Chami and Ghanem. At trial Ghanem’s counsel objected on the grounds of relevance and invoked ss135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
       
      
    174 One portion of the conversation was: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Chami: [They know your name] I’ve seen Bill’s name, everyone’s name [They know everything] bro 
         
        
        
         
         Ghanem: So what’s gunna happen? 
         
        
        
         
         Chami: …I’m at the cop shop. 
         
        
        
       
      
    175 Judge Finnane ruled that the evidence was admissible to show consciousness of guilt on the part of Chami. But in relation to Ghanem, his Honour ruled that it could not be used for this purpose. Nevertheless, the evidence was available to show “close association” or “deep interest in what Mr Chami is talking about or had talked about” or “an association between two people having an interest in the matter which is the subject of the trial” (Reasons 16 May 2002 pp9-10). 
     
      
       
      
    176 Ghanem submits that the evidence should not have been admitted against him on this or any other basis. The ruling was tantamount to an endorsement of guilt by association. In the jury’s mind, the distinction between consciousness of guilt and “an association between two people having an interest in the matter which is the subject of the trial” would be a distinction without a difference. The friendship between the two men had already been established and it was not in dispute. There could be nothing wrong in a person receiving a phone call from a friend and listening as the latter poured forth a matter of genuine concern to himself. 
     
      
       
      
    177 This appellant’s submissions should be accepted. Chami’s paramount purpose was concern for himself. Ghanem gave him a sympathetic ear, but did not adopt Chami’s inculpatory statements or otherwise implicate himself. The evidence was therefore not relevant to any case against Ghanem. It was certainly unfairly prejudicial to a degree that outweighed any probative force.  
     
      
       
      
    178 This situation is analogous to that of a person who visits a friend in gaol. It would be wrong to infer from this alone that the association was improper (cf Kawicki (1995) 82 A Crim R 191 at 194-5). 
     
      
       
      
    179 The Crown points out that the evidence was admitted before it was known whether Ghanem would give evidence. This does not really assist in resolving the issue of prejudice. In opposing the introduction of this material Ghanem’s counsel had offered to admit that he and Chami had gone to school together. There was already evidence about mobile phone discussions early in the evening in question and the fact that each man had the other’s number coded into his own phone. It follows that this Crown submission does not answer the issues of unfair prejudice or misuse of the material. 
     
      
       
      
    180 The risk of prejudice was not countered by warnings from the judge as to the inappropriate use of this material, the issue to which we turn immediately. 
     
      
       
      
    181 This ground is upheld. 
     
      
       
      
    182 We have found it unnecessary to consider the separate submission that any incriminatory tone or aspect of the Chami-Ghanem conversation (and of the cross-examination of Ghanem based on this evidence) may have been due to the fact that the focus of the conversation was a problem feared in relation to a different sexual assault then under police investigation. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions on telephone intercept evidence (Ghanem 4) 
        
       
      
    183 Despite the ruling that the telephone intercept evidence could not be used to show any consciousness of guilt by Ghanem, the Crown prosecutor addressed the jury in the following terms (Tr pp1121-2): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Of course in the break after [Chami] had admitted to having sex with her … there is this frantic call to Mohammed Ghanem. And, ladies and gentlemen, the Crown would submit to you that if … two good mates have together committed something of which they are not proud or something of a criminal nature and one is interviewed by police and makes certain admissions consistent with the crime, the very first person he is going to call is the person who was with him, his mate who was with him, and he rings Ghanem and he says “Ghanem, they've fucked me brother”. 
         
        
        
         
         Listen to it again. “What happened? Where are you?' “I'm at... everyone's name 
          [sic].  
         They know everything.” 
           
         Ghanem doesn't say they know everything about what? He says, “So what’s gunna happen”, and he goes straight down there on the double. And the arrangement of course is Chami doesn't have to tell Ghanem what happened, Ghanem knows, and obviously the conversation once he arrives is to get the heads together to make sure what is said is the same thing. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    184 Ghanem correctly observes that this last sentence misrepresented the text of the intercepted conversation. He also submits that these comments made it even more important that the jury be directed against using the telephone intercept evidence to infer consciousness of guilt. No such directions were given. 
     
      
       
      
    185 In the written summary of facts the trial judge merely noted that the telephone intercept evidence was available against Ghanem. In the summing up itself the jury were told (SU138-9): 
     
      
       
        
         
         But the Crown case is that clearly here is Mr Chami, in the middle of an interview, ringing up Mr Ghanem to tell him they're both in trouble, the police are on to both of them and they had better get together at the library and have a chat about it.  
         
        
        
         
         And it turned out to be an inspired piece of prophecy, because indeed the police did speak to Mr Ghanem, and Mr Ghanem is here in court facing these charges. 
         
        
        
         
         On the Crown case the conversations are significant because they show two people, intimately connected with the events of this night, anxiously discussing what had occurred in the interview of one of them. Why would they discuss it? Because they had that common interest. 
         
        
        
         
         It is put on behalf of Mr Chami, and indeed on behalf of Mr Ghanem, that this was just a call between two friends; Mr Chami was merely passing on to his friend the fact that the police were going to charge him, he thought, with attempted murder; and it wasn’t because they were implicated in anything, it was just because they were two friends, and it’s the sort of discussion you would have between two friends. 
         
        
        
       
      
    186 Ghanem submits that these directions contradicted the limited basis upon which the telephone intercept evidence had been admitted against him; and they left the jury without any warning against using Chami's own inculpatory statements to attribute a consciousness of guilt on the part of Ghanem. 
     
      
       
      
    187 The Crown submits that the directions at SU138-9 set out above put the competing inferences that had been relied upon in the addresses of counsel. 
     
      
       
      
    188 In our view the directions exacerbated the situation created by the admission of the evidence against Ghanem. They also tended to concentrate on Chami’s perspective, without adverting to the hypothesis (supported by Ghanem’s evidence) that Ghanem was doing no more than giving his friend in trouble a sympathetic ear. Ghanem had not adopted anything said by Chami. This should have been put with emphasis and the jury should have been warned against using the information against him as indicating consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
       
      
    189 Notwithstanding rule 4 (which the Crown invokes) we would uphold this ground of appeal, especially since it is linked with Ghanem’s third ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    190 Ghanem is entitled to a new trial. 
     
      
       
        
       Prosecutor’s comment on Chami’s failure to give evidence (Chami 5) 
        
       
      
    191 Chami’s sister-in-law gave character evidence in the trial. She was cross-examined about other issues, including the nature of the relationship between Chami and a young woman, Kyra. Chami had spoken to Kyra in an intercepted telephone call shortly after a lengthy and damaging ERISP on 13 October 2000, effectively coaching her as to the terms of a false alibi she should provide the police. 
     
      
       
      
    192 The cross-examination as to the length of the relationship included the following (Tr p1066, emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. When do you say the relationship with Kyra started? 
          
         A. I don’t know the exact date or month. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You said two years? 
          
         A. It’s been a couple of times. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It’s 2002 now, May something or other? 
          
         A. I don’t know which month he met Kyra, it could have been a week before or a week after I don’t know the exact date. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Two years. May 2000 right, so was it before then or after that? 
          
         A. Could be under two years.  
         Have you asked Mahmoud this question? 
         
        
        
         
         Q.  
         No and I don’t believe I will have the opportunity to do that so you tell me -- 
          
         A. -- I don’t know what day he met her. I know it’s a couple of years. 
         
        
        
       
      
    193 An application to discharge the jury was refused. 
     
      
       
      
    194 Section 20(2) of the Evidence Act relevantly prohibits a prosecutor from commenting on the failure of a defendant to give evidence in criminal proceedings. 
     
      
       
      
    195 The Crown prosecutor’s statement was made at a time after the jury had become aware that Chami would not be called as a witness. 
     
      
       
      
    196 In rejecting an application to discharge the jury, Judge Finnane held that the Crown prosecutor’s comment (“I won’t have the opportunity”):  
     
      
       
        
         
         … was a factual statement, as Ms Francis had indicated that she did not intend to call the accused. If the accused is not called, counsel present cannot cross-examine. That is our system of law. This was not a comment by the Prosecution on the failure of the accused to give evidence. It was a comment arising from the consequence that flows from the accused not giving evidence, namely, that she cannot cross-examine him. 
         
        
        
       
      
    197 The cross-examiner’s comment was unnecessary and unfortunate, but it did not infringe s20(2).  
     
      
       
      
    198 A contravention arises when the prosecutor refers to the fact that the accused has the right to give evidence but fails to give evidence. The question must depend on the words used and the circumstances in which they are used. As Higgins J said in Bataillard v The King (1907) 4 CLR 1282 at 1292: “the comment must be on the refraining – on the fact that he could have given evidence on oath and has not done so”. See also Peterson v The Queen (1979) 41 FLR 205. In our view, the prosecutor’s remarks did not go this far. 
     
      
       
      
    199 Appropriate instructions were later given to the jury regarding Chami’s failure to give evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    200 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Prosecutor’s address re warning (Mohammed Skaf Ground 5) 
       
      
    201 As indicated, the issue in relation to Counts 14 and 15 against Mohammed Skaf was that of identification. 
     
      
       
      
    202 The Crown prosecutor did not confine herself to addressing on the facts. The transcript of her address discloses that she ventured proleptically into the judge’s domain. She said (Tr pp1106-7, emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Ladies and gentlemen, identification in the law is an interesting concept, and his Honour will give you many and detailed directions about identification and about how closely you have to examine and scrutinise identification evidence, and the law says,  
         the higher courts and the precedents in law tell us and oblige trial judges to give many warnings about identification. And, of course, many of those cases in which those warnings have been set down have involved cases where people get just fleeting looks at people who have committed a crime. 
          You might imagine say a bank robbery, if a person sees someone running out fast they get a bit of a look and they might think that they can identify someone, but you would have to look at that fairly closely because they don’t expect they are going to see a robber coming out, they just get a fleeting glance perhaps from the side, they have no real interest in the money the bank has lost, for example, and so they may not be in such a position as [Ms D] was.  
         
        
        
         
         [Ms D] identifies people who have actually had sexual intercourse with her and had their faces this close to her, right up close to her. She identifies people who she has known when things appear to be quite hopeful and she has seen them as things deteriorate into something disastrous for her. She saw them over a significant period of time, it was not just a fleeting glance as someone you might see running out of a shop or running away from a common assault in the street. She had got to know these people. She had spoken to them, she had put her trust in them, and in these cases she had seen them driving through streets, stopped at petrol stations, stopped at townhouses, and she had seen them there right up at close range having sexual intercourse with her. 
         
        
        
         
         So of course you must observe and listen to his Honour’s directions that he is required to give you, and in this and every identification case, because this is a special case you might think ladies and gentleman, this is a case where she has identified people she has spent a significant time with in various types of circumstances, including being so close as to be having sexual intercourse with them, and you might think the faces of those men, the men she identified and described so well, were galvanised upon her memory in the circumstances that she described. 
         
        
        
       
      
    203 Mohammed Skaf’s complaint on appeal is that counsel was effectively watering down the warning that would later be given by the trial judge, particularly by the reference to “higher courts and precedents”. 
     
      
       
      
    204 This ground has no merit. 
     
      
       
      
    205 There is no reason for thinking that the jury would have been deflected from their task. Counsel for the accused addressed later. And later still came the summing up in which the jury were given directions on the law and facts. 
     
      
       
      
    206 The Crown prosecutor was perfectly entitled to develop the argument that the complainant had significant opportunities to become familiar with Mohammed Skaf’s face and features. 
     
      
       
      
    207 It is also significant that the jury were sent out very shortly after the portion of the prosecutor’s address set out above. Counsel for two of the accused raised objections to recent remarks of the prosecutor, but no one raised the issue complained of in this ground of appeal. Rule 4 applies. 
     
      
       
      
    208 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
      
    209 It is convenient now to address the remaining complaints about the directions in the summing up. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions on standard of proof (Chami 1, Ghanem 6, Bilal Skaf 6, Mohammed Skaf 2) 
        
       
      
    210 The written Directions of Law given to the jury said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Proof beyond reasonable doubt 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown must prove each of the elements of each charge in the case against each of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The expression “beyond reasonable doubt” means what it says. It is the highest level of proof in our system of law. Each of you as jurors knows the meaning of this expression. 
         
        
        
       
      
    211 Early in his summing up the judge directed the jury as follows (SU 14-16, emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Please remember each of you has to exercise your own judgment. No-one is entitled to bully you. No-one should make fun of you. You all have opinions that are equally important. All of you are entitled to express them and have them considered. When you come to decide something you can all have different  
         reasons 
          for deciding something. One of you may decide a particular witness is impressive because of one particular  
         reason 
         . The other may think that a witness gave very forthright evidence and I like that style. Another might say: Well, I thought that witness was telling the truth and have another  
         reason 
          for it altogether. When this witness said this and that that made sense, they are telling the truth. You can get two people coming to the same view, but approaching it in different ways. You do not all look at it in the same way. 
         
        
        
         
         In fact I will give you a document of what the elements of the particular offences are. What you have to be satisfied about beyond reasonable doubt is the actual ingredients of each offence. You do not have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that every word [Ms D] said was true for example. What you have to be satisfied is, having heard all the evidence, you have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, that this particular charge is made out. You may have a doubt about some parts of this evidence or that evidence and yet still be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, you may not be able to come to a conclusion that you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt. If you have a doubt  
         and it is based on reason 
          then you should give the benefit of that doubt to the accused person in whose case you are considering. 
         
        
        
         
         “Beyond reasonable doubt” is an expression meaning what it says. It is the highest form of proof known to the law. It does not mean “beyond reasonable doubt to the point of certainty”. It means “beyond reasonable doubt” it means what it says. “Beyond reasonable doubt”,  
         any doubt that is in fact reasonable 
         . 
         
        
        
       
      
    212 The appellants submit that these directions were erroneous as regards the bolded portions. Although no counsel took objection at trial, it is now submitted that the errors were fundamental and that a miscarriage ensued. 
     
      
       
      
    213 The Crown invokes rule 4. 
     
      
       
      
    214 No affidavit of trial counsel has been filed that might cast any light on the collective failure to raise any protest at trial. 
     
      
       
      
    215 There were many unexceptional references throughout the summing up as to the Crown’s onus and standard of proof. 
     
      
       
      
    216 Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28 is the reference point on this topic in Australian law. That decision and many following it have enjoined trial judges to refrain from expounding the criminal standard of proof. For a recent discussion see R v Southammavong [2003] NSWCCA 312. 
     
      
       
      
    217 It does not follow that every judicial gloss buffed onto the golden thread of the common law constitutes a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      
    218 The directions given to the jury about the meaning of “beyond reasonable doubt” in Green were erroneous in several respects and their harmful impact had to be considered in their unique context. Nevertheless, the High Court’s discussion in Green contains warnings that embody general principles.  
     
      
       
      
    219 The summing up on standard of proof in Green was held to be confusing (at 32) and to suggest of that “a comfortable satisfaction of the accused’s guilt would be enough” (at 33). However, a fundamental point of error was described in the following terms (at 32-3): 
     
      
       
        
         
         A reasonable doubt is a doubt which the particular jury entertain in the circumstances. Jurymen themselves set the standard of what is reasonable in the circumstances. It is that ability which is attributed to them which is one of the virtues of our mode of trial: to their task of deciding facts they bring to bear their experience and judgment. They are both unaccustomed and not required to submit their processes of mind to objective analysis of the kind proposed in the language of the judge in this case. “It is not their task to analyse their own mental processes”: Windeyer J,  
         Thomas v The Queen 
          [(1960) 102 CLR at p606)]. A reasonable doubt which a jury may entertain is not to be confined to a “rational doubt”, or a “doubt founded on reason” in the analytical sense or by such detailed processes as those proposed by the passage we have quoted from the summing up. Yet that is what they were directed to do in this case. 
         
        
       
      
    220 The offending direction in Green included the following (at 30): 
     
      
       
        
         
         And you may say “Well, how do I know when I have got to a stage of being satisfied about something beyond reasonable doubt?” and the answer to that is that it is when you have reached the stage that you either have no doubt at all, because if you have got no doubt at all you must have got rid of all reasonable doubts; or if there is something nagging in the back of your mind which makes you hesitate as to whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, you have got to try and take it out and identify this thing which is causing the hesitation, causing the doubt if you like, and you have a look at it and you try to assess it and you say to yourself is this doubt that is bothering me, does it proceed from reason; is it a rational doubt; is it something which raises a really sensible doubt; or is it a fantastic sort of doubt; is it something which arises from some prejudice that I may have; some quite unreasonable fear that I might go  
         [sic] 
          wrong; some perhaps reluctance to make an unpleasant finding. Well, if it is one of those doubts – merely one of those doubts, then of course it cannot be described as reasonable because it does not come from reason; it comes from something which is emotional or irrational or – at any rate it is not based upon reason, and if you have had a look at what is bothering you and you decide that it does proceed from something which is not reason but something fantastic or rising out of prejudice or one of these other things, then you should say to yourself, “The only doubt I’ve got is one which is not based on reason, I have therefore got rid of all doubts which are not based in reason, and the result of that is that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, because the only things that are worrying me are things which I now assess after looking at them as not based in reason.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    221 The appellants submit that the directions in the present case share the fundamental defect exposed by the High Court in Green. They qualified the time-honoured standard by lessening it. 
     
      
       
      
    222 The vice of the present directions is said to be that the jury were invited to engage in “an analytic exercise dissecting such doubts as they may experience” (cf R v Ho (2002) 130 A Crim R 545 at 551 [27]). If any member of the jury entertained a reasonable doubt but was not able to identify the reason for that doubt then he or she would have been driven away from holding out for the acquittal to which the accused was entitled. The appellants cited R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 where Hunt CJ at CL (at 116-7) was critical of a trial judge who: 
     
      
       
        
         
         …invited the jury to ponder what exactly was meant by “reasonable”, and he suggested to them that the answer was not found in their own individual understanding of the work “reasonable”. 
         
        
       
      
    223 As to the fundamental consequence of a misdirection as to the onus of proof in a criminal trial, and the inapplicability of the proviso, the appellants cite Thomas v The Queen (1960) 102 CLR 581 at 588, 594, 596, 602 and 604. 
     
      
       
      
    224 The Crown submits, and we agree, that the early references to “reason” in the passage under examination are merely instructions to the jurors to exercise independent judgment. 
     
      
       
      
    225 The Crown further submits that the latter references to a doubt that “is based on reason” and “that is in fact reasonable” did not involve an invitation to the type of analytical approach admonished by the High Court. We agree. 
     
      
       
      
    226 The fleeting references to a “doubt based on reason” did not conjure up intricate diversions of the offending direction in Green. Nor did it entice the jury away from setting their own standard of reasonableness by minute subdivision and restatement of the time-honoured phrase. 
     
      
       
      
    227 In R v Li [2003] NSWCCA 386, a direction by the present trial judge referring to a “Doubt in your mind, and it’s a reasonable one” was held to be incorrect and inappropriate. Likewise a further reference to “a doubt based on reason”. The directions were then held to have caused the trial to miscarry. Despite the application of Rule 4 the misdirection was held to be fundamental and it contributed to an order quashing the conviction and ordering a new trial. In Li those misdirections were however compounded by being accompanied by an invitation to the jury to decide which of two cases (the complainant’s or the accused’s) was correct (see Dunford J at [72]. See also at [73]). There was also a separate misdirection on corroboration and the assessment of the complainant’s evidence that was found to be fundamentally flawed (see at [63]-[68], [76]). Li was decided after the judgment was reserved in the present appeals. It was drawn to this Court’s attention in a memorandum from senior counsel for Chami. It is persuasive but not conclusive on the present issue, because of the additional factors that contributed to the miscarriage there found established. 
     
      
       
      
    228 In R v Blanch, CCA unreported 17 August 1988 and R v Solomon, CCA unreported 15 November 1989, decisions to which our attention was drawn in a memorandum from senior counsel for Ghanem, this Court overturned convictions where the vices of the directions about standard of proof were that they contrasted beyond reasonable doubt with a state of “absolute certainty”. This comparative exercise was found to have put the wrong emphasis on the time-honoured direction. In Blanch the conviction was quashed even though redirection had not been sought. The vice attending Blanch and Solomon is not, however present in the directions complained of in the current appeals. 
     
      
       
      
    229 We do not endorse his Honour’s gloss. Its use should be discontinued. But the particular trial did not miscarry on this account. 
     
      
       
      
    230 These grounds fail. 
     
      
       
        
       Direction as to charge of unlawful detention (Chami 3) 
       
      
    231 Chami submits that inadequate directions were given as to the elements of the third count, the one generally referred to at trial as ""detention for sexual advantage"". The complaint focuses upon the factual elements of the count in the particular case. 
     
      
       
      
    232 There were general instructions in the Directions of Law. The summing up addressed the topic at several points (SU 84-5, 160-1, 182-3 and 194-5). At SU 153 counsel for Chami asked the trial judge to isolate the acts that the Crown would need to prove beyond reasonable doubt to establish the detaining. He also sought directions in relation to the defence case on that charge, pointing to inconsistencies in the complainant's statements about the car in which the gun was produced.  
     
      
       
      
    233 The judge gave the following directions (SU 160-1): 
     
      
       
        
         
         In the third count, the three men together are accused of detention. The acts of detention there, members of the jury, on the Crown case, commence from the time they have her in the car and will not let her get out. When she attempts to get out at the service station someone produces a gun. And then that detention continues until Chullora. She is then trapped in the car. That is the effect of her evidence, that all attempts by her to get out fail because the doors are locked, people get in and they stop her getting out, and the three of them are around the place, she doesn't know which one of them was in fact stopping her getting out at any particular time, all she knows is she couldn't, they all were keeping her there. When she did get out of the car they continued to detain her although not for sexual advantage. 
         
        
        
         
         It has been put to you in submissions that she has given differing accounts of the gun, whether she saw the gun, whether she didn't see the gun, was it held to her head, wasn't it held to her head. If you consider that she is unreliable in relation to a gun then you would have to look at her reliability in relation to other evidence. 
         
        
        
       
      
    234 In this Court Chami submits that these directions were confusing and introduced the concept that ""detention"" may be established merely by the fact of having sexual intercourse with the complainant against her will. It was not made sufficiently plain to the jury precisely how the Crown sought to make out its case on the third count. 
     
      
       
      
    235 Later the jury asked a question about the ""definition of the detainment"" in the context of count 1 against Mohammed Skaf. The further directions they were given also included reference to count 3, including (SU 182-3): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Now in relation to the other counts of detention, count 3 alleges the same thing, detention for advantage, against Mahmoud Chami, Bilal Skaf and Mohammed Ghanem. Now the evidence shows that she got into that car, having been persuaded to get into it with a promise that she'd be taken home; a false promise. But it was at a service station, when she attempted to get out and was prevented from getting out, that the detention started there. She was held from that point, she could not get out of the car. Now from that point to the time that the people in the red car handed her over to the next group, the Crown case is the three of them were detaining her. Whether she was actually in the car or outside the car, they still maintained a control over her. 
         
        
        
         
         So detaining can mean an actual locking in a room; it can mean a locking in a car; it can mean just standing around and making sure you don't move. In a sense they had her under arrest, they had arrested her; that's the Crown case. 
         
        
        
         
         Now before that red car went away, the next car came along, Mohammed Skaf took her behind a shed. From the time he took charge of her to the time he ceased to have anything to do with her, he was detaining her. And that continued up to the time she was dropped off at Lidcombe. 
         
        
        
         
         So that's the detaining. So there's a physical side to it, in a sense, but there's also a mental side to it. 
         
        
        
         
         I can actually hold you using my will-power and your fear that I won't let you go; each time you attempt to go, someone will bring you back. 
         
        
        
         
         And you will remember she gave evidence that on a number of occasions on this night, when she was in open places, she would attempt to leave and one would come and bring her back again. So if she’s standing outside the red car and they're around, they're still detaining her. That's detaining. It just means holding. And it’s holding for the purpose, for a sexual purpose, for sexual advantage. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    236 The appellants submit that these further directions would not have dispelled earlier confusion about the factual elements of the third count. We disagree. 
     
      
       
      
    237 At SU 192-5 counsel sought a further direction. He referred to the prosecutor's final address (at Tr p1104), submitting that the Crown had argued that the detention was complete when the complainant was lured and enticed into the red car. (In fact the prosecutor had said ""lured and enticed into the red car and held there"".) The prosecutor interrupted to confirm that the alleged detention did not cease when the complainant was lured into the car: it continued until the sexual advantage was gained. A proposed clarification was agreed to by Chami's counsel (SU 193) and was immediately given to the jury (SU 194-5). This direction included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
         So in the case of Mr Chami, say for example, Mr Chami gets into a car and she is in there, the doors are locked or held from the outside or she believes they are, now he is detaining her, she cannot get out of the back because he is keeping her there. Once he starts to have sex with her you can say in a sense he is detaining too because it is not possible to have sex unless they are with one another, one would think, and the actual crime is completed just before he has the sex. Do you understand what I mean; he holds her, she cannot get away and has sex. One of the men is holding her for the purpose of sex and one is to have the sex.  
          
         
        
       
      
    238 This last direction was favourable to the appellant, because there is no reason why detention should be complete before the intended sexual activity commences. And it removed any basis for the present complaint. 
     
      
       
      
    239 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions as to Chami’s knowledge (Chami 4) 
       
      
    240 Chami did not give evidence. He did not dispute the complainant’s evidence of non-consensual intercourse in the red car. However, he contended that it was oral not vaginal sex and he disputed that he knew she was not consenting. 
     
      
       
      
    241 Cross-examination of the complainant had elicited concessions that he had not threatened to hurt her (Tr p284) and she was not sure if she was crying until the assault commenced (Tr p289). 
     
      
       
      
    242 Chami’s case in his ERISP was that the complainant was an enthusiastic participant in oral intercourse; and that he had rejected any suggestion of vaginal intercourse because he did not have a condom. The Crown submits that neither honest and mistaken belief or recklessness arose on that version. We agree. Finnane DCJ gave a ruling to that effect shortly before Ms Francis addressed the jury (Tr p1216). 
     
      
       
      
    243 Chami submits that this was erroneous and that he was thereby deprived of the opportunity of raising a genuine issue. We disagree. 
     
      
       
      
    244 Chami’s counsel addressed on honest and mistaken belief and recklessness (Tr p 1231). 
     
      
       
      
    245 At SU 47 the jury were told: 
     
      
       
        
         
         In certain situations if the accused has a belief that the complainant is consenting, even though she in fact is not consenting, that belief means that he is not committing this offence. That is something that concerns only Mr Chami because he, through his counsel, raises the proposition that he believed Ms T was consenting even if Ms T was not. In no other of the cases is there any suggestion of any belief. 
         
        
        
       
      
    246 The written directions contained strong instructions about the need to prove subjective knowledge and they left recklessness in exemplary terms. They were: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The Crown must also prove that the accused  
         knew  
         that the complainant was not consenting. This is a subjective test. How then does the Crown prove the accused knew the complainant was not consenting? The Crown asks you to draw this conclusion from other facts which it has set out to prove that he must have known the complainant did not consent and indeed that he did know she was not consenting. 
         
        
        
         
         In a situation where the complainant does not in fact consent, the accused’s state of mind might be that at the time of the acts of sexual intercourse, he actually knew that she was not consenting. That is a guilty state of mind. If the Crown satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that that was the accused’s state of mind at the times of the acts of intercourse, then the Crown has made out this element of the charges. 
         
        
        
         
         Similarly, if the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was reckless, not caring whether the complainant consented or not, then it has made out this element of the case. Again, the test is a subjective one. What you have to determine is whether the accused actually was reckless, not caring whether the complainant consented or not. 
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand, the accused’s state of mind might be that he honestly, though wrongly believed that the complainant was consenting to intercourse. That is not a guilty state of mind. It is for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, at the time of the acts of intercourse, did not honestly believe that the complainant was consenting. If the Crown has not proved this, then you must acquit the accused. This applies to Mr Chami and Mr Mohammed Skaf (in relation to the acts at the Marion Street Carpark toilets). 
         
        
        
       
      
    247 Chami complains of a direction concerning recklessness given at SU 162 in the following terms (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
         In relation to recklessness, and this could only affect Mr Mohammed Skaf and Mr Chami, if the accused’s state of mind was such that he realised at the time he was having intercourse the possibility that the woman was not consenting and without more he has intercourse, then that is reckless.  
         If he doesn’t even bother considering whether she is consenting or not, and a risk that she was not consenting would be obvious to anyone, then that is reckless. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         So when you look at consent you try to look into somebody’s mind. If someone just comes along and starts having sex with a woman without asking any questions or doing anything and somebody says well, anybody would know she wouldn’t be consenting, anybody looking on could say look, how could you say that, then a question of recklessness arises. 
         
        
        
       He submits that this invited the jury to consider recklessness as an objective, not subjective, notion. 
        
       
      
    248 No complaint was raised about this direction. It would not, in our view, have been seen as an invitation to apply an objective approach. The written directions pointed so strongly the opposite way.  
     
      
       
      
    249 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions relating to address of counsel (Mohamed Skaf 9) 
       
      
    250 Mohamed Skaf submits that a miscarriage occasioned from directions which undermined the address of his counsel and unfairly prejudiced his case. 
     
      
       
      
    251 Early in the summing up the judge said this (SU 4): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Now I want to say this to start with, and it’s something that arises to some extent from Mr Jankowski's address. This is the 21st century since the birth of Christ. We're not in the 19th century or the 18th or the 17th. Whatever they might have done in those centuries, the law now is perfectly clear. Any woman is entitled to refuse consent to sexual intercourse at any time.  
         
        
        
         
         There is no concept in our law that there is a category of person called 'loose women' who are deemed somehow to consent. And certainly there is no law that merely because a young woman might give an indication that she was friendly with someone and did not protest too much when they were laying hands on her, that she therefore was consenting to anything that that person or anyone else might want to do at any time thereafter. That is not the law. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    252 Mohamed Skaf submits that there was nothing in the address of his trial counsel that warranted this direction. He further submits that the effect of the direction was to suggest to the jury that his defence was that the complainant was ""asking for it"" because she had not objected to earlier touching in the train and at Bankstown Station. This was not the defence. The complainant’s non-objection to earlier touching of a sexual nature was however relevant to the issues of consent and belief of consent. 
     
      
       
      
    253 It is further submitted that the reference to the birth of Christ was unfortunate in the context of the trial of four Muslims. It was perhaps inappropriate, but no miscarriage stemmed from it. Reference to a particular century of the modern era as being the X century after Christ is commonplace and no more than an explicit statement of the assumption upon which the worldwide calendar proceeds. Nothing in the judge’s remark conveyed some hidden message concerning the presumed faith-system of the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    254 There were firm directions to the jury about the need to put aside any religious or political bias stemming from an assumption that the accused were Muslims or any presupposition is about Muslims, either favourable or unfavourable (SU 41-43). 
     
      
       
      
    255 The real issue is whether the judge's remarks about a woman’s right to withhold or revoke consent unfairly undermined this appellant's defence.  
     
      
       
      
    256 We find no fault with these directions. Written and oral instructions were given elsewhere, in exemplary terms, as to the issues of the complainant's consent and the state of knowledge that the Crown had to prove against persons accused of sexual assaults. It was quite proper for the judge to remind the jury that consent may be withdrawn and that consent to touching of a sexual nature cannot be translated into consent to sexual intercourse of an entirely different nature in a different context. [We are not inferring that the complainant did consent to what happened in the train and in the walk from Bankstown Station. There was however evidence that was relied upon in the final address of Mohamed Skaf’s counsel (Tr p1189) that opened the issue while at the same time providing a context for the judge to say what he did. The jury were reminded of this evidence at SU 114-5.]  
     
      
       
      
    257 The judge’s remarks did not disparage the defence or cause the trial to miscarry. The matters now complained of were not raised at the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    258 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions on complainant’s reliability (Chami 6, Mohammed Skaf 7) 
        
       
      
    259 The complainant’s credibility as a witness (as distinct from her honesty) was assailed in various ways at the trial. She was cross-examined vigorously on a number of fronts. Uncertainties and discrepancies in her evidence were highlighted in cross-examination, in final address and the jury were reminded of them in the summing up. 
     
      
       
      
    260 The present complaint is that the directions did not warn the jury of the need to scrutinize the complainant’s evidence carefully. Reliance is placed on the comment by Lee J in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19:  
     
      
       
        
         
         In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinized with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness’ evidence is unreliable. 
         
        
       
      
    261 It is pertinent to observe that Lee J followed these remarks with an observation that failure to give the direction referred to did not necessarily lead to the verdict being set aside. In Murray itself the appeal against conviction was dismissed. This Court has recently held that the authorities do not mandate the giving of a Murray direction in all cases where there is a conflict between the evidence of the complainant and the accused (R v Burt [2003] NSWCCA 248). 
     
      
       
      
    262 It is also pertinent that the Crown case against each accused did not depend solely upon acceptance of the complainant’s testimony. The circumstantial and corroborative evidence against these appellants was very strong. 
     
      
       
      
    263 During the summing up, counsel for Bilal Skaf sought a direction based on s165(1)(b) and (c) referable to the reliability of the complainant’s identification evidence. He also sought a direction in accordance with R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82. In the course of his submissions, Mr Healey referred in passing to a Murray direction to the effect that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of a crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion can be arrived at (SU 27). No other counsel sought such a direction and Bilal Skaf’s ground of appeal complaining about the absence of a Markuleski direction was not pressed in this Court. None of this assists Mohammed Skaf who nevertheless draws attention to it in an attempt to answer the rule 4 implications touching his ground of appeal on this topic. 
     
      
       
      
    264 It is however clear that Chami’s trial counsel asked late in the summing up for a warning based on Murray. Judge Finnane refused (SU p152). He pointed out that Chami did not dispute that sexual intercourse had taken place. It was obvious to the jury and covered in the written directions that the issue as to whether the Crown established that intercourse was non-consensual depended upon accepting the evidence of the complainant. The judge declined to warn that it was dangerous to convict or to direct the jury that the complainant’s evidence might be unreliable. We see no error here. Identification was not in issue and there was nothing on the facts that attracted the need for a reliability warning in accordance with s165(1)(c). 
     
      
       
      
    265 The whole tenor of the summing up was one that directed the jury to scrutinize the complainant’s evidence with care (see Written Directions and SU 10, 19, 88, 89, 96-97). Specific inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence referable to Chami were addressed at SU 141-143. 
     
      
       
      
    266 Chami adds submissions based upon a particular passage in the complainant’s evidence (Tr p285) in which she expressed some uncertainty about the precise mechanics of her sexual assault by Chami. This particular submission has not been overlooked, but it is without merit. It was not incumbent on the judge to draw particular attention to this passage, particularly if no request to that effect was made. 
     
      
       
      
    267 Counsel for Mohammed Skaf did not seek a warning in accordance with s165. But the jury would have been in no doubt as to the need to scrutinize the complainant’s evidence with great care in relation to the two principal issues raised in his defence at the trial. There is no reason why rule 4 should not be applied in his case. 
     
      
       
      
    268 These grounds fail. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions as to allegations against non-accused (Chami 2, Mohammed Skaf 3) 
        
       
      
    269 These two appellants submit that the jury were misdirected, and that the general credibility of the complainant was enhanced unfairly by the manner in which the judge referred to assaults at the hands of men who were not the accused in the particular trial. 
     
      
       
      
    270 These were the men (other than Mohammed Skaf) who had intercourse in the Marion Street toilet block and the men in the black car. The complainant had given evidence as to these sexual assaults in the course of her structured narrative covering the entire evening. There was no objection nor any challenge by cross-examination or otherwise to the evidence about these additional assaults. Not only was the material not objected to, it was clearly relevant if only as going to the issue of whether the complainant consented to the later incidents involving those on trial. There are likely also to have been tactical reasons for allowing this evidence to be given. Some lines of cross-examination of the complainant focussed upon the likelihood of confusion stemming from the totality of events as well as confusion between the red and black cars (cf the issues raised in connection with the ground of appeal concerning H’s statement, dealt with above). 
     
      
       
      
    271 As Finnane DCJ remarked when refusing the request of Chami’s counsel for a redirection on this issue (SU 155), no one cross-examined the complainant along the lines of suggesting that she was a liar who had made up a fantastic invention.  
     
      
       
      
    272 Obviously the complainant’s credibility remained central and it was challenged in various ways as best suited the respective defences. But the passing references to the sexual assaults at the hands of men who were not on trial were fair reflections of the context of the Crown case. The complainant’s credibility on the issues that mattered was not unfairly bolstered. 
     
      
       
      
    273 The judge touched on this evidence, very lightly, while recounting the complainant’s narrative. He told the jury that the complainant’s evidence about these assaults being non-consensual was uncontested (SU 7). The context made it perfectly clear that he was referring to particular incidents that did not involve any of the accused who were on trial. 
     
      
       
      
    274 When Judge Finnane came to give general directions on the question of consent involving Mohammed Skaf and the incident involving him in the Marion Street toilet, he said the following (SU 51, emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
         If a woman gives a consent, although a grudging one, that is consent. You have to examine all the circumstances. In this particular case, you will bear in mind what I said to you earlier, that, on the Crown case, she was sexually assaulted without her consent by at least four men in the toilets at the Marion Street carpark. There is no evidence to the contrary. 
         
        
        
         
         It is possible that you could disbelieve it.  
         If you were prepared to disbelieve every word she said you could disbelieve that that occurred at all. After all, it is her credibility, you are entitled as a jury not to believe anything she said, just as you are entitled to believe everything, but normally, one would think, in a case where there is nothing to the contrary of something having happened you would tend to think it did happen.  
         So at least four men sexually assaulted her in those toilets against her will, and I will come to the detail of it tomorrow. 
         
        
        
         
         The question is did the  
         fifth one 
         , he was not the fifth in order but he was part of the group, Mr Mohammed Skaf, did he sexually assault her against her will or did she agree to have sex with him but with none of the others? 
         
        
        
       
      
    275 Mohammed Skaf and Chami submit that these directions were erroneous and that the trial miscarried in consequence. 
     
      
       
      
    276 Mohammed Skaf was the first man alleged to have had intercourse with the complainant. He submits that what occurred afterwards had no bearing on the consent issue as regards what happened in the Marion Street carpark toilet. Accordingly, it was irrelevant to look at the improbability of the complainant consenting to a series of sexual encounters with different men, all of them strangers, in different places. He was the first and the complainant consented to intercourse with him at the Marion Street carpark, whatever may have happened later. 
     
      
       
      
    277 Chami’s complaint is a different one, although it seeks to attach itself to that of Mohammed Skaf. He contends that the general bolstering of the complainant’s evidence harmed his defence that he believed that the intercourse which took place later, in the red car, was consensual.  
     
      
       
      
    278 It is convenient to address Chami’s appeal first. It has no merit, particularly bearing in mind that Chami was ultimately at pains to concede the Crown case of lack of consent, confining himself to putting the Crown to proof that he knew the complainant was not consenting. In any event, it was perfectly open to the judge to put the complainant’s evidence fully and fairly to the jury, including her (unchallenged) evidence as to the assaults suffered at the hands of the other men. The manner of the directions did not unfairly bolster the complainant’s credibility. 
     
      
       
      
    279 Mohammed Skaf’s submission is a stronger one, because the incident involving him in the Marion Street toilet was the first act of sexual intercourse and because there was evidence of the complainant’s non-objection to what he says were the early overtures on the train and in the walk from Bankstown station. 
     
      
       
      
    280 But before we address it, we point out that it was Mohammed Skaf’s counsel who positively embraced the fact that other assaults had occurred, suggesting that guilty pleas had already been entered (Mr Jankowski’s address at Tr p1200). (This submission about the guilty pleas was later withdrawn because it overstated the evidence.) 
     
      
       
      
    281 At SU 114-7 the judge recounted in detail the factual material relied upon respectively by the Crown and the defence on the issue of whether the complainant consented to sexual intercourse with Mohammed Skaf in the Marion Street toilet. Towards the end of the passage he said (SU 116-7): 
     
      
       
        
         
         It basically was put that all the way to the toilets he was, you know, making it plain what he wanted, and she was willing to be in it. And then when they got there, she was happy to have sex with him; but as far as the others, she didn’t want to have anything to do with the others. 
         
        
        
         
         He, however, on his version, merely walked out and left her to her fate. 
         
        
        
         
         Well, it’s possible, ladies and gentlemen, that she could have consented to have sex with one out of five. I suppose the fact that he showed what could be regarded as extreme callousness afterwards wouldn’t necessarily show that that was not so. But certainly you’ve got to look at all the actions of both the parties during that relevant period. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    282 The reference to “extreme callousness” was based upon Mohammed Skaf’s statement in his ERISP of 13 November 2000 (Q & A 34) that he was told later that the others “went through her” and that he “didn’t really care what they did to her”. It was open for this judicial observation to be made.  
     
      
       
      
    283 The directions as a whole made it clear that the jury had to give separate consideration to the case against Mohammed Skaf on counts 1 and 2. The factual bases of the defence argument that lack of consent was not established by the Crown were fully laid out before the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    284 The submission remains that the judge’s reference to the possibility of consent to sex with one out of the five men at the toilet was an invitation to view things globally and to rely upon what happened later as evidence of the complainant’s earlier state of mind. In our opinion there was no misdirection or miscarriage. The sexual assaults by other (later) men at the Marion Street toilets were proved without objection and were part of the narrative relevant to other issues. To suggest that it was possible that the complainant consented to sex with Mohammed Skaf and later refused consent to the others was a necessary and proper direction to ensure that the jury did not overlook the need to consider the case against Mohammed Skaf separately. 
     
      
       
      
    285 One can envisage a direction about such a possibility so ringing with sarcasm as to be unfair. This was not the situation here, nor was it viewed as such at trial. The Crown is entitled to invoke rule 4. As indicated, the facts relied upon to indicate that the encounter with Mohammed Skaf was consensual were fairly placed before the jury in the summing up. 
     
      
       
      
    286 We reject the submission that the directions were to the effect that the jury might permissibly reason that if the complainant refused consent to the others at the toilet, then she must have done likewise for Mohammed Skaf. 
     
      
       
      
    287 These grounds fail. 
     
      
       
       Failure to give directions identifying the evidence admissible against Mohammed Skaf (Mohammed Skaf 4 ) 
        
       
      
    288 This complaint, which was not raised at trial, has no substance. 
     
      
       
      
    289 The trial judge provided the jury with a ""Summary of facts for each case"". In truth it was a brief summary of the issues plus a checklist of the major evidentiary sources led against each accused. For each accused, under the heading “Evidence against [name of accused]” the first item was simply stated as: “Evidence of [Ms T]”.  
     
      
       
      
    290 The appellant submits that this meant that the jury were not given proper assistance about the evidence of the complainant admissible against him. In fact that information was provided in the summing up itself. The jury were reminded in detail about the complainant’s evidence referable to this accused (see eg SU 98-102), including the evidence referable to the particular issues of consent and identification (SU 114-123). The jury were also left in no doubt that the key issues referable to this accused were consent and the accused's belief as to consent as regards the intercourse in the toilet at the Marion Street carpark; and the identification of the accused as the assailant at the industrial complex.  
     
      
       
        
       Directions on identification warnings (Ghanem 2, Mohammed Skaf 6) 
        
       
      
    291 The complainant’s identification of Ghanem was the key issue in the case against him. And her identification of Mohammed Skaf as the man in the yellow jumper who returned at the industrial complex was critical in relation to his conviction on the counts relating to that place. This is not to assert that it was the only evidence that located these accused at the scene of their alleged crimes (see above). 
     
      
       
      
    292 The Written Directions as to identification generally were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Identification 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         The accused Bilal Skaf, Mohammed Ghanem and Mohammed Skaf, (in relation only to the alleged assaults at Chullora) have each, through his counsel, submitted that there is doubt about the identification of himself as the perpetrator of any assault on the complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         You must approach any evidence of identification with considerable caution before you accept it as reliable. This caution is necessary even if you accept the complainant as completely honest. 
         
        
        
         
         Many witnesses are honest but not reliable. 
         
        
        
         
         In this case, the identification is that of the complainant [Ms T]. She identified each of these accused and two other assailants, Tayyab Sheikh and  
         [“H”] 
          by looking at photoboards. She did not identify Mahmoud Chami. 
         
        
        
         
         However, the reliability of this identification evidence has been challenged by the counsel for Bilal Skaf, Mohammed Skaf and Mohammed Ghanem. I will take you to those challenges. The fact that they have been made means that you must exercise caution in accepting the identification evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         You have to take into account the opportunity she had for observation, her age, her mental condition, her reliability, the fact that she made two different statements about the events of this night and gave varying accounts to different people, of what had happened. You should also take into account the effects on her mind produced by the ordeal she suffered on this night and the effect that would have had on her ability to identify each of the accused. Was she certain, was she hesitant, was she reliable. You must take into account when the particular identifications were made. 
         
        
        
         
         You must bear in mind that many people mistakenly identify others and grave miscarriages of justice can occur if identification is mistaken. 
         
        
        
       
      
    293 Ghanem submits that the jury were misdirected when they were informed that there was no doubt, in light of the complainant’s photoboard identification of Tayyab Sheikh and H, that those two men were at Bankstown on the night and that they, on the Crown case, both assaulted the complainant (SU 91).  
     
      
       
      
    294 He does not suggest that this was an inaccurate statement about the complainant's evidence or the Crown submissions based upon it in relation to these two men. The submission is however that the jury would have been confused into thinking that there was an unchallenged identification of Ghanem as well.  
     
      
       
      
    295 We have already indicated why it was open to the judge to recount without undue elaboration the entire narrative of the evening in question even though it touched upon assaults at the hands of men who were not accused at this particular trial. We have also considered the passage at SU 91-2, with its references to the complainant having identified four people clearly, and would reject the submission that the jury might have thought that one of those four people was Ghanem. In our view, the jury would have understood that Ghanem was not one of the four. The matter might have been expressed with greater clarity, but read fairly, the ""four"" were Tayyab Sheikh, H, Mohammed Skaf and Chami. The passage at SU 90 explained that Chami was one of the four because the complainant had given a description of him and because Chami had admitted his presence in the red car. 296 When the judge turned to consider questions of identification in relation to ""the other three"" he made it quite explicit that they were Bilal Skaf, Mohammed Skaf (as regards the later assault) and Ghanem. The written and oral directions were replete with instructions about the factual issues relevant to the disputed identification of Ghanem. 
     
      
       
      
    297 We would also reject Ghanem's submission that the directions suggested to the jury that the disputed identifications were in some way bolstered by those that were not in issue at the trial.  
     
      
       
      
    298 Nor do we accept Ghanem’s submission that the composition of the photoboard called for a particular need for a judicial warning on that matter. No such direction was sought trial. 
     
      
       
      
    299 Rule 4 should be applied. Ghanem’s ground of appeal in its several manifestations should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      
    300 Mohamad Skaf's ground of appeal in relation to the identification directions follows a broadly similar path. He too submits that unfairness and confusion were generated by the terms in which the judge referred to the complainant's photoboard identification of Tayyab Sheikh and H, the unchallenged identification of Chami as the man in the red car and the undisputed identification of himself (Mohammed Skaf) as the first man in the Marion Street toilet. He draws particular attention to the remark (at SU 92) that: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Well, you have got to take all that into account, you have got to take into account she has identified four people clearly and not identified another one. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    301 It is however fanciful to suggest that this comment harmed the appellant on the issue of identification concerning the later incident at the industrial complex. The written and oral directions were as clear as possible that such identification was disputed and that the evidence touching that issue required separate examination (see SU 93-4, 117-120).302 To the very limited extent that comparison was being drawn between the disputed and undisputed identifications, this was at most neutral and probably favourable to those appellants who raised issues about the complainant's identification of them. But as regards Mohammed Skaf there is a further air of unreality about this present complaint. The real issue touching his guilt in relation to the sexual assault at the industrial complex turned upon the cogency of the evidence that the man who undisputedly was on the train and the first to go into the toilet cubicle at Marion Street was the same as the man in the yellow jumper who turned up at the industrial complex. The complainant gave firm and compelling evidence that he was, and this evidence drew considerable support from the independent material about the mobile phone and the SIM card in it. The jury would not have been deflected from fairly addressing this aspect of the Crown case by the passing remarks directed at the uncontested evidence concerning Tayyab Sheikh and H who had been involved in the Marion Street toiled incidents. There were certainly factual issues relevant to the assessment of the complainant's evidence identifying Mohammed Skaf at the industrial complex, but they were drawn to the attention of the jury ( SU 117-9). 
     
      
       
      
    303 These grounds fail. 
     
      
       
        
       Evidence and Directions as to consciousness of guilt (Bilal Skaf 3-4, Mohammed Skaf 8) 
        
       
      
    304 The Crown did not open to the jury that it would rely on Bilal Skaf's lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt. But after his plea of guilty to counts 16 and 17 (relating to attempts to pervert the course of justice), the court was informed that the prosecution wished to rely on the underlying material as evidence of consciousness of guilt. The judge correctly ruled that the material was admissible for such use. 
     
      
       
      
    305 Despite the form of Bilal Skaf’s ground 3, we understand his complaint about consciousness of guilt to be confined to the way it was dealt with in the directions to the jury.  
     
      
       
      
    306 In her closing address to the jury the Crown prosecutor did not refer to ""consciousness of guilt"" in terms. But Bilal Skaf’s counsel addressed the jury on the matter, suggesting the subject matter of the guilty pleas did not evidence consciousness of guilt (Tr p1155). 
     
      
       
      
    307 The written directions given to the jury included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
         5. Consciousness of Guilt  
          
         • The Crown says that the accused Bilal Skaf has by his actions before this trial exhibited a consciousness of guilt. 
         
        
        
         
         • It says that there is evidence that he made out a false statement to police seeking to provide a false alibi for himself and for his brother Mohammed Skaf. ( Exhibit C17, C42 and C43). 
         
        
        
         
         • It also says that he sought to recruit Susan Bakry, Tayyab Sheikh and Tahir Sheikh to support these false alibis. (see Exhibits C42 and C43). 
         
        
        
         
         • If you are satisfied that this is so and that these lies are about important matters in the trial (and you might think that providing false alibis to the police about himself and his brother are lies about important matters) AND that the lies show he has a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it, AND that he told the lies because he knew that the truth about the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the matter, or, to put it another way, because he had a realisation and a fear of the truth, then you can take those lies into account for the purpose of concluding that he was acting with a consciousness of guilt of the offences charged against him. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    308 There were further directions on consciousness of guilt in the summing up. The judge told the jury that there was evidence that Bilal Skaf had made a false statement to police to provide a false alibi for ""himself and his brother Mohammed Skaf"". He continued (SU 80-1): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Now those matters concern not just his brother, but also him. He is said by the Crown to be involved in serious sexual assaults on this night. 
         
        
        
         
         So if you're satisfied that he has done that, that these matters are lies, I've expressed a view - there's no two ways about it – I’ve expressed a view about what they are. Like all views about facts in this case, they are my views, but you're entitled to agree or disagree with them. If you're satisfied that he’s done those things, and it would seem to me that you probably would be, and those lies are about important matters in the trial - and I've put in the paragraph you might think providing false alibis to police about himself and his brother would be important matters - and they show, the lies show he has a knowledge of the offence or offences or some aspect of it, and he told the lies because he knew the truth about the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the matter, or because he had a realisation of the truth and a fear of the truth, you can take them into account for the purpose of concluding that he was acting with a consciousness of guilt of the offences charged against him. 
         
        
        
         
         So if you think that he was doing these things because he was aware he was involved in committing these offences and he was doing it, that’s his motivation for being involved in these false alibis, that that shows there is present in his mind a consciousness of guilt, then you can take that into account as evidence against him of the offences for which he’s been charged. 
         
        
        
         
         If, however you think there's a reasonable possibility that he was telling lies for some reason not connected with a consciousness of guilt, then you can't use it for that purpose.  
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    309 Bilal Skaf accepts that the written directions were in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193. His complaint in this Court concerns the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury that other potential reasons for his conduct were a desire to protect his brother, or a dishonest attempt to escape an unjust accusation. He cites well-known judicial warnings about the risk that juries may misapply evidence of this nature, coupled with injunctions to trial judges to instruct juries in appropriate cases that there may be reasons for telling a lie apart from the realisation of guilt and that those reasons should be considered and excluded before using the lie as an admission of guilt (R v Lucas [1981] QB 720 at 724, R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697 at 701, Edwards at 210-11). 
     
      
       
      
    310 Bilal Skaf submits that the judge erred in permitting the Crown to rely on this material as evidence of consciousness of guilt. The deceptive conduct was directed at the protection of his brother (who had already been interviewed by the police) and nothing else. Bilal Skaf was not identified by the appellant until 15 November 2000. Alternatively, it is submitted that the facts called for strong directions about other potential reasons for lying, particularly in a trial where Bilal Skaf did not give evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    311 The Crown argued before us, as it had at trial (Tr pp662, 675), that the conduct had a dual aspect that included Bilal Skaf seeking assistance to corroborate his version of events that he was at home as well as his brother.  
     
      
       
      
    312 The real issue on the facts was whether the jury should conclude that Bilal Skaf set about attempting to gather false evidence in order to protect himself as well as his brother. If so this would be clear evidence of his consciousness of guilt. Bilal Skaf obviously knew that the police were investigating allegations of sexual assault concerning this complainant and the events of the particular evening. 
     
      
       
      
    313 The written directions required the jury to consider the possibility that factors other than consciousness of his own guilt motivated Bilal Skaf to make the intercepted phone calls (see above). Bilal Skaf’s counsel urged the jury to view the conversations as directed solely to garnering support for his brother’s case (Tr pp1132-3, 1155.). The material was certainly capable of supporting a wider view. The real issue was factual and the jury received adequate instruction on it. No further directions were sought. 
     
      
       
      
    314 Rule 4 applies. This ground fails. 
     
      
       
      
    315 Mohammed Skaf had admittedly told significant lies in his early ERISPs. Yet the written and oral directions squarely instructed the jury that consciousness of guilt affected only Bilal Skaf. The jury were correctly told that Mohammed Skaf’s lies in the early ERISPs were relevant only to the credibility of the accounts he gave in the later ERISPs. (SU 78 and Written Directions). 
     
      
       
      
    316 When dealing with Chami, the judge gave exemplary directions as to possible reasons for telling lies (SU 71). He then recounted Mohammed Skaf’s ERISPs and referred to the Crown submissions about deliberate lies and their impact on the credibility of his case based upon his last ERISP (SU 77-8). The jury told (SU 78): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Well, you look at his explanation for why he told those lies. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    317 Mohammed Skaf submits that the jury should have been warned against the danger of concluding that he lied because he was guilty. Absence of consent on the complainant’s part could not be proved through reliance upon the ERISP lies where the Crown had not asserted consciousness of guilt. Yet there was a danger that the jury might do this, especially if there was no attempt to isolate the particular matters which could be established as lies. 
     
      
       
      
    318 This last submission is uncompelling. The central and obvious lie was the false story about the visit to Canberra. 
     
      
       
      
    319 Mohammed Skaf cites Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234. That was a case in which the trial judge raised the issue of consciousness of guilt but failed to give a full Edwards direction. By contrast the present jury were told not to consider consciousness of guilt in relation to Mohammed Skaf. This removed any danger of inappropriate reasoning based upon consciousness of guilt (cf Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 77 ALJR 1433, [2003] HCA 40 at [34]). 
     
      
       
      
    320 The instruction that “people have many reasons” for telling lies sufficiently reminded the jury that lying did not necessarily betoken guilt. The other directions amply brought home the need to be satisfied on the key issues of consent and identification and the centrality of the complainant’s evidence on these matters. 
     
      
       
      
    321 These grounds fail. 
     
      
       
        
       General lack of balance and atmosphere of prejudice (Chami 7, Mohammed Skaf 10)  
        
       
      
    322 These appellants submit that the manner in which the trial judge conducted the proceedings and the terms of his summing up resulted in the jury's deliberations being conducted in an atmosphere of unfair prejudice. This portmanteau complaint partly repeats earlier grounds of appeal and differs slightly as between the appellants when broken down into specific integers. 
     
      
       
      
    323 Chami points to the following: 
     
      
       
       i) the refusal to permit counsel to address on his mistaken belief that the complainant was not consenting ( cf Chami 4); 
        
       ii) references in the summing up to the assaults earlier committed by others not on trial as having been  
       ""established through lack of challenge"" 
        (cf Chami 2); 
        
       iii) the Crown prosecutor's ""comment"" made during the cross-examination of Mr Chami's sister-in-law that he would not  
       ""have the opportunity"" 
        of cross-examining Chami (cf Chami 5); 
        
       iv) the comment made by the Crown prosecutor during closing address referring to the complainant having been subjected  
       ""to a cruel ordeal"" 
        in having to give evidence at the trial; 
        
       v) the judicial statement made in the course of the following cross-examination of Ghanem (Tr p 1023) : 
        
        
         
         Q. Did you have any discussions with Bilal Skaf about the events of the night before? 
          
         A. What? What happened the night before? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. The 30 August was the night on which [Ms T ] was assaulted by four groups of men. 
          
         A. Yeah. 
          
          
         
        
       
      
    324 We have already dealt with items (i)-(iii) individually. 
     
      
       
      
    325 As to (iv), the submission overstates the prosecutor’s remarks. They were directed specifically to the process of making complaint to the police (see Tr p1095). If they may have conveyed a hint of reference to her role as a witness the connexion was fleeting. Nothing reflected on the conduct of any cross-examiner. 
     
      
       
      
    326 As to (v), the transcript does not disclose the manner in which this statement was made. It is submitted that it was uttered with a degree of emphasis and conviction that would have conveyed to everyone in the crowded courtroom that the judge had formed a firm and committed view about the guilt of the appellants. There is no evidence supporting this proposition. 
     
      
       
      
    327 His Honour's comment attracted no immediate attention from any of the counsel at the trial. Ghanem’s cross-examination continued over nine further pages of transcript until the morning tea adjournment at Tr p1032 . After the adjournment it continued until its completion (Tr p1046). Ghanem called another witness and then closed his case. Chami then commenced his case, calling three character witnesses. It was during the Crown prosecutor's cross-examination of one of those witnesses that the comment about not having the opportunity of cross examining Chami was made. Chami's counsel then made the unsuccessful application for the discharge of the jury based upon that alleged ""comment"" that we have already dealt with as a substantive ground of appeal. Then followed a successful application by Ghanem for a directed verdict on one of the counts in the indictment. 
     
      
       
      
    328 The Crown prosecutor then commenced her address (Tr p 1083). It was obviously fairly late in the afternoon because it was not very long before the trial was adjourned to the next morning.  
     
      
       
      
    329 It was only the next morning that Chami's counsel applied for a discharge of the jury (Tr p1089). Ms Francis raised three matters, two of them being items (i) and (iii) as set out above. The application was refused. As regards item (iv) Finnane DCJ said that he was unable to see that his statement could in any way have prejudiced any of the accused. The evidence showed that the complainant had been assaulted by four groups of men. So far as Chami was concerned, he did not dispute that other persons may have assaulted Ms T, but he said that he did not do so himself. The judge added that the jury would of course have to be told that it was a matter for them to determine whether in fact anybody was assaulted or not assaulted. They would also be told that, while the trial judge was entitled to make comments on the facts, it would be the jury's version of the facts, not his, that counted. [Directions along these lines were given later, in the summing up: see SU 10-12] As regards item (iii), there had already been a ruling on this matter which the judge declined to change. His Honour dealt with one other matter that had been raised and that is no longer in issue. The application to discharge the jury was refused. 
     
      
       
      
    330 Counsel for Ghanem (Ms Langley) later sought a discharge based upon the “cruel ordeal” remark (Tr p1109). The judge declined, indicating that he proposed to say something during the summing up about the process of trial and the examination and cross examination of the complainant (Tr p1110). It appears that this was overlooked and the judge was not reminded about the matter.331 In this Court, Chami relies upon the totality of these matters in support of his compendious ground of appeal. In addition, it is submitted that it was particularly inappropriate for the judge to have said in his reasons for declining the discharge that ""I am unable to see that my making that statement [about four groups of men assaulting Ms T] could in any way prejudice any of the accused in any respect since it is a mere statement of fact as I can see it"". Chami submits that such a remark was tantamount to a finding of guilt by the trial judge during the pendency of the trial. This submission dramatically overstates the position. In the first place, the judge's reasons for refusing the discharge were not disclosed to the jury. Secondly, those reasons were not seen then or now as the basis for an objection grounded upon a reasonable apprehension of bias. Thirdly, the remarks were little more than a firm assertion of a judicial right that was never taken up in the present trial. As indicated, the summing up contained standard directions as to the respective roles of judge and jury. Nothing was put to the jury about the judge having any opinion as to whether any of the accused before them were guilty of the offences charged. As regards others who were not before the jury, the complainant had given evidence without objection, cross-examination or challenge as to assaults committed in the toilets at the Marion Street car park and in the black car. There is no need to supplement our earlier reasons concluding that nothing relating to this evidence caused any miscarriage.  
     
      
       
      
    332 Similar reasoning applies to the complaint based on item (v) above. The judicial clarification offered to Mr Ghanem to assist him in understanding the question put in cross-examination would not have been seen by the jury as expressing any view relevant to the guilt of the four accused at trial. The failure to raise prompt objection and the absence of evidence supporting the submission that the judge spoke with a degree of emphasis and conviction that inferred guilt means that we are entirely unpersuaded by this particular challenge to the fairness of the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    333 None of the five matters complained of, taken singly or together, establish a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
       
      
    334 Mohamed Skaf adopted Chami's submissions in aid of his identical ground of appeal, save that he also invoked the cumulative effect of his own nine grounds of appeal. We have considered his complaint in this context but equally find it to be without merit. 
     
      
       
      
    335 These grounds of appeal must be rejected. 
     
      
       
        
       Unreasonable verdict (Bilal Skaf 1) 
       
      
    336 Bilal Skaf submitted that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had positively and reliably identified him. He also submitted under this ground that he had suffered unfair prejudice from the fact that Chami in his ERISP had implicated him to a degree (Ex C33, pp223, 227-32). Chami did not give evidence. The jury were given directions that this ERISP was only to be regarded as evidence in the case against Chami. 
     
      
       
      
    337 The jury were told repeatedly that the Crown case against Bilal Skaf depended upon their acceptance of the complainant's evidence. The Directions of Law concluded with the instruction: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she has correctly and reliably identified each accused and correctly and reliably established to your satisfaction that he did the things she claims, you must find that accused not guilty. However, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she has correctly identified the accused and his crimes then you should convict him. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    338 Bilal Skaf submits that the ""identification"" of him by the complainant was not in fact identification evidence at all. The form of this submission suggests that the real complaint concerns wrongful admission of evidence. However, an attack on the conviction itself on the ground that it was unreasonable having regard to the identification evidence is not lacking in precedent (see Pitkin v The Queen (1995) 69 ALJR 612). The nub of the complaint in the written and oral submissions centres upon the words used by the complainant when she was shown the array of photos that included a photo of the appellant. The complainant went from ""No 15 sort of looks familiar"" to ""I think he was the offender identified as Sam 2"" to ""he looks a lot like him"". 
     
      
       
      
    339 Citing Pitkin, Bilal Skaf submits that this was not an act of identification at all, but rather a statement that he resembled the offender. In addition, the procedure took place two and a half months after the event and the quality of the photograph that was used to identify him was poor. An application at trial for the identification evidence to be withdrawn because of unfairness in the array was rejected (Tr p623-4). 
     
      
       
      
    340 Pitkin is distinguishable, because the conviction was based solely upon the purported identification of a witness who said that the offender “looked like” the person in the photograph. 
     
      
       
      
    341 Here the complainant’s evidence was considerably stronger. The jury had the video-recording of the whole process. The complainant looked at the photoboard and said “Number 15 sort of looks familiar” in relation to the person she called “Sam 2”. Detective Porta asked her how sure she was and she said “I’m not 100% sure… but he looks a hell of a lot like the person I identified as Sam 2” (Tr p384). His eyebrows stood out to her. In her evidence she explained that she was not 100% sure because it was not a very good photo (Tr pp420, 445). 
     
      
       
      
    342 There was also the additional evidence implicating Bilal Skaf to which we have already drawn attention. 
     
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
      
    343 The appeals against conviction of Mahmoud Chami, Bilal Skaf and Mohammed Skaf are dismissed. Mohamed Ghanem’s appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence are set aside and a new trial is ordered. ******************

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Sperling J: On 17 March 2003, the applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing one count of driving in a manner dangerous causing death (s52A(1) Crimes Act 1900), and one count of driving in a manner dangerous causing grievous bodily harm (s52A(3) Crimes Act). On 26 May 2003, Dodd DCJ sentenced the applicant, in relation to the first count, to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of three years, and in relation to the second count to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years. These sentences were directed to be served concurrently and to date from 23 May 2003, that being the first date on which the applicant went into custody. The applicant was also disqualified from driving for a period of five years.  
     
      
    2 The applicant now seeks leave to appeal in respect of the non-parole period which was fixed for the first count, upon the ground that his Honour erred in declining to find special circumstances and in failing to reduce the non-parole period accordingly. In the event of that application being successful and leading to a reduction of the non-parole period, it is contended that the fixed term for the second count should be similarly reduced. 
     
      
       
      The Facts 
       
      
    3 The offences were committed on the morning of 6 May 2002. The applicant was the driver of a motor vehicle which was travelling on the M4 motorway. There were four passengers in the vehicle, one in the front passenger seat and three in the rear. All the occupants of the vehicle were young students and they were friends.  
     
      
    4 In the period leading up to the accident the applicant was observed to overtake traffic, and for that purpose to change lanes, on many occasions. He was also observed to be driving at speeds well in excess of the 110 kph speed limit, at times up to 160 kph. He was asked by two passengers, on four separate occasions, to slow down but he did not do so, save for a brief period when he came upon a marked police vehicle. He resumed speeding once that vehicle left the motorway.  
     
      
    5 When he approached the Roper Road exit, he changed from lane 3 to lane 1, without indicating. When he found a truck in the lane, he moved in to the breakdown lane, at a speed in excess of the speed limit, in order to overtake it. Tragically there was, in the breakdown lane ahead of his vehicle, a Penrith Council truck with its hazard lights activated, as well as the truck of a tyre fitter who was attending to a blown out tyre on the Council truck. The applicant attempted to avoid these vehicles but was unable to do so. In the collision that followed, a female passenger in the rear seat of his vehicle was killed, and the passenger in the front seat suffered serious injuries. 
     
      
    6 The applicant suffered neck and back injuries, as well as lesser injuries, and there was medical evidence available to suggest that he is at risk of suffering neck problems for the rest of his life which are likely to worsen as he ages. 
     
      
    7 His Honour’s objective findings in relation to the two offences, including his finding that the applicant had abandoned responsibility for safe driving, are unimpeachable. In substance he found that the applicant had: 
     
      
       
      (a) driven in an erratic and aggressive manner for a distance of at least 4 km and in fact for sometime before that; 
       
       
      (b) travelled well in excess of the speed limit, and at a time above 150 kph, and in a situation where he had been overtaking vehicles on the left-hand side, and at least on one occasion prior to the actual collision, by moving into the breakdown lane; 
       
       
      (c) ignored requests from his passengers to slow down; 
       
       
      (d) driven in such a way that he placed a significant number of people at risk, not only the people in his vehicle but also the other users of the motorway, including persons on foot in the vicinity of the council truck; 
       
       
      (e) engaged in such a degree of erratic and aggressive driving such that the only conclusion open was that he was engaged in competition driving or was showing off to the other occupants of his vehicle. 
       
      
    8 Subjectively, the applicant was aged 20 years at the time of the accident, and was the eldest in a wholly supportive family. He had done well at school, was studying at university, and had available a number of very favourable character references. He had no prior criminal convictions but he did have a poor driving record, which had seen him fined several times for negligent driving, improper overtaking, and for speeding. His licence had been suspended during the year 2000, and at the time of the current offences, he had been given notice of a further suspension of his licence which was due to commence in 12 days time. 
     
      
    9 He had pleaded guilty following negotiations which led to the first count being reduced from one of manslaughter. For the utilitarian value of that plea he had been given a discount of 20 per cent. His Honour accepted that there was evidence of genuine contrition and that it was unlikely that upon release the applicant would ever re-offend. His Honour expressly took into account each of the matters mentioned, along with the fact of his own injuries, and the opinions of two psychologists which confirmed that the applicant did not have any drug or alcohol related issues or previous psychiatric issues, but that he was now exhibiting symptoms of depression and anxiety. In that regard, his Honour noted that Ms Robilliard considered that ongoing psychotherapy might assist him to continue working towards a more realistic undertaking or acceptance of his role in this tragic accident. 
     
      
    10 In determining the sentences to be imposed his Honour appropriately made reference to the decision in Regina v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 which reformulated the Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 guideline. The present case had several of the features of the typical case there considered, in so far as the applicant was a young offender of good character, who had demonstrated genuine remorse, and insofar as there was a plea of guilty. It differed from that case in that there was more than one victim, the victims were not strangers, and the applicant suffered injuries himself. However these are not material differences. 
     
      
    11 As Whyte makes clear, a custodial sentence will normally be appropriate in such a case, unless the offender has a low-level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement. The present is not such a case of low moral culpability, it being one where there were present a large number of the aggravating factors referred to in Whyte, namely, those that fall within the following enumerated categories: 
     
      
       
      (i) the injuries inflicted to one victim were fatal and to another very serious; 
       
       
      (ii) a large number of people were put at risk, not only the occupants of the vehicle, but other road users; 
       
       
      (iii) the speed was significantly excessive; 
       
       
      (v) the driving was both erratic and dangerous; 
       
       
      (vi) it involved competitive driving or showing off; 
       
       
      (vii) the others were exposed to risk for a considerable period; 
       
       
      (viii) express warnings from concerned passengers were ignored. 
       
      
    12 The only missing aggravating factors were those involved in the following categories: 
     
      
       
      (iv) intoxication or substance abuse; 
       
       
      (ix) escaping police pursuit; 
       
       
      (x) driving with sleep deprivation; and 
       
       
      (xi) failing to stop. 
       
      
    13 The factors that were present clearly establish, as his Honour found, a high degree of moral culpability. 
     
      
    14 As such, it was appropriate for his Honour to have had regard, by way of a check or sounding board or guide, although not as a rule or presumption, to the following passages in Whyte: 
     
      
       
        
         
        229 The guideline for offences against s52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        230 In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        231 In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s52A, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment. 
        
       
       
        
        232 The guideline is, to reiterate, a “guide” or a “check”. The sentence imposed in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all of the factors required to be taken into account by s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
        
       
       
        
        233 This guideline focuses attention on the objective circumstances of the offence. The subjective circumstances of the offender also require consideration. For the reasons I have given above, when discussing the proportionality cases, particularly  
        Dodd 
        , this approach reflects the principle of proportionality as discussed in those cases. No submission was made to this Court that the new s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act inserted by the 2002 Act, affects this line of authority. 
        
       
       
        
        234 Insofar as this guideline involves a “two step” approach to sentencing it is, in my opinion, as a “check” for the reasons given above, consistent with an ultimate decision that involves the exercise of a broad discretion, sometimes referred to as an instinctive synthesis. 
         
        
       
      
    15 The present application essentially turns upon his Honour’s finding that this was not a case where there were special circumstances that would justify a departure from the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence specified in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    16 Section 44 relevantly provided as follows at the time of the offence and for sentencing purposes thereafter (including on appeal): 
     
      
       
        
        44(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an 
         
        offence, a court is required: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision. 
        
       
      
    17 In relation to special circumstances, Dodd DCJ observed: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Walsh has submitted on your behalf that I should find special circumstances, and, while it is open to me to find special circumstances on the basis of your age, the fact that this is your first time in prison and that you will have good prospects of rehabilitation and no doubt need at least some assistance on your release from prison in terms of readjust into your life outside prison, I have come to the conclusion that  
        there is overall no good reason for extending the period which you would otherwise spend on parole following release from prison  
        and therefore I intend to fix the non-parole period to the head sentence in the ratio of three-quarters.  
        [Emphasis added.] 
        
       
      
    18 That passage is impugned on appeal as involving error of law. 
     
      
    19 The proper approach in relation to the determination of the non-parole period and in relation to the presence or absence of special circumstances is that outlined in Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 by Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, Grove J and Newman AJ agreed). The reference in the following passage is to Power (1974) 131 CLR 623: 
     
      
       
        
        57 The reasoning in  
        Power 
         indicates that it is not appropriate to determine the non-parole period primarily from the perspective of the length of the period of supervision on parole. Indeed, the primary perspective should be the length of the minimum period of actual incarceration. By enacting a provision that only works one way – requiring specific justification for a lower proportion but not for a higher proportion – Parliament has, in my opinion, reinforced this as the primary perspective. This has the effect that the scope of the considerations relevant to the determination of “special circumstances” must encompass the full range of issues which are relevant to the determination of the minimum period of actual incarceration without hope of release on parole. 
        
       
       
        
        58 The length of the non-parole period remains, however, of potential significance. Indeed, the requirements of rehabilitation would be best computed in terms of a period of linear time, not in terms of a fixed per centage of a head sentence. The desirability of a longer than computed period of supervision will be an appropriate approach in many cases. It is not, however, the only perspective. 
        
       
       
        
        59 The words “special circumstances” appear in numerous statutory provisions. They are words of indeterminate reference and will always take their colour from their surroundings. The sentencing context in which they appear in the present legislation must be understood against the background of a long-standing line of decisions in the High Court, commencing with  
        Power 
        , which emphasises that the non-parole period is to be determined by what the sentencing judge concludes that all of the circumstances of the case, including the need for rehabilitation, indicate ought be the minimum period of actual incarceration. The proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely, or primarily, by reason of considerations of rehabilitation has long since been rejected. 
        
       
      
    20 I return now to the passage in Dodd DCJ’s remarks on sentence which I quoted in paragraph [17] of this judgment. Arguably, his Honour’s reasoning involved an error similar to that referred to in Simpson at [57] - [59] (quoted above). On a literal reading of the passage, his Honour was saying that he was precluded from altering the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the sentence because there was no good reason for a longer parole period than the statutory formula produced. Read that way, his Honour regarded himself as precluded, for that reason, from bringing any other consideration to bear which might constitute special circumstances and which might otherwise have made it appropriate to reduce the non-parole period below that which the statutory formula produced.  
     
      
    21 That approach would be erroneous. It would treat the question of whether there was a reason to extend the parole period at the expense of the non-parole period as an over-riding consideration, thereby excluding considerations which might otherwise operate to alter the statutory proportion. In particular, it would exclude such considerations as age and first time in custody, mentioned by his Honour, which might otherwise have been seen as special circumstances warranting a direct reduction in the non-parole period below that produced by the statutory formula. 
     
      
    22 Read liberally, his Honour meant by the words emphasised in the quoted passage that there was no good reason for altering the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the sentence, irrespective of whether the considerations mentioned earlier in the passage constituted special circumstances. A sentencing court may, in the exercise of its discretion, decline to reduce the non-parole period produced by the statutory formula, notwithstanding a finding of special circumstances. Accordingly, the more liberal reading of the passage would involve no error. 
     
      
    23 It is unnecessary, however, to resolve which reading of the passage should be preferred. The appeal should be dismissed for an independent reason. That reason is as follows. 
     
      
    24 Concerning appeals against sentence generally, the Chief Justice said in Simpson:  
     
      
       
        
        79 Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: “If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process.” That is not the statutory formulation. By s6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that “some other sentence, … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to “quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore” is not satisfied. 
        
       
      
    25 Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is explicit in this regard. Relevantly, it provides: 
     
      
       
        
        6(3) On an appeal … against a sentence the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence … less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and i 
        n any other case shall dismiss the appeal 
        .  
        [Emphasis added.] 
        
       
      
    26 Accordingly, where this court is of the opinion that a lesser sentence is not warranted, the court is not required to quash a sentence for error of law, where such error exists, and then proceed to re-sentence the applicant for no lesser a sentence than was imposed at first instance. That would, generally speaking, be an unnecessary waste of the court’s resources. In some such cases, there may be special reason for deciding whether there is error in the sentencing judge’s reasons, such as to decide an unsettled point of legal principle or to emphasise the need to adhere to established principle where that is required. Otherwise, a decision that a lesser sentence is not warranted is sufficient to dispose of an appeal against sentence without more. 
     
      
    27 I am of the opinion that a lesser non-parole period is not warranted in this case in view of the objective features of the case, including the aggravating features which have been mentioned, and notwithstanding the mitigating subjective considerations which have been mentioned and any considerations which might amount to special circumstances. A non-parole period of less than three years would be inadequate, in my view, to reflect the seriousness of the offences in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    28 I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Wood CJ at CL: I have read in draft form the judgment of Sperling J. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour. 
     
      
    2 Sperling J: On 18 June 2001, the appellant stood trial in the District Court on a charge that on 13 October 1999 he robbed a person of a wallet and $150 in cash in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that at the time of the robbery he used corporal violence. 
     
      
       
      The trial 
       
      
    3 The appellant was represented by Ms D Yehia of counsel. She entered a plea on behalf of the appellant that he was not guilty by reason of mental illness. The plea admitted the objective elements of the offence as charged.  
     
      
    4 The appellant had signed an election under s132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, electing to be tried by a judge alone. Other formal requirements were fulfilled. The trial proceeded before Kinchington DCJ without a jury.  
     
      
    5 The Crown case consisted of the tender of the Crown brief and the written election to be tried by judge alone. The brief consisted of witness statements and a report by Dr J F O’Dea, forensic psychiatrist, dated 15 June 2001, following an interview with the appellant on 12 June 2001 at the Silverwater Correctional Complex. The report was prepared at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions. According to Dr O’Dea, the appellant told him that, on the occasion of the offence, the appellant was hearing voices which told him to take the money because it belonged to him, that he did not believe he had done anything wrong, and that he believed it was reasonable for people to take money from each other at automatic teller machines. 
     
      
    6 In Dr O’Dea’s opinion, the appellant was suffering from a severe psychiatric illness, best understood as severe chronic schizophrenic illness, which was characterised by auditory hallucinations, problems with thinking, fatuous affect, disorganised and aggressive behaviour, problems with information processing and poor judgment. Dr O’Dea was doubtful about fitness to be tried which he said might be clarified by his legal representatives. 
     
      
    7 Dr O’Dea also said that the appellant might satisfy the criteria for the mental illness defence. He said it was reasonable to assume that, at the time, the appellant was suffering from significant problems with his thinking and behaviour. It was reasonable to accept that he might not have been able to control his actions or might not have understood that what he was doing in the context of the alleged offence was wrong. 
     
      
    8 The case on behalf of the appellant consisted of a report by Dr O Neilson, forensic psychiatrist, dated 9 May 2001. Dr Neilson had been retained on behalf of the appellant by Sydney Regional Aboriginal Corporation Legal Service. He had interviewed the appellant at the Metropolitan Reception Remand Centre on 4 May 2001. The appellant’s account of the circumstances of the offence as given to Dr Neilson was materially identical with that given to Dr O’Dea. According to Dr Neilson, the appellant told him that voices had told him that it was his money and that he should go and get it, and that the appellant thought, at the time, that the person from whom the money was taken was robbing him.  
     
      
    9 In Dr Neilson’s opinion, the appellant was suffering from a severe and disabling mental illness, at the time of the offence charged, characterised by perceptual disturbances in the form of auditory hallucinations, disorganised and illogical thinking and persecutory delusional beliefs. The condition was consistent with chronic schizophrenia.  
     
      
    10 In Dr Neilson’s opinion, as expressed in the report, the appellant was fit for trial although, he added, the appellant’s counsel might be in a better position to decide that according to the quality of instructions received. At the time of interview, the appellant seemed to Dr Neilson to be able to provide adequate instructions and seemed able to follow the proceedings.  
     
      
    11 It was Dr Neilson’s opinion that the appellant had the defence of mental illness available to him on the ground that, at the time of the offence charged, he was affected by the delusional belief that the money he took was his and that what he was doing was not morally or legally wrong. He was, in Dr Neilson’s opinion, unable to reason with any measure of calmness at the time of the offence, partly because of moderate intoxication, but mainly because of the illogical thinking and emotional arousal caused by acute mental illness. 
     
      
       
      Verdict and order 
       
      
    12 On 19 June 2001, Kinchington DCJ delivered judgment. His Honour noted, correctly, that the facts of the case were not in dispute. He reviewed the evidence that the victim had been struck on the head and knocked to the ground by the appellant who took the victim’s wallet and $150 in cash before running off. The victim had chased and caught the appellant, recovering the wallet and the money after a scuffle. The appellant had run off again. However, the appellant had lost his credit card in the scuffle, which the victim picked up and handed in to the investigating police who traced the appellant and arrested him.  
     
      
    13 Necessarily, his Honour found the objective elements of the offence proved.  
     
      
    14 His Honour then turned to the matter of mental illness. He referred to the reports by Dr O’Dea and Dr Neilson. His Honour found that the appellant was fit to stand trial.  
     
      
    15 As to the defence of mental illness, his Honour was not satisfied that the necessary mental element in the offence charged had been established because (as he put it) he was not satisfied that the appellant was able to control his actions or understood that what he was doing in the context was wrong in either a moral or a legal sense. 
     
      
    16 His Honour proceeded to return a special verdict that the appellant was not guilty by reason of mental illness. He then ordered that the appellant be detained in the psychiatric ward at Long Bay Correctional Centre or such other place as the Mental Health Review Tribunal should direct until his release was approved in accordance with the law.  
     
      
       
      Notice of appeal and grounds of appeal 
       
      
    17 On 18 October 2003, the appellant filed a notice of intention to appeal. The notice was dated 2 October 2003. It was substantially out of time. 
     
      
    18 The grounds of appeal accompanying the notice of appeal were that the appellant had been denied justice pursuant to the Australian Constitution. The appellant raised other constitutional law arguments. These grounds of appeal were not referred to by the appellant on the hearing of the appeal. They have no merit in law.  
     
      
    19 After filing the notice of intention to appeal, the appellant notified further grounds. These can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) That the appellant was unfit to be tried; 
       
       
      (2) That the plea of not guilty on the ground of mental illness was entered contrary to his instructions; 
       
       
      (3) That he was not guilty of the offence because he was not there. 
       
       
      The legislation 
       
       
      Fitness to be tried 
       
      
    20 The relevant provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 are as follows. Section 5 provides that the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence may be raised by any party to the proceedings in respect of the offence or by the court. Section 7 provides that the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried should be raised before the person is arraigned but may be raised at any time during the course of the hearing of the proceedings. Section 10 provides that if (following the question being raised before the person is arraigned) the Attorney General determines that an enquiry should be conducted or the question is raised after arraignment, the court is to conduct an enquiry to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried. 
     
      
    21 Section 13 provides that, if, following an enquiry, an accused person is found fit to be tried, the proceedings go on in the ordinary way. If, on the other hand, the accused person is found unfit to be tried, the proceedings are not to continue and the court must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Pursuant to s16, if (as is usually the case) the Tribunal determines that a person will not, within 12 months, become fit to be tried, the Tribunal is to notify the Attorney General of that determination. Pursuant to s18, the Attorney General may then direct that a special hearing be conducted. 
     
      
    22 Section 19 provides that, at a special hearing, the person is to be acquitted unless it can be proved that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative. Pursuant to s21, at a special hearing, the accused person is to be taken to have pleaded not guilty and may, by counsel, raise any defence that could be properly raised if the special hearing were an ordinary trial. Pursuant to s22, the verdicts available at a special hearing include not guilty, not guilty on the ground of mental illness, or that, on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged or an available alternative offence. 
     
      
    23 Section 22(2) provides that a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness, found at a special hearing, is to be taken to be equivalent to a special verdict that an accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness under s38 of the Act. Pursuant to s25, if, at a special hearing, the defence of mental illness is raised and there is a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the person is thereafter to be dealt with as if there had been a special verdict at a normal trial of criminal proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness 
       
      
    24 The foregoing reference to a “special verdict” is a reference to s38 of the Act. That section provides that, if on the trial for an offence, it is given in evidence that a person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time, then, if it appears that the person did the act or made the omission charged but was mentally ill at the time, a special verdict must be returned that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.  
     
      
    25 A person is entitled to the defence of mental illness where the M’Naghten rules apply: Re M'Naghten's Case (1843) 10 Cl & Fin 200, 210: 
     
      
       
        
        [T]o establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was acting under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong. 
        
       
      
    26 Section 39 provides that, following such a special verdict, the court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order as the court considers appropriate. (It is unnecessary to mention the consequence of other verdicts available at a special hearing.) 
     
      
       
      Trial by judge alone 
       
      
    27 Provision for trial by judge alone is made by s132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The section provides, in relation to proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court, that a person must be tried by the judge alone if the person has so elected in accordance with the section and the judge is satisfied that the person, before making the election, sought and received advice in relation to the election from a barrister or solicitor. The section further provides that an election may be made only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions and before the date fixed for the person’s trial.  
     
      
       
      Right of appeal 
       
      
    28 Section 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a person convicted on indictment may appeal against the person’s conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The section further provides that a person acquitted on the ground of mental illness, where mental illness was not set up as a defence by the person, shall be deemed to be a person convicted.  
     
      
    29 Where a plea of mental illness is entered (or even where the defence of mental illness is raised as an alternative, following a plea of not guilty), no appeal lies against a special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness: Foy (1922) 38 WN (NSW) 20; Grieg (1996) 89 A Crim R 254. 
     
      
    30 Section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that, on an appeal against conviction, the court shall allow the appeal if it is of the opinion that on any ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      Evidence on appeal 
       
       
      The appellant’s evidence 
       
      
    31 The appellant represented himself at the hearing of the appeal. He gave evidence at the hearing. He said that, at an earlier time, he was hearing voices which told him that the Kudachi man was going to make everything alright. They told him what the Kudachi man said. The doctors and possibly the solicitors were working against the Kudachi man. 
     
      
    32 In cross-examination, the appellant said that the solicitor, Mr Cameron, was an agent for the devil. He denied that he told Mr Cameron and Ms Yehia that he wanted to raise mental illness as a defence. He said in that regard that they were working for the demons. 
     
      
    33 The appellant said he did not recall talking to Mr Edwards. He did not recall being interviewed by Dr Neilson.  
     
      
    34 He recalled speaking with Ms Yehia. The appellant did not respond directly to the suggestion that she explained to him that he could plead guilty or not guilty. He said that he thought she could read his mind and that he was talking to her with his mind. He said that was how they were communicating. Asked further about his conversation with Ms Yehia on 27 March 2001, the appellant said that he was not involved in the alleged offence, that he was not there. Asked further about instructions to plead not guilty on the ground of mental illness, the appellant’s answers were not responsive. He disagreed that he had accepted that he suffered from schizophrenia when under treatment prior to trial. He disagreed that he appeared to be pleased with Dr Neilson’s opinion at the meeting with Ms Yehia on 29 May 2001. 
     
      
    35 The appellant said he did not recall Ms Yehia explaining the election to be tried by a judge alone. He denied that Ms Yehia explained to him that if he was found not guilty by reason of mental illness he would not receive a set sentence. Asked about his admission to Ms Yehia that he took the money, the appellant said that he did not disagree with that assertion because the voices told him to say that he had done it. Again, he said that he thought he was talking to her with his mind.  
     
      
    36 Concerning his treatment before trial, the appellant said that the voices told him what to say to the doctor. 
     
      
       
      Conference 27 March 2001 
       
      
    37 Ms D Yehia, who appeared as counsel for the appellant at the trial, gave evidence on the appeal by affidavits sworn on 23 and 30 March 2004, and orally. 
     
      
    38 In her affidavit evidence, Ms Yehia said that she advised the appellant of the crown case against him and read to him the statements which were subsequently tendered in evidence at the trial. According to her, the appellant agreed that he had taken the money but said that he was under the influence of a spell of the Kudachi man at the time. She then advised him that if he accepted the facts alleged, he could plead guilty and that if he denied them he could plead not guilty. According to her, the appellant himself raised the option of relying on mental illness to explain his behaviour. She explained that, before she could advise in relation to that possibility, it would be necessary to have a psychiatric assessment. 
     
      
    39 Ms Yehia said that she did not observe any sign of delusion or mental illness at this conference. She said he appeared to understand the court process and the options of pleading guilty or not guilty. She said she believed he was fit to instruct her in relation to the trial. 
     
      
    40 Mr T Edwards, a solicitor employed by the Aboriginal Legal Service, was present at that conference. His notes in relation to the conference were in evidence on the appeal. His notes include, 
     
      
       
        
        Delusional at the time … Wants to run mental illness defence … Spell from 1998. Seeing ghosts. Kudachi man used to wake him in the morning and spin him around. Wishes to plead N.G.  
        [not guilty] 
         due to mental illness. Admitted involvement in offence but delusional at the time. 
        
       
       
      Conference 24 April 2001 
       
      
    41 Mr A Cameron, another solicitor employed with the Aboriginal Legal Service, said, in his affidavit sworn on 31 March 2004, that he attended this conference with Ms Yehia. According to him the appellant said on that occasion that he was under a spell of the Kudachi man and confirmed that he wanted to raise mental illness as a defence. He said that was consistent with the previous instructions taken by Mr T Edwards, whose notes relating to the conference on 27 March 2001 were annexed to Mr Cameron’s affidavit. 
     
      
    42 He then arranged the psychiatric assessment by Dr Neilson. 
     
      
       
      Conference 29 May 2001 
       
      
    43 Ms Yehia said in her affidavit evidence that she attended this conference with Ms P Dwyer, another solicitor employed by the Aboriginal Legal Service. She said she explained the content of Dr Neilson’s report to the appellant who appeared pleased that Dr Neilson supported a finding of not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
    44 Ms Yehia said that she did not observe any sign of delusional thinking at this conference. She said that she formed the view that, although the appellant was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the offence and continued to do so, he was capable of giving her instructions. 
     
      
    45 Ms Yehia went on to say that she advised the appellant to elect to be tried by a judge alone, that she explained the necessary form to him, that he appeared to understand the choice and that he signed the form, which was witnessed by Ms Dwyer. Ms Yehia said that she explained to the appellant that if he was found not guilty by reason of mental illness he would not receive a set sentence but would be supervised by the Mental Health Review Tribunal and it would be up to them to recommend his release; in the meantime he would be held in a psychiatric ward. Ms Yehia said that following that explanation, the appellant confirmed his instructions to plead the defence of mental illness. 
     
      
    46 A copy of the signed election form for trial by a judge alone was annexed to Mr Cameron’s affidavit. 
     
      
       
      Ms Yehia, oral evidence on appeal 
       
      
    47 Ms Yehia was cross-examined by the appellant. The appellant challenged her evidence concerning his election to be tried by a judge alone. She affirmed her evidence. She denied the appellant’s suggestion that she and the appellant had communicated by mind. Asked whether the appellant understood everything, she affirmed her evidence that he appeared to understand what they were talking about.  
     
      
       
      Mr Cameron, oral evidence on appeal 
       
      
    48 Mr Cameron also denied the appellant’s suggestion that he and the appellant had communicated by mind. 
     
      
       
      Dr Neilson 
       
      
    49 Dr Neilson’s report of 9 May 2001, which followed an interview with the appellant on 4 May 2001, was before this Court on the appeal as part of the record of the trial. I have referred earlier to the content of that report.  
     
      
    50 No evidence by Dr Neilson had been filed by the Crown in the matter of the appeal. Accordingly, he was called, in effect, by the appellant. Dr Neilson said he was not aware of the appellant experiencing voices at the time of his interview with the appellant on 4 May 2001. He said that the appellant told him that the treatment he was receiving had stopped the voices. Dr Neilson said that he understood the appellant had recovered from the illness which he had at the time of the alleged offence.  
     
      
    51 In re-examination, Dr Neilson agreed that a more recent exacerbation of the illness could affect memory or information retrieval concerning earlier events, such as what transpired at the interview in May 2001. 
     
      
       
      Dr O’Dea’s evidence 
       
      
    52 Dr O’Dea’s report of 15 June 2001, which followed an interview with the appellant on 12 June 2001, was before this Court on the appeal as part of the record of the trial. I have referred earlier to the content of that report. 
     
      
    53 As in the case of Dr Neilson, Dr O’Dea was, in effect, called as a witness by the appellant. Dr O’Dea affirmed that in his opinion the appellant had been under treatment for a genuine mental illness. Asked whether a belief that he could communicate with his mind made him unfit to be tried, Dr O’Dea affirmed his written evidence that he had concerns about that but thought it was for others to decide. In re-examination Dr O’Dea affirmed his written evidence that the appellant’s legal representatives had been in the best position to decide the question of fitness to be tried. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
       
      Appeal out of time 
       
      
    54 It is reasonable to assume that the appellant’s mental illness contributed to the delay in instituting this appeal. Accordingly, the time for filing the notice of appeal should be extended to the date of filing, 18 October 2003.  
     
      
       
      Jurisdiction 
       
      
    55 The Crown submits that the appeal is incompetent on the ground that no appeal lies against a special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness where the defence was raised at the trial by the appellant. The Crown says that the plea of not guilty on the ground of mental illness was entered by the appellant’s counsel on his behalf. The appellant says, in effect, that this was not so because he did not authorise the plea.  
     
      
    56 As appears below, I would resolve that issue of fact in favour of the Crown. In consequence, the appeal is incompetent and must be dismissed. However, in deference to the appellant’s arguments, I will also review the appeal on its merits. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: that the appellant was unfit to be tried 
       
      
    57 At the time of trial in June 2001, the appellant’s counsel, Ms Yehia, was a barrister of 12 years’ standing, with considerable experience in the field of criminal law. She was in the best position to assess whether the appellant was fit to be tried. She adverted to this question and formed the opinion that he was.  
     
      
    58 Nothing has emerged on the hearing of the appeal to show that Ms Yehia’s opinion was wrong. Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: that the plea of guilty on the ground of mental illness was entered contrary to the appellant’s instructions 
       
      
    59 The evidence of Ms Yehia, Mr Edwards’s note and the evidence of Mr Cameron are to the contrary. The burden of that evidence is that it was the appellant himself who wished to raise the defence of mental illness and that he adhered to that instruction following receipt of Dr Neilson’s report and having had that report and the implications of the plea explained to him.  
     
      
    60 I do not doubt that the appellant gave informed instructions to his legal representatives to plead the defence of mental illness. Accordingly, this ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: that the appellant was not guilty of the offence because he was not there 
       
      
    61 The plea of not guilty on the ground of mental illness admitted the objective facts of the offence charged, including the involvement of the appellant. As indicated above, that plea was entered on the appellant’s informed instructions. Additionally, the evidence adduced at the trial established that the appellant was the person involved.  
     
      
    62 In these circumstances, there is no basis on which it can be contended that the finding of the appellant’s involvement was not reasonably open to his Honour and should not have been made. Accordingly, this ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
       
      Appellant not mentally ill 
       
      
    63 Although not raised as a formal ground of appeal, the tenor of the appellant’s evidence and argument on the appeal was that he was not mentally ill at the time of the offence charged and that the evidence of Dr O’Dea and Dr Neilson to that effect was incorrect and knowingly false. 
     
      
    64 Nothing has emerged at the hearing of the appeal to establish the appellant’s contentions in this regard.  
     
      
    65 Accordingly, no such ground of appeal has been made out. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion and orders 
       
      
    66 For the reasons given above, the appeal fails for want of jurisdiction and on its merits. 
     
      
    67 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Time for appeal extended to 18 October 2003.  
       
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    68 Kirby J: I agree with Sperling J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 The Court: This appeal came on for hearing on 13 April 2004. The Crown appealed against sentences imposed on the respondent in the Drug Court of New South Wales by Barnett DCJ on 20 November 2003. 
     
      
    2 The Court was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Because the respondent was due to be released from prison on 14 April 2004 under the sentences as imposed at first instance, we made orders dismissing the appeal and directing that the respondent be released from prison on that date. Our reasons for that decision follow. 
     
      
    3 In relation to 12 offences, committed on nine separate occasions, the effective sentence was two years and two months with a non-parole period of eight months. The offences consisted of nine property offences and two offences of possessing a prohibited drug. Additionally, a fine of $100 was confirmed for one offence of giving a false name. 
     
      
       
      The Drug Court Act 1998 
       
      
    4 The scheme of the legislation involves the admission of offenders to a Drug Court programme, the imposition of suspended sentences (called “initial sentences”), and provision for reassessment of the initial sentences by way of final sentences if the programme is terminated for the particular offender. 
     
      
    5 Section 12(1) provides that, on termination of the drug offender’s programme, the Drug Court must reconsider the drug offender’s initial sentence or sentences.  
     
      
    6 Section 12(2) provides that, in reconsidering the initial sentence or sentences, the Drug Court must take into consideration certain specified matters including the nature of the drug offender’s participation in his or her programme.  
     
      
    7 Section 12(3) provides that, after considering a drug offender’s initial sentence or sentences, the Drug Court is to determine the drug offender’s final sentence either by setting aside the initial sentence or sentences and re-sentencing the offender in the ordinary way or by making an order confirming the original sentence or sentences.  
     
      
    8 Section 12(4) provides that a final sentence for an offence is not to be greater than the initial sentence imposed in relation to that offence. 
     
      
       
      Initial sentences imposed on 24 December 2002 
       
      
    9 The facts relating to these offences were as follows. 
     
      
       
      Count 1: break enter and steal 18 March 2002 
       
       
      On 18 March 2002, premises were entered at Guildford. A sliding door at the side of the house had had a fly screen removed. A side window was smashed and the offender entered a room which was locked, entered a manhole in the ceiling and smashed the gyprock above the bedroom where he obtained a large amount of jewellery and a handbag. Property in excess of $8000 was taken. The respondent was identified by fingerprints. 
       
       
      Count 2: attempt break enter 23 February 2002 
       
       
      On 23 March 2002, the respondent was seen at some units jumping from the first floor balcony by the owner. Fingerprints at the scene were matched with his and he was charged with attempt to break and enter. 
       
       
      Counts 3, 4 and 5: possess prohibited drug 7 May 2002; break and enter with intent 7 May 2002 (two counts) 
       
       
      On 7 May 2002, the respondent smashed the rear ground floor window of unit 1 at Casula, climbed through and searched for property. He removed a manhole cover and gained access to the roof by removing tiles. He gained access to unit 2, which was vacant. He was spoken to by police walking away from the unit, and had cannabis in his possession. He admitted having entered the units with intent to steal. 
       
       
      Count 6: steal property in dwelling house 8 May 2002 
       
       
      On 8 or 9 May 2002, the respondent stole property from a dwelling house at which he was working with his brother-in-law who was contracted to paint the premises. The respondent stole jewellery in excess of $5000, a cheque and a wallet. The jewellery was located but the other property was not. 
       
       
      Counts 7and 8: give false name 19 May 2002; possess prohibited drug 19 May 2002 
       
       
      On 19 May 2002, the respondent was seen by police in a motor vehicle and gave a false name. He had drugs on his person. 
       
       
      Count 9: goods in custody 22 October 2002 
       
       
      On 22 October 2002, the respondent was seen by police with a camcorder which was suspected of being stolen. 
       
       
      Count 10: possess prohibited drug 29 October 2002 
       
       
      On 29 October 2002, the respondent was seen by police and had cannabis in his possession. 
       
       
      Sentences 
       
      
    10 The property offences mentioned above were dealt with summarily by Milson DCJ. The maximum sentence on summary conviction for each such offence was two years’ imprisonment or a fine or both.  
     
      
    11 The maximum sentence for the drug offences dealt with on that occasion was imprisonment for two years and for the offence of giving a false name a fine of $220.  
     
      
    12 The initial sentences imposed for these offences were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Counts 1, 2, 4 & 5 
         imprisonment for 12 months 
         
         
         Counts 3, 8 & 10 
         imprisonment for one month 
         
         
         Count 6 
         imprisonment for one year ten months and one week 
         
         
         Count 7 
         fined $100 
         
         
         Count 9 
         imprisonment for six months 
         
        
       
      
    13 The sentences were suspended for the duration of the respondent’s Drug Court programme. His Honour said that the sentences would be served concurrently but for suspension.  
     
      
       
      Initial sentence imposed on 5 May 2003 
       
      
    14 The facts relating to the offence dealt with on this occasion were as follows. 
     
      
      Count 11: break and enter with intent 27 February 2003 
       
       
      On 27 February 2003, at about 9:30 am the respondent entered the premises at Cabramatta and bent back the screen door to open it. He then kicked the wooden door off its hinges and entered the premises. The owner returned and saw him there. He fled and was arrested by police nearby. 
       
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    15 This matter was dealt with on indictment before Milson DCJ. The maximum sentence was imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    16 The initial sentence imposed for this offence was imprisonment for two years, to be served consecutively at the expiration of the sentence in relation to count 6. 
     
      
    17 Again, the sentence was suspended for the duration of the Drug Court programme.  
     
      
       
      Sentences imposed on 20 November 2003 
      
    18 These are the sentences which are now the subject of appeal by the Crown. 
     
      
    19 The sentences include final sentences on reassessment of the initial sentences imposed on 24 December 2002 in relation to counts 1-10, a final sentence on reassessment of the initial sentence imposed on 5 May 2003 in relation to count 11, and a sentence for the new offence in relation to count 12 (for which there was no prior initial sentence). 
     
      
    20 The sentences imposed on 24 December 2002 and 5 May 2003 were initial sentences within the meaning of s12. Accordingly, when dealing with the respondent on 20 November 2003, the Drug Court was precluded by s12(4) from imposing final sentences in relations to counts 1-11 exceeding the respective sentences initially imposed for those offences.  
     
      
    21 The court was also precluded from increasing the effective aggregate sentence one year ten months and one week in relation to counts 1-10 by disturbing the element of concurrence to which I have referred: Toman [2004] NSWCCA 31.  
     
      
    22 Similarly, when reconsidering the initial sentence imposed on 5 May 2003 in relation to count 11, the Drug Court was precluded from imposing a final sentence in excess of two years. 
     
      
    23 This court is subject to the same constraints: Toman. 
     
      
    24 Count 12 was, and is, in a different category. There was no initial sentence in relation to that offence. Section 12(4) did not apply. Accordingly, the respondent was to be sentenced for the offence in relation to that count under ordinary sentencing principles unaffected by anything in the Drug Court Act.25 The larceny offence to which count 12 relates was dealt with summarily on 20 November 2003. On summary conviction, the maximum penalty for that offence was imprisonment for one year or a fine or both.26 The facts relating to the new offence were as follows. 
     
      
       
      Count 12: larceny 16 August 2003 
       
       
      On 16 August 2003, the respondent was found in a luggage compartment of a bus by the driver and he ran away. He was chased by the driver and an off duty police officer and captured. He had in his possession the bus driver’s wallet and two cheque books, one in the name of the bus driver and one in the name of the coach company. He admitted that he had stolen the property and that he intended using the proceeds to buy drugs. He was taken to the police station and made full admissions. 
       
       
      Subjective considerations 
       
      
    27 It was now necessary for Barnett DCJ to take into account the full array of subjective considerations bearing on the sentencing process. 
     
      
    28 A further offence, committed while on the Drug Court programme, was relevant as a matter of history. On 20 June 2003, the respondent committed the offence of having goods in custody. He was dealt with in the Local Court on 11 July 2003. 
     
      
    29 Following the offence committed on 27 February 2003, the respondent was found eligible to remain in the programme despite the breach. However, when he was arrested on 16 August 2003, following the offence committed on that date, his Drug Court programme was terminated. The respondent then remained in custody until 20 November 2003 when the final sentences were imposed. 
     
      
    30 In his remarks on sentence of 20 November 2003, Barnett DCJ acknowledged positive subjective considerations. He noted the contents of various reports indicating that the respondent was easily led, suffered depression, possessed low average intelligence, that he was supported by his family and had expressed remorse. 
     
      
    31 The respondent was young at the time of final sentence being then 20 years of age. Prior to the sentences imposed on 20 November 2003 he had never been sentenced to a term of imprisonment although he had served time in custody, as we have mentioned. His Honour found special circumstances. 
     
      
    32 There was only one matter on the respondent’s record prior to those dealt with by the Drug Court which was dealt with in the Children’s Court and for which a community service order was imposed. 
     
      
    33 The respondent had been in custody in relation to certain of these offences for some 55 days before entering the Drug Court programme. He had also served some 83 days in custody since commencement of the programme for sanctions and otherwise, a total of some 138 days or approximately four and half months. The sentences imposed on 20 November 2003 took that time in custody into account. Additionally, there were conditions impinging on freedom of movement and action during the currency of the programme. 
     
      
       
      The sentences 
       
      
    34 Barnett DCJ dealt with the offences in two groups. In relation to counts 1-10, the final sentences were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Counts 1, 2, 4 & 5 
         Imprisonment for 12 months to date from 16 August 2003 and expire 15 August 2004Non-parole period of six months to expire 15 February 2004 
         
         
         Counts 3, 8 & 10 
         Imprisonment for one month to date from 16 August 2003 and expire 15 September 2003 
         
         
         Count 6 
         Imprisonment for 16 months to date from 16 August 2003 and expire 15 December 2004Non-parole period of six months to expire 15 February 2004 
         
         
         Count 7 
         Fine of $100 confirmed 
         
         
         Count 9 
         Imprisonment for six months to date from 16 August 2003 and expire 15 February 2004 
         
        
       
      
    35 It may be noted that all the sentences of imprisonment in this set commenced on 16 August 2003 (the date on which the applicant was taken into custody following the offence in relation to count 12, bail refused). Accordingly, the sentences in relation to counts 1-5 and 7-10 were subsumed under the sentence for count 6, being imprisonment for one year and four months with a non-parole period of six months. 
     
      
    36 This represented a reduction of six months and one week relative to the initial effective aggregate sentence in relation to counts 1 -10. 
     
      
    37 His Honour then imposed a final sentence in relation to count 11 and a sentence in relation to count 12, as follows. 
     
      
       
        
         
         Count 11 
         Imprisonment for 20 months to date from 15 February 2004 and expire 14 October 2005Non-parole period of two months to expire 14 April 2004 
         
         
         Count 12 
         Imprisonment for two months to date from 15 February 2004 and expire 14 April 2004 
         
        
       
      
    38 It may be noted that the sentences for these counts commenced on the date for expiry of the non-parole period under the first group of sentences. 
     
      
    39 The final sentence in relation to count 11 represented a reduction of four months relative to the initial sentence in relation to that count. 
     
      
    40 The aggregate effective sentence for all sentences imposed on 20 November 2003, was two years and two months with a non-parole period of eight months. 
     
      
    41 It may be noted however that the sentence in relation to count 12 added nothing to the effective aggregate sentence in relation to counts 1-11. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    42 The principles relating to appeals by the Crown against sentence were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42, at [70]: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown contends that not only was the sentence imposed inadequate on its face, but also that the sentencing judge made a number of errors of principle in determining that it was appropriate to proceed under s 19B of the  
        Crimes Act 1914 
        . Before considering these submissions it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King  
        (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen  
        (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait  
        (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen  
        (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen  
        (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker  
        [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons”: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen 
         (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62, and  
        Wong & Leung v The Queen  
        at para 109. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
        R v Papazis 
         (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at para 110. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston  
        (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         at para 62. 
        
       
      
    43 The appeal was against the sentences imposed on 20 November 2003. There was no appeal against the sentences imposed on 24 December 2002 and 5 May 2003. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case on appeal 
       
      
    44 It was submitted that the sentences imposed on 20 November 2003 in the first category (counts 1-11) were manifestly inadequate in failing to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences with particular regard to the sentence imposed in relation to count 11. It was submitted that insufficient regard was had to the fact that this was an offence committed during the programme, demonstrating, it was said, a continuing attitude of disobedience, a need for special and general deterrence and for public protection. Further, in relation to that count, it was said that the non-parole period of two months in relation to a sentence of one year and eight months was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      Respondent’s submissions on appeal 
       
      
    45 On behalf of the respondent, it was submitted that the sentences were not manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of the case.  
     
      
    46 There were also particular reasons, it was said, why this court should decline to intervene in any event. First, it was said that most of the offences concerned were dealt with summarily. The implication was that appeal to this court against those sentences was inapposite. 
     
      
    47 Secondly, the appeal was not instituted until two months and ten days after the sentences were imposed on 20 November 2003. A consequence was that the appeal came on for hearing just one day before the date on which the respondent would be entitled to be released under the regime of sentences which are the subject of appeal. 
     
      
    48 Thirdly, the respondent was well prepared for his anticipated release. The Crown, properly, did not object to an affidavit by the respondent being read in that regard. For the respondent had completed a course in occupational health and safety in preparation for employment. He had completed a short bar attendants’ course. He was attending a course for stress management. He had undertaken tuition in numeracy. He had completed a programme for alcohol and other drug users. He planned to live with his parents when released from prison. He anticipated obtaining employment for a short time with his brother-in-law and then proposed to study at TAFE to obtain formal qualifications as a ceramic tiler, having done such work previously. 
     
      
       
      Decision on appeal 
       
      
    49 The court was not satisfied that the final sentences imposed in relation to counts 1-10 were manifestly inadequate. The non-parole period of six months was the focus of the Crown’s attack. That, however, was fixed after taking into account some four and half months in custody which was not included in the sentences. The total time to be served was, accordingly, approximately ten and a half months. This was lenient but not so inadequate as to be appealable by Crown appeal. 
     
      
    50 The sentence in relation to count 11 had the appearance of inadequacy, particularly in relation to the non parole period of two months. That, however, was to be accounted for because of the weight which his Honour legitimately wished to give to special circumstances. It was preferable to look at the effective aggregate sentence for counts 1-11, which was lenient but, again, not manifestly inadequate. That being the situation, intervention, particularly on a Crown appeal, was not warranted. 
     
      
    51 The criticism in relation to count 12 was valid. As we have recorded, this was a serious and significant offence, which was committed on a separate occasion, but for which no additional penalty was imposed. However, a broader view had again to be taken. We did not regard the effective aggregate sentence in relation to the total suite of sentences imposed on 20 November 2004 as being so manifestly inadequate as to warrant intervention on a Crown appeal. 
     
      
    52 Of the further discretionary considerations mentioned by counsel for the respondent, we gave weight to the delay by the Crown in instituting the appeal with the consequence that, on the eve of the release date, a young offender, who has worked hard at rehabilitation while in prison, was faced with the prospect of having his time in gaol extended. 
     
      
    53 For these reasons, the appeal was dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
        
      (On the question of alternative count. See page 559 of transcript.) 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: In this matter a question has arisen as to whether any viable alternative count arises from the indictment and the evidence given in this case. Each of the accused was arraigned on a charge that between the 8th March 1997 and 24th September 2001 at Newcastle in the State of New South Wales they supplied a drug namely methylamphetamine in an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity for such drug. That is an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 
     
      
    2 The evidence relied upon by the Crown is substantially that of two witnesses called in the Crown's case, being Mr Chapman and Ms Love. They have given evidence that over a period of time, being approximately that in the charge in the indictment, the two accused were involved jointly in the supply of methylamphetamine as a going concern in the Newcastle area. The evidence is in effect that they were purchasing large amounts of amphetamine from Ms Love and on supplying it to various purchasers. The Crown case is that they were substantially involved, in the trafficking of amphetamine over the period in the charge and, if the jury accepted that evidence beyond reasonable doubt, it is clear that the amount would have been far more than a large commercial quantity. 
     
      
    3 There is no dispute that the evidence is such that the jury could find beyond reasonable doubt that the offence set out in the first count in the indictment has been proved, if they were prepared to act upon the evidence of Ms Love, Mr Chapman, and what support they may have in their allegations from the telephone intercept material. However, it seems to me that there is little, if any, objective evidence that would support the particular allegation made by Ms Love and Mr Chapman of the extent of the involvement of the accused in the supply of amphetamine before March 2001. 
     
      
    4 The defence case, although not concluded at this time, is clearly that, although Mr Roberts and Ms Schumacher were involved in the supply of amphetamine in the Newcastle area, that supply was only between March 2001 and September 2001, and was of a scale which was in effect to supply their own wants and needs in relation to their use of amphetamine. In other words, they were principally users of the drug, only casually in the case of Mr Roberts and perhaps more frequently in the case of Ms Schumacher, and that in the course of their own use of the drug it was supplied between themselves, to Ms Schumacher's sister, and perhaps by Ms Schumacher to other persons in order to support her habit. Mr Roberts gave evidence to that effect and it was unchallenged by counsel for Ms Schumacher. 
     
      
    5 It seems to me, therefore, that it is open to the jury to find that they have a doubt about the Crown case so far as it relies upon the evidence of indemnified witnesses. It is further open that on the evidence of Mr Roberts a doubt arises as to whether or not the accused were involved in a large commercial quantity in respect of that drug, but that they were nonetheless involved in the supply of amphetamine to the extent of the evidence given by Mr Roberts and revealed in the taped conversations. 
     
      
    6 In light of these competing accounts of the conduct of the accused over the relevant period, the question arises as to what, if any, alternative count should be left to the jury. My attention has been drawn to the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v King [2004] NSWCCA 20. It seems to me that the following propositions can be derived from that decision: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · In any criminal prosecution, the trial judge is required to leave an alternative and lesser count to the jury where there is a viable case to support that lesser charge arising; 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · The alternative count should be left to the jury regardless of whether or not the defence counsel seeks such a count to be placed before the jury; 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · The trial judge should not leave such an alternative where it would give rise to unfairness to the accused to do so, for example where the existence of the alternative count was not raised before the addresses by the parties occurred; 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · The trial judge is not required to put every conceivable alternative count before the jury and should not do so where on a serious charge the technically available alternative is so trivial that it might distract the jury or where there is no question that the offence charged was committed and the issue is whether it was the accused who committed it. 
     
      
    7 There are statements that the trial judge should not of his or her own initiative raise an alternative count where it has not been opened by the Crown. See R v Cameron [1983] 2 NSWLR 66. In King, Smart AJ reviews extensively the authorities concerning the obligation on a trial judge to leave an alternative count regardless of the views of the parties. With respect, I agree with Smart AJ that the trial judge must leave a viable alternative count to the jury where the interests of justice require it, even though the parties have either not sought an alternative verdict or have disclaimed such an alternative count and wish to conduct the trial on an all or nothing basis. 
     
      
    8 Although generally speaking it is for the Crown to raise the issue of an alternative count and should if possible do so in opening, there are cases where the viability of the alternative count may not be apparent on the Crown case. If the alternative is open on the evidence, and if it is in the interests of justice that it be left to the jury, then, so it seems to me, the trial judge has an obligation to raise it with the parties before addresses and may be required to leave it to the jury even though urged not to do so by the parties. 
     
      
    9 In the present case it is clear that an alternative scenario arises, at least from the telephone calls and particularly in light of the evidence of Mr Roberts, than that which the Crown relies upon to support the charge in the first count. That alternative scenario gives rise to an offence of supplying amphetamine contrary to s 25(1) of the Act. It is a scenario, which, at least on the accused Roberts’s case, involves repeated acts of supply by him and Ms Schumacher. Although not nearly as serious as the offence with which they are charged, it could hardly be described as trivial and is one that is appropriate for trial by jury and for punishment on indictment if they are convicted. 
     
      
    10 Although an argument was originally mounted before me that the alternative count arising by common law of supply simpliciter was no longer available by reason of the provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, that argument was only faintly put in the latter stages of the submissions by Mr Simpson for Mr Roberts, and was refuted by Mr O'Sullivan for Ms Schumacher. In my view it could not be inferred from the provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which lay down statutory alternatives for some offences under the Act that the Legislature had thereby determined that no common law alternative open from the indictment would be available other than those prescribed by the legislation. 
     
      
    11 It must be borne in mind, as King and other cases point out, that the alternative verdict is normally seen as being in an accused person's favour, such that a failure to put it before the jury would result in a miscarriage of justice. Thus there would need to be a very strong inference indeed arising form the provisions of the Act that Parliament intended to repeal a common law procedure, which was in favour of an accused person, before the submission of Mr Simpson could be accepted. In my view such an inference could not possibly be drawn from a consideration of the provisions of the Act and from the simple fact that it has provided some statutory alternatives which apply in respect of some offences. 
     
      
    12 In my view the common law continues to apply and in this case the alternative of supply simpliciter arises from the terms of the first count in the indictment and is, therefore, I believe at least open for consideration for the jury. 
     
      
    13 I accept that in some cases the alternative should not be left because to do so would be to trivialise the matter before the jury or for some other reason might be unfair. If in this case the evidence of Mr Roberts was simply that he had supplied drugs on one occasion to, for example, Ms Schumacher or to some other person then it would not be appropriate to leave the alternative count to the jury. However, the evidence here is that between March 2001 and September 2001 Mr Roberts and Ms Schumacher were involved in a frequent, if not continuous, involvement with amphetamine during the course of which that drug was supplied to other persons either by Ms Schumacher with Mr Roberts’s knowledge and consent, or by Mr Roberts to Ms Schumacher and for her to supply it to other persons such as her sister. 
     
      
    14 In those circumstances it seems to me that, if this alternative were not left to the jury, the consequence would be on the one hand that the accused would run the risk of a conviction of the more serious offence simply because the evidence of supply within the period charged is overwhelming and the jury may be unwilling to acquit them outright. On the other hand, if the accused were acquitted of the charge in the first count in the indictment then they would be open to plead autrefois acquit or some other procedural bar in relation to a charge of supply amphetamine between March 2001 and September 2001. That would not be an appropriate result in the interests of justice generally. 
     
      
    15 In those circumstances it seems to me that the evidence is clear that the alternative count is supported by material, at least by the evidence of Mr Roberts and the telephone conversations that have been placed before the jury. Although I appreciate the argument put forward on behalf of Mr Roberts, that the case he came to meet was that charged in the indictment, there is no possible procedural or other prejudice to the accused by having the alternative count left to the jury when it so clearly arises from the evidence before them. This is not the same situation as arose in Cameron, where the alternative was raised by the trial judge in answer to an application for a verdict by direction at the end of the Crown case. In the present circumstances it seems to me that the alternative count should be left to the jury. Whether an alternative should be left in other cases, where the parties do not seek it, is a matter to be addressed upon the particular facts and circumstances arising in the case.  
     
      
    16 There is a concession by the Crown that the common law alternative only arises if the jury is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the Crown case based upon the evidence of Ms Love and Mr Chapman and are prepared to act upon the basis that the evidence of Mr Roberts might possibly be true. If that be the case, then it seems to me that the jury could not find the accused guilty of the statutory alternative of supplying an amount of amphetamine being not less than the commercial quantity. Such a verdict falls between two stools. On the one hand the Crown contends that the accused were engaged in the supply of drugs well over the large commercial quantity and, on the other, the accused's case, explicitly or by implication, is that they were involved in the supply of drugs in the course of their own drug usage. The Crown has conceded that there is no viable factual basis for the jury to consider the statutory alternative and the only charges that will be left to the jury will be supply of a large commercial quantity or supply simpliciter.

    Ex tempore - revisedTHE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONADAMS JLISMORE: MONDAY 19 APRIL 200470019/03 - REGINA v DENNIS JAMES DALTONNON PUBLICATION ORDER AS TO NAMES OF VICTIM AND VICTIM'S MOTHERSENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender pleaded guilty before me on 8 April 2004 to the offence of manslaughter arising out of the death of a young child on 18 January 2002. It is agreed that the basis of that plea is that the offender caused the child’s death by an unlawful and dangerous act. This plea comes on the verge of the commencement of the offender's trial. Although it has some utilitarian value, this is not great. Aside from avoiding the expense and inconvenience of a trial, its main virtue is that it avoids the necessity of the child's mother giving evidence, which must have been very distressing for her. In accordance with the law as laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal it seems to me that an appropriate discount from the sentence I would otherwise have imposed is of the order of ten percent.  
     
      
    2 The facts have been agreed and may be briefly stated. The offender was born on 2 December 1983 and was accordingly just over eighteen years of age at the time of the offence. He is now something over twenty years old. In January 2002, the offender and the child’s mother, were living together in a de facto relationship in Casino with the mother’s two children, a baby, born 26 November 2001 and the child born 23 January 2000. The mother was about a year younger than the offender. The child’s natural father, was then serving a prison sentence in Queensland. The offender and the mother had known each other prior to this, when the mother was living with the child and his natural father in Bundaberg. Shortly after the natural father’s incarceration, the offender, the mother and the child moved to Casino. It was mid year and the mother was then three months pregnant with the second child. At first they lived with some of the offender's relations, and about two months later moved into a flat of their own. 
     
      
    3 The mother said that she had noticed that the offender smacked the child’s legs for no reason when they were living with his cousin. As is obvious, he was then seventeen years of age. When the offender was told not to do it, even by his mother or sisters, he threatened to assault them. However, on one occasion when he and the mother argued about his treatment of the child, he said he was sorry and would not do it again. Unfortunately, after they moved into their own flat, the offender became more violent towards the child and the mother saw him backhand the child to the side of his face within a few days of their moving. She said that, one way or another, the offender was violent towards the child every day. He threatened that if she told DOCS about what was happening, they would take the child away from her and she was scared that this might happen. They would often argue. The situation became worse and despite her pregnant condition, the offender started to push the mother when she went to pick the child up, though mainly he just threatened her. 
     
      
    4 The offender's violence towards the child in the end resulted in the child's admission to Casino Hospital at just after 3.30pm on 17 January 2002. He was unconscious. The offender and the mother had first told medical staff that the child had fallen off a couch and hit his head, however, the admitting doctor concluded that the child had been ""violently assaulted and was probably going to die from his brain stem injury"". The child was transferred to Lismore Base Hospital where he was assessed by Doctor Chris Gavaghan, the Director of Accident and Emergency. Dr Gavaghan noted bruising on the right side of the child's face in the form of three circular bruises in a row between the right eye and the mouth, which were black in colour and measured under two centimetres each. There was evidence of retinal haemorrhages in both eyes and haemorrhages behind the left and right tympanic membranes of the ears, symptomatic of accelerative brain injury. Dr Gavaghan also noted a number of other small older bruises over the chest wall. An urgent brain scan showed that the child had significant bleeding in his brain. A skeletal survey revealed multiple arm fractures of different ages in the left arm and an old healed fracture in the right arm. One of the fractures in the left arm was a clearly visible fracture of the left wrist. Dr Gavaghan was of the opinion that ""the child was most likely subjected to continuous abuse over a prolonged period of time and this is evidenced in his skeletal survey and his general nutritional state"". This last observation rather demonstrates the couple’s inadequate parenting skills, rather than any deliberate abuse.  
     
      
    5 The child was placed on life support in the Intensive Care Unit. About 10.50am on Friday 18 January 2002, the child was examined by two Intensive Care specialists and life was pronounced extinct. He was just five days short of his second birthday when he died. 
     
      
    6 A post mortem examination conducted by Dr Peter Bradhurst at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Glebe, disclosed multiple bruises over the child's body, especially the face, chest, right forearm and right thigh. Dr Bradhurst also found head injuries, spinal injuries and fractures of different ages. He concluded that the injuries were indicative of non-accidental injury and stated that the cause of death was head and possibly spinal injuries. 
     
      
    7 The offender and the mother were both interviewed by police on 17 January 2002 but lied about what had happened to the child. About three weeks later, the mother was again interviewed by police. On this occasion she informed them that the offender had been in the room with the child and that she had heard the child crying. She said that she went into the room and told the offender to leave the child alone. The accused pushed her out of the way and pushed the child's head against the window, and said, ""Shut up, [child’s name]."" 
     
      
    8 On 1 March 2002, the offender was further interviewed by police. He agreed that he had placed the child on the window sill but denied pushing his head against the window. However, he admitted that he had been present when the child lost consciousness. During this interview, the offender also admitted tying up the child and making him stand in the corner. 
     
      
    9 Dr Kieran Moran, the Director of the Child Protection Unit, Sydney Children's Hospital, was consulted by police and reported –  
     
      
       
        
        ""The child died as a result of abusive head trauma and that he had been severely abused prior to the fatal incident. It is likely that he suffered a variety of severe impacts to the head during the fatal assault."" 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Dr Moran considered that the child would have lost consciousness as soon as the primary diffuse brain injury occurred. He also thought that none of the initial versions supplied by the offender explained the severity of the primary brain injury. In his evidence in the committal proceedings on 14 February 2003, Dr Moran testified that the fatal injury could have occurred as a result of an extremely severe acceleration against a soft surface such as a mattress, which included a whip-lashing movement to the head. He agreed that a male taking hold of a child and throwing it with great force and power onto a mattress on the floor could have caused the fatal injury. 
       
      
    10 Eventually, on 22 July 2003, the mother told police in detail of the events immediately leading up to the ultimately fatal injury to the child. The mother stated that she was in the laundry and heard the child screaming so she ran into his bedroom –  
     
      
       
        
        ""I ran in there and saw DJ [the offender] had him up on the window sill holding him by the shoulders. DJ wanted him to jump and he would let go of him. DJ said, 'I want him to jump.' I said, 'Can't you see he's scared, he's shaking.' [The child] started screaming louder and DJ grabbed his head and just pushed it into the window, just the once, he pushed him backwards into the window. I went over to grab [the child] but DJ pushed me away. When he pushed [the child’s] head into the window he used two hands, he grabbed him over the ears and just thrust his head back against the window, it was just too quick. It was loud but the window didn't smash or crack. He then took him off and chucked him on the mattress. It was a forceful chuck. He chucked him on his back and his head was on the edge.""  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The child lost consciousness immediately after that. 
       
      
    11 On 10 September 2002, the offender was arrested and charged with the child’s death. He has been in custody since that date. 
     
      
    12 During the investigation a number of persons were interviewed and supplied statements to police. Many of these persons witnessed the offender abusing the child on a number of occasions during the previous six months, making the child stand in a corner for lengthy periods of time, smacking him excessively, dragging the child by the arm, lifting him by one arm and smacking him, hitting him on the head with an open hand, on some occasions causing him to fall heavily on the ground and force feeding the child by taking hold of his mouth and forcing him to chew. 
     
      
    13 It is important to appreciate that the offender is not charged with any of these acts. The sentence that I impose today is for the crime of manslaughter arising from the assaults that caused the head injuries from which the child died on 18 January 2003. The relevance of these other facts is that they demonstrate that the violence of the day in question was not isolated, it was not accidental and it was not momentary. It was the culmination, as it happened, of continual physical abuse. 
     
      
    14 The offender himself has not given an account of what happened but it is clear that he does not dispute that the mother has told the truth. In evidence before me, he has expressed his sorrow for what happened but I very much doubt that this is deeply felt. However, my impression may simply reflect the offender’s difficulty with expressing emotion, other than anger. He described himself to Dr Lloyd, a psychologist whose report has been tendered on his behalf in these proceedings, as having ""a short fuse"". He is easily aroused to anger and has constant feelings of emotional devastation, resulting largely from an upbringing marked in early life by extreme physical and emotional abuse. Of course, he is not responsible for these feelings, but – for all his undoubted immaturity – he is responsible for the acts which result from them. He began to use marijuana and alcohol in his early teens but became involved in playing with the Casino RSL Rugby Club, took up BMX bike riding and stunt riding. In his mid teens, his life became increasingly dominated by marijuana and alcohol. It is clear from the relationship with the mother and the child that the cycle of violence and abuse that typified the offender's early childhood has returned with the roles reversed. As so often happens, the victim becomes the perpetrator in a repeated cycle of violence. 
     
      
    15 It is important in the context of this case to give weight to the fact that the offender is Aboriginal and hence part of a marginalised community which, in his case, I think has contributed significantly to his own feelings of inadequacy and self hatred, to which Dr Lloyd has referred: see R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. 
     
      
    16 Dr Lloyd has diagnosed the presence of Borderline Personality Disorder, which is regrettably likely to be exacerbated in prison. The offender has been self-harming – in part, I think due to feelings of guilt which he has, until now attempted to deny – and needs supervision. Without lengthy and intense treatment for some years, the offender is unlikely to improve, even outside the prison context. Moreover, the prospects of success even with such treatment are doubtful. 
     
      
    17 The relative youth of the offender is a most significant factor in the assessment of an appropriate sentence, and points to the great importance of rehabilitation in this particular case: though not a child at the time of the offence, he was very far from a mature adult. Objectively, the offence was a very serious one, but I am quite satisfied that the offender did not realise the serious potential for grave injury that his actions caused, though he was well aware that his actions were criminal assaults, quite capable of causing painful injuries, to which he was apparently angrily indifferent. I think that he still feels that the child’s death at his hands was accidental; this might merely be a mark of the offender's relative immaturity. 
     
      
    18 I have reluctantly concluded that the circumstances of the offender's crime are so serious that I am bound to impose a term of imprisonment which will result in the offender serving some more time in prison. Though unexpected, a small child was killed by the offender's act of deliberate cruelty, an act which he knew to be wrong and of a kind which he had been told on many occasions he should not commit. 
     
      
    19 The criminal law has only crude tools at its command, but its fundamental role is to protect society from violence, especially potentially lethal violence. This requires weight to be given both to the personal deterrence of the offender, which is of particular relevance in this case having regard to the psychological report, and to general deterrence of those who think that violence to children will not be treated seriously. At the same time, the relative youth of the offender requires, and his psychological dysfunction must qualify, the application of the element of general deterrence and requires some amelioration of the sentence that would otherwise have been appropriate for a mature adult and a structure that will encourage rehabilitation.  
     
      
    20 As I have already mentioned, the offender has been in custody since 10 September 2002. He has spent most of that time in special protection and will continue to do so. Moreover, the conditions of imprisonment whilst on remand are significantly more harsh than ordinary imprisonment, so that merely to backdate the sentence is an inadequate adjustment. This is an important factor which requires an allowance to be made in the term still to be served. There are, as is obvious, special circumstances that justify a departure from the statutory calculus in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, primarily to enable a lengthy period of supervision and support after the offender's release. I have taken into account the offender's expression of contrition in addition to the utilitarian discount. 
     
      
    21 Dennis Dalton, you are sentenced to serve a minimum term of imprisonment of three years and three months from 10 September 2002, so that you will be eligible to be released on parole on 9 December 2005. The balance of the term of seven years’ imprisonment will expire on 9 September 2009. I direct that on your release to parole you shall place yourself under the supervision and control of the Adult Probation Service for the period of parole, or such earlier time as that Service considers desirable.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONADAMS JLISMORE: MONDAY 19 APRIL 200470114/03 - REGINA v BERYL ANNE MERCYSENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: I should say by way of introduction, that although I have once referred to the name of the deceased, I am aware that Aboriginal people have a sensitivity to mentioning the name of a deceased person and accordingly I do not otherwise refer to his name. 
     
      
    2 The offender, Beryl Anne Mercy, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Berrin Dean Charles on 12 February 2003, with whom she was then living in a de facto relationship. The deceased died from a wound inflicted by the offender with a kitchen knife to the left back of his chest. 
     
      
    3 The circumstances of the wounding, though not completely clear, are not controversial. The offender and the deceased, who are both Aboriginal, had known each other for almost twenty years, having had a brief relationship when the offender was nineteen years of age. She will be forty years old in six months time. As a result of that relationship, the offender and the deceased had a daughter Neesha. Thereafter they continued with a platonic and casual friendship over the ensuing years until about nine months or so before the deceased was killed, when they commenced living together in a de facto relationship. The offender had left a longstanding relationship of some fifteen years with a Mr Paul Johnston, to whom she had four children, to live with the deceased. Despite this Mr Johnston, who had continued to look after the children, has said that he would be prepared to resume a family relationship with the offender when she is free. It is important to note that although the offender left her children in Mr Johnston's care whilst living with the deceased, she visited them frequently and often stayed with them for two or three days at a time. I do not doubt that she very much cares for them, and that her separation from them is painful for her. 
     
      
    4 It is clear that the offender has had a serious drinking problem for many years and that it became very much worse when she resumed living with the deceased. She said to Ms Danielle Castles, the Manager of the Client Assessment and Referral for the Legal Aid Commission, who prepared a psycho-social report for the purpose of these proceedings, that she started to drink daily, and was ""blacking out all the time with Benny, all the time in the day and all.""  
     
      
    5 Part of the difficulty with determining the events immediately preceding the fatal wounding is that both parties were drunk at the time. The deceased had a blood alcohol reading of well over .232 grams per 100 millilitres of blood, and the offender was also significantly affected by alcohol, although not to the same extent. 
     
      
    6 The relationship between the offender and the deceased was not only characterised by excessive drinking, but after some months, by physical abuse. The detail of this abuse comes from primarily from what the offender told Ms Castles, but she confirmed it under oath in this Court, and she was not cross-examined to suggest that she had not told the truth. Mr Bruce of counsel for the offender did not take her through the details. I draw no adverse inference from this. To require any woman to give detailed evidence of material of this character in an open court room must cause considerable embarrassment and distress. To do so to this particular witness, even more so, especially when the deceased's close relatives are in the public gallery. I do not intend by this observation to imply any criticism at all. Of course, the family and friends of the deceased will in the ordinary course of things wish to be present at proceedings of this kind. At the same time, their presence may well place constraints on the way in which evidence is adduced, especially where that evidence is emotionally laden and implies some criticism of the deceased. 
     
      
    7 The temptation, indeed the need, to justify or at least explain the criminal use of lethal violence in a case like the present, is a strong one, and it is necessary to approach with some scepticism unsupported allegations of violence on the part of the deceased made by an offender. I should say, however, that I thought the offender was candid and truthful in her evidence, and in some respects, her accounts of the deceased's jealous anger and violent behaviour is supported by independent witnesses. 
     
      
    8 I do not intent in these reasons to set out in detail the offender's account of the deceased's abusive behaviour toward her. It involved not only frequent violence and threats of violence but also verbal abuse. She was asked by Ms Castles if she tried to leave the relationship and she replied: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A lot of times. When he wasn't around me I got that way (I thought) he was spying on me. I was so scared. He said 'Don't you ever talk to anyone, I'll find out, I'm watching you.' He said if I left him he would hang himself on a tree with my name on him. I thought to myself 'no way, I can't let him do that.' I always blame myself. Today I still blame myself. I would wake up with a black eye or busted mouth. I would say 'I am going to do everything he says', so I wouldn't get hit. Then at night he would make accusations and it would start."" 
        
       
       
      Mr Johnston has confirmed one occasion when the offender was hit by the deceased when she attempted to leave him, and fled to his house. 
       
      
    9 During the two weeks allegedly prior to 12 February 2003, the offender and the deceased were living with a mutual friend, Tracey Grant, and her three young children. Ms Grant described the couple's relationship to police in her statement as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Berrin drinks alcohol every day, he is a heavy drinker. Alcohol makes Berrin jealous about Beryl. I would describe Berrin as a violent person. I have not seen Berrin assault Beryl. I remember an occasion last week when Berrin came to my place, he was banging on the door and I noticed that his fingers were cut. Berrin said 'Look what I have done to Beryl' and he showed me his fingers. Beryl came running down to my place from the Mission. Beryl said 'Look at what he has done to me.' I took this to mean that Berrin had hit her. I had a look at Beryl and noticed her two lower front teeth were knocked into her mouth. Beryl's mouth was bleeding. I reported this matter to the Police and the Police attended my house. Beryl spoke to the Police at my house. Beryl later had to go to the dentist and have two teeth taken out. Berrin gets verbally abusive towards Beryl when he is drunk, he sort of plays mind games with her and he talks under his breath to Beryl. He would pull her aside and have conversations with her away from everyone else. Berrin did not like to let Beryl out of his sight."" 
        
       
      
    10 Ms Grant said that on 11 February 2003, the offender had been drinking for most of the day and into the night, with friends and family. He was also smoking cannabis. The offender came in the afternoon and was drinking as well. Ms Grant was so affected by alcohol, however, that she was unaware that the deceased had been stabbed. The persons who were in the house at the time and who made statements to the police were also considerably affected by alcohol. A Mr Close mentions an argument between the offender and the deceased that appears to have been instigated by the offender. He said both of them were drunk. He went into the back yard with a flagon to get away from them. He was told of the stabbing afterwards by one of the other witnesses.  
     
      
    11 Mr Mitchell Hoskings was also present that day but left in the late afternoon. He told police that he had seen the deceased assault the offender on a number of occasions. He said that when he was leaving, the two were arguing over the children, but declined to tell police what was said. He thought that at that time they were still sober. 
     
      
    12 Mr Edward Hoskings knew the offender and the deceased for many years. He said that they often argued. He had been in the group that day but went to bed about 7 o'clock. He woke to voices yelling in panic and was told that the offender had stabbed the deceased. It seems that he did not recall any argument that afternoon or evening. 
     
      
    13 The offender's daughter Neesha, had gone that day to the house with her mother to see the deceased, her father. They arrived, she told police, about midday. Her father was, as she described it, ""already charged up when we got there."" She and her mother were drinking beer. As Neesha recalled the events, the offender told her she was going to bed and went into the bedroom she shared with the deceased where the deceased then was. Neesha heard them arguing. Her mother came out to the kitchen where Neesha was and accused the deceased of sleeping with another woman, as Neesha recalls what she said. The offender grabbed something off the top of the sink and went back to the bedroom. Shortly after, Neesha heard her father yelling, ""I think in pain"". She walked to the bedroom and saw him lying on the floor at the end of the bed. He was on his side and she saw blood on his back. The offender was standing next to him not saying anything. Ms Grant came in and picked up a knife from the floor. An ambulance was called almost immediately and attended about 10 minutes later. The records show that the call was made just after 12.30am on 12 February. The deceased's condition was obviously serious, and he deteriorated whilst being taken to hospital. He died about two and a half hours later. 
     
      
    14 In the result, it appeared the deceased died from blood loss, mainly from a lacerated spleen. I should mention that it is clear from a neighbour's statement that the offender and the deceased were having quite a loud and heated argument for some time before the final confrontation.  
     
      
    15 It is necessary to consider the statements of the witnesses with considerable care, having regard to their relationship with both the deceased and the offender, and the fact that they were Aboriginal and were speaking to police officers. 
     
      
    16 The offender was interviewed by police at about 3.40am on 12 February. Her account is essentially that she and the deceased were having a pleasant evening when he started to abuse her calling her names, which I do not think it necessary to quote, and making accusations of sexual misbehaviour. When they went to the bedroom this continued and the offender punched his face. Although as I have mentioned, her account is not altogether clear, it seems that the deceased grabbed the offender's singlet and at the same time attempted to close the door. The offender said that he did this when he intended to assault her. She said that she managed to escape after several attempts. She went to the kitchen and saw the knife. She said, ""And I thought, “Well I'll just teach him’."" The offender grabbed the knife and returned to the bedroom intending, she says, to scare the deceased and to ""show him that I wasn't afraid of him because he was always bashing me around"". The offender described what happened in this way, after having said that she had the knife in her right hand and was walking down the passageway to the bedroom: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And when you were walking down there, what were you intending to do? A. Nothing, absolutely nothing. 
         
        Q. When you entered the bedroom Berrin was laying on his side? A. Yeah 
         
        Q. Still laying on the ground? A. Yes. 
         
        Q. All right, can you tell me what you did then? A. He was laying there looking at me and he just said 'What are you doing?' and I said 'Why are you jealous of me Benny?' 
         
        Q. Sorry? A. He said 'What are you doing?' 
         
        Q. Yes? A. I said 'Benny why are you jealous of me?' He didn't say nothing. I said 'I'm sick of you hitting me all the time' and he just said, 'You deserve it' so I got the knife and put it up and I tapped him with the knife, just tapped him and I felt it go in. 
         
        Q. Where did you think you'd get him? A. In the back I knew. 
         
        Q. Okay in the back, whereabouts in the back? A. Um, on his left side, I think just below his shoulder blade. 
         
        Q. So did he have his back turned to you when you stabbed him? A. No, he was lookin’ at me. 
         
        Q. Yes, so he's still laying on his side? 
         
        A. Yeah, and I said 'I'll stab you', he just looked at me and said 'Do it, do it.' I wasn't going to do it. 
         
        Q. Okay so when you hit him with the knife, what were you intending to do? A. I only wanted to frighten him. I didn't think the knife would go in because it had no point on it. I didn't think it would go in. 
         
        Q. But did you want to hurt him with the knife? A. No, no because it had no point, it was just round, I thought it was blunt and I didn't think the knife would go in him.  
         
        Q. How hard did you hit him with the knife? 
         
        A. It wasn't hard, I just, just went in like that. 
         
        Q. OK. So after the knife went in did you pull it back out? A. Yes. 
         
        Q. And it's then you noticed is it that it went in? A. Yeah."" 
        
       
      
    17 I have inspected the knife. It indeed has a rounded end which is a millimetre or so wide. I accept that the offender was surprised when it wounded the deceased so easily. I think, however, that she used rather more force than a tapping. Despite its blunt tip, the knife penetrated the skin to a depth of at least 115 millimetres. Even so, I believe that the offender did not intend to inflict any serious injury on the deceased, that indeed she wanted only to frighten him and that she only struck him when he taunted her. I should add that although the offender was angry and hurt, I do not believe that she was acting under the impression that the deceased had been unfaithful or by way of any response to any such suggestion. 
     
      
    18 As I have mentioned, the offender gave evidence before me. That account also was unclear. This may be explained by a number of factors, including the extent of her intoxication and emotional turmoil at the time of the events and the shocking consequences of what she did. However, I also think that the offender has not yet acknowledged to herself what actually happened. She said that when she returned to the bedroom with the knife, the deceased was ""laying there swearing at me"". She told him that she .""was sick of you hitting me all the time."" The deceased said, ""Do it if you're gunna do it, just do it"". The offender said he was looking straight at her, smiling. She became angry, and in her words, ""tapped him"". She was unable to remember whether she was standing or kneeling at the time but she thought she was kneeling. The offender was asked what she felt about what happened. She said, ""Well if I could turn back the time I would, I wouldn't have grabbed the knife at all, I've not only ruined my life, I've ruined his family and my children. I haven't got a life"". 
     
      
    19 It seems to me that when the offender got the knife, her intention was, indeed, merely to frighten the deceased. She was upset and angry and drunk. When she showed the knife to him as a threat, he simply taunted her. This, of course, simply emphasised her helplessness. She had, without thinking it through, reached the point of no return. Rather than back down and make her threat a meaningless and humiliating gesture, she struck at him in defiance with lethal consequences. It should be recalled that she had earlier punched the deceased in the face and that on her own account, he had not assaulted her, although it may well be that her apprehension, that as she put it, she ""was in for a flogging"", was an accurate one.  
     
      
    20 Accordingly, this is not a case of self defence, although it did have an element, as Mr Bruce contended, of the offender taking a stand. But she went too far and in so doing, committed manslaughter. 
     
      
    21 In the result, I am satisfied that the deceased had been continuously abusive towards the offender, both verbally and physically including sexual abuse, that on the night in question he implicitly threatened violence, that she got the knife to frighten him and struck him in response to his taunts to demonstrate that she was not afraid of him, and I also am satisfied that she did not think that the knife would cause any serious injury. As I have mentioned, she was affected by alcohol at the time and was not thinking clearly. 
     
      
    22 The objective seriousness of the offender's crime must be regarded as considerable. The unlawful taking of human life has always been regarded as a grave crime. It is obvious from what I have said already that there were present in this case some significant extenuating circumstances, but to use a knife to cause a lethal injury even in those circumstances, is a grave offence. Even accepting everything that the offender has said about what happened, the fact is that she had managed to evade the deceased, there were other people in the house including her own daughter. She did not need to return to the bedroom and certainly did not need to do so with a knife. On the offender's own account, she returned to the bedroom to continue her confrontation with the deceased, even at the time at which she struck him with the knife, he was not then threatening violence, at least immediately. 
     
      
    23 I have been referred to a number of cases in which offenders convicted of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act have been dealt with otherwise than by full time imprisonment. It is not necessary for me to analyse them for present purposes. It is enough to say that the circumstances of those cases were very different from the present. In all of them, the violence suffered by the offender had continued for many years; the threats of violence were of far greater seriousness; some involved fear of death at the hands of the deceased; and in a number of cases, children were also under threat. I have therefore come to the view that I am bound to impose a sentence of full time imprisonment. 
     
      
    24 A Victim Impact Statement was read to the Court by Ms Shirley Charles, the sister of the deceased, on her own behalf and that of her family. In it she states how much he meant to them, especially since of her four brothers, the deceased was the last survivor. Ms Charles describes the family's great grief and anger at their loss and their sense that their brother's spirit is not at rest. This proceeding itself will have been the cause of additional pain, as things have been said about their brother which they may well not have known and may find it hard to believe. Ms Charles said in her statement that the deceased did not deserve to die. That is certainly true and that is why the criminal law will punish the offender, but it does so through the Court as the delegate of the community after attempting by an objective and fair process to determine the relevant facts. I do not doubt that the deceased had many good qualities, some of which Ms Charles mentioned in her statement, but above all he was a human being and a member of our community who should still be living his life. 
     
      
    25 It is important to understand that by permitting victim impact statements to be received in a hearing such as this, the law does not thereby place them to be weighed by the Court in the scales of justice. The taking of a life is the gravest injury known to the criminal law. Accordingly, it is not made more serious because the victim's death is the cause of pain or grief to others, however intensely felt. The life of one person cannot be regarded as more valuable than the life of another, or the killing of one person as more grievous than the killing of another, because of their personal or social circumstances. To do this would undermine the moral standards essential to the maintenance of the rule of law. It would be wrong to take one day from an otherwise appropriate sentence for murder because the deceased was selfish, obnoxious, cowardly and without friends or family to grieve for him or her. By exact parity of reasoning, it cannot be right to add a day to an otherwise appropriate sentence because the deceased was honourable, loved and surrounded by friends and family. If this were not so, counsel for the killer might rationally submit that as the victim was of the former character, the crime was less grave, and the sentence should be more lenient, and the Crown Prosecutor, by pointing to a grieving family, submit to the contrary. The virtues or vices of the deceased, the extent of his or her social connections and whether the death caused grief or passed unnoticed by an indifferent public would then become the subject of evidence and argument. The law will neither value a life nor punish a death by such a demeaning process. 
     
      
    26 More difficult perhaps to accept but also crucial to the administration of justice is the notion that the value that the law ascribes to the life which has been taken arises from and reflects that same sense of reason and humanity which requires value also to be ascribed to the lives of the persons who come before the law for punishment. They are the values and aspirations of our society, not the values and aspirations of the criminal. Thus the considerations that moderate the measure of punishment are not applied primarily because of anything due to the offender, but what is due to ourselves as a civilised and humane community, not so much because we respect the criminal, but because we respect ourselves. 
     
      
    27 The High Court has said in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ (at 476) –  
     
      
       
        
        “…sentencing is not a purely logical exercise and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. There are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions….”  
        
       
      
    28 In dealing with offenders, the Court must remain objective and dispassionate. All the relevant facts must be carefully weighed. The circumstances of the crime include not only the result but also the events which gave rise to it, the intentions of the offender, his or her personal characteristics and attributes, and the various explanations for the crime. The public interest as well as the personal interests of the victims and the offender must be reflected in the outcome. As is obvious, these considerations will be in tension if not in conflict. 
     
      
    29 In this case, in particular, the public interest in saving the considerable expense and uncertainty of a trial, and stress and inconvenience to witnesses, requires the Court to give a significant downward adjustment to the offender's ultimate sentence. Even so, as the legislation provides, such a sentence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature in circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    30 It is necessary briefly to describe the offender's subjective circumstances. She is an Aboriginal woman who was born in Coffs Harbour. Her early childhood was a difficult one. She was raised in a home where drunken violence by the males, including sexual abuse, was commonplace. When she was twelve, the offender went to live with her maternal aunt where conditions were much better and at least she felt safe and cared for. The offender had her first child at the age of fifteen, and over the years has had eight children, the youngest four of whom are aged six, eight, ten and eleven years. She left school halfway through year eight during her first pregnancy. She has not had any paid employment. The offender started drinking in her early teens and has been binge drinking now for many years, reaching a climax when she recommenced her relationship with the deceased. The offender is diabetic and in February this year, underwent successful coronary artery by-pass surgery, from which she is still recovering. She has no criminal record. 
     
      
    31 I have no doubt that the offender is genuinely contrite for having killed the deceased. She will not offend again and poses no risk to the community. The Crown Prosecutor has conceded that she pleaded guilty at the first practicable opportunity. Accordingly, I propose to allow a discount of twenty-five percent in the sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. 
     
      
    32 The offender has also spent fifty-seven days in prison whilst on remand. I have taken this into account by reducing both the non parole and balance of her term by three months to allow for the harsher conditions of remand imprisonment. 
     
      
    33 Because the offender's medical condition requires supervision, she will be likely to spend much of her imprisonment in Sydney where it will be difficult if not impossible for her children to visit her and then only rarely. This is an additional hardship which will be accounted for by reducing the otherwise appropriate sentence. I also think that some allowance should be made having regard to the onerous conditions of bail that involved her practical isolation from her family whilst on remand. 
     
      
    34 The offender's medical condition and its consequences, together with the fact that this is her first experience of lengthy imprisonment, constitutes special circumstances justifying departure from the statutory calculus in s44 of the Sentencing Act 1995. 
     
      
    35 Beryl Anne Mercy, for the manslaughter of Berrin Dean Charles you are sentenced to a minimum term of two years and three months imprisonment, to commence on 19 April 2004 and ending on 18 July 2006 on which date you will be eligible for parole. The balance of the sentence is two years and eight months, which will expire on 18 March 2009.

       Sydney Markets Limited (Defendant); 
        
        
       Bill Patton’s Pty Limited (Cross defendant) 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 Shaw J: On 9 December 2003 I published a judgment in this matter in which it was held that damages were payable in respect of injuries occasioned to the plaintiff as a result of three incidents while the plaintiff was driving a forklift truck at the markets at Flemington operated by the first defendant: Jenkins v Sydney Markets Limited  [2003] NSWSC 1162. 
     
      
    2 As a result of that judgment I determined liability in favour of the plaintiff as against the first defendant, entered verdict for the plaintiff, and made an order for costs. The matter was then adjourned to allocate a hearing date on the question of damages. That matter came before the court on 3 March 2004 and, after hearing argument on the question of quantum of damages, I made findings in the following terms (slightly edited for the purpose of this judgment): 
     
      
       
      (a) on 9 December 2003 I delivered judgment in this case in which I held that the plaintiff was partially disabled as a result of a number of incidents which occurred at the markets at Flemington in Sydney. The plaintiff was employed by Bill Patton’s Pty Limited (cross defendant). However the claim in relation to the cross defendant has been settled, although the court has not been informed of the terms of that settlement. The question was whether Sydney Markets Limited owed a duty of care to the plaintiff to prevent the injuries suffered and whether this duty has been breached causing the injuries. 
       
       
      (b) I held that the plaintiff had established, on the balance of probabilities, a causal link between the working environment supervised by, and under the control of, the first defendant and the injuries and incapacity which he has suffered by reason of his slipping on vegetable matter on the floors of the markets and driving a forklift truck over potholes on the asphalt area of the markets.  
       
      
    3 It will be relevant to the ultimate disposition of this matter to consider s 151Z(2) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) which is concerned with the calculation of damages where an injured worker is entitled to take common law proceedings against both the employer and a non-employer. However, it appears clear that an occupier’s duty of care is not abrogated by the independent, non-delegable employer’s duty to the employee: Lapcevic v Collier  [2002] NSWCA 300; TNT Australia Pty Limited v Christie [2003] NSWCA 47.  
     
      
    4 The three incidents relied upon by the plaintiff are specified in my earlier judgment of 9 December 2003: 10 June 1998, March – May 1999 and on or about 17 February 1999. I refer to and adopt my earlier remarks in that respect. 
     
      
    5 The first issue which arises is the extent of the employer’s liability as distinct from the liability of the occupier. As I have indicated, the settlement between the defendants has not been disclosed to the court. However, I adhere to my earlier observation to the effect that it is the employer that has a high, non-delegable, duty of care over its employees, and further, a duty to direct and control the day to day activities of the employees including training and supervision: see for example Kondis v State Transport (1984) 154 CLR 672. 
     
      
    6 Thus, it seems to me that both the employer and the occupier did have a substantial obligation to protect the occupational health and safety of the employees driving forklift trucks in the busy environment of Sydney Markets at Flemington. Accordingly, and for further reasons, which I may give, I would assess the employer’s liability in the respect of the injuries which occurred to the plaintiff as 50%. This assessment differs from the submission put by the first defendant to the effect that the employer should bear the greater responsibility for any acts of negligence, and on the other hand, differs from the submission of the plaintiff that 90% of the responsibility should be visited upon the markets. In my view, it is a fair compromise between 2 entities which both bore a responsibility for creating a safe working environment for employees. I note that the defendant was not pressing a 100% contribution from the employer to any compensation that should be awarded. 
     
      
    7 The next general issue is whether there was any contributory negligence by the plaintiff. It is said by the first defendant that the plaintiff was going about his work in a way which was unsafe and which deprived himself of the right to look ahead, particularly by driving backwards, and by driving (it is alleged, unnecessarily) on the asphalt area of the markets (which contained potholes) whereas the concrete area did not. However, I regard the obligation of both the occupier and the employer as a significant one to provide an appropriate safe working environment for employees and, although there are injuries which are not reasonably foreseeable, nevertheless proof that a danger could possibly occasion some harm is sufficient to impose an obligation on an employer/occupier to take sufficient care with regard to obvious risks: see Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v McGuinness [2002] NSWCA 210. In my opinion, a more thorough cleaning program and the rectification of potholes would have minimised the risk to a forklift driver such as the plaintiff. It is only in relation to the third incident where, it is conceded by counsel for the plaintiff, there is some scope for an argument about contributory negligence. I would propose to deduct from any award of damages in respect of the third accident 30% on the basis of contributory negligence. 
     
      
    8 The first defendant has argued that the videos shown to the court detract from the credibility of the plaintiff as to the extent of his injuries. I am unconvinced that the video material negatives in any fundamental way the assertions made by the plaintiff in the witness box. They do show a certain level of physical ability. However, the effect of injuries such as these disclosed in the current case can be variable on their effects on different days and I generally regard the plaintiff as a reliable and credible witness in his assertions of the adverse effects that he has suffered as a result of this work. On balance, and as I summarised in my earlier judgment, the medical evidence supports the proposition that the plaintiff has suffered some real adverse disabilities. 
     
      
    9 In relation to the first accident, the plaintiff was away from work for 4 weeks, was paid workers compensation and alleges an element of pain and suffering. It seems to me that some relatively modest amount of damages should be paid in respect of that accident. 
     
      
    10 In relation to the second accident I find the requisite level of the worst case scenario has been established and that he should be paid an amount with respect to non-economic loss. As I have earlier indicated, I do not find that there is any contributory negligence in this respect. 
     
      
    11 I have already referred to the third accident where I think there is an element of contributory negligence but I think that the threshold has been reached and that the plaintiff is entitled to a level of compensation for damages. 
     
      
    12 I find it troubling that the plaintiff has not sought, and therefore not obtained, any form of employment following the third accident. It is difficult to accept that he could not work in any capacity, even considering what his counsel has said about psychological overlay as a result of his physical difficulties. It seems to me that there should be some element of reduction of any award of damages as a result of the failure of the plaintiff to mitigate his damages in this respect. 
     
      
    13 As to past economic loss, I would adopt, generally speaking, the submissions of the plaintiff to the effect that he has been certified by a general practitioner and by a psychologist as having an incapacity for work, and that this makes understandable evidence that he has not been seeking work. Seeing the plaintiff in the witness box confirms his general incapacity and I do not believe that the video material satisfactorily negates this incapacity, as I stated earlier, which has been played to the court. I also bear in mind the work history of the plaintiff over about 20 years, which has not been the subject of any criticism and can justly be described in the terms used by counsel for the plaintiff as ”unblemished”. The plaintiff is about 44 years of age, and his working life has been spent at the markets. His cognitive performance is of low average ability, he has low average reading skills and below average mathematical skills. To be more specific a psychologist, Ms Bourne, has given the opinion that:  
     
      
       
        
         
        Unlikely given his current mental state he would be psychologically fit to seek alternative employment. 
        
       
       
      On the other hand, Dr Adler proffered an opinion dated 14 July 2003 that the plaintiff was: 
       
       
        
        fit for customer service work or sedentary employment, however, no transferable skills to sedentary employment such as in respect of clerical/administrative work. 
        
       
       
      The doctor did suggest that there would be a fitness for car park attendant/petrol consol operator up to 5 hours per day; tollgate collector – 4 hours per day. Dr Strum in his report of 11 September 2002 said that the plaintiff had a chronic adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood and accordingly the prognosis was poor. Dr Khan certified him “fit for sedentary or semi-sedentary work.” Dr Anderson thought that:  
       
       
        
        if he can control his pain a bit better it may be possible for him to do a fairly light office work-based occupation. 
        
       
       
      The doctor then suggested he might be a swimming instructor. All in all, and whilst having regard to the diversity of these medical opinions in various respects, I accept the submission of the plaintiff that, having regard to the age, skills and medical condition of the plaintiff, he is unlikely to return to the workforce. However, there is some residual earning capacity. I adopt the submission of the plaintiff that he should be allowed a loss of $250 net per week. 
       
      
    14 After I had made the findings, which I have recounted, counsel raised the need for some further findings. One issue identified was residual retained capacity and I have endeavoured to indicate that I think there is some but to a modest degree. Whilst the plaintiff alleges no retained capacity, I adopt the plaintiff’s alternative submission that any such capacity is small and I have quantified the amount which should be paid having regard to that residual capacity.  
     
      
    15 Then counsel urged upon me that I should specify the general damages and the percentage of the most extreme case that I should allow for each particular incident. 
     
      
    16 Understandably enough, the defendant has not felt able to, itself, put forward a positive figure or percentage in relation to these accidents because it argues, “that the evidence doesn’t support a finding of diminished capacity” (T p 365.33). The extent of the defendant’s submission is therefore that the findings about general damages, having regard to the fact that I have found diminished capacity, should be as low as counsel for the defendant can persuade the court and that Mr Dooley, counsel for the plaintiff would urge the highest possible figures. 17 I make orders in respect of the following heads of damage:(i) The “Pothole case”, being damages for medical and other expenses incurred by the plaintiff for the amount of $22,834.00. 
     
      
    (ii) The “Third accident”, being the incident of 17 February 1999, for past medical and other associated expenses for the amount of $17,497.00.(iii) Income taxation instalments deducted by the plaintiff’s employer in respect of workers’ compensation payments (commonly known as Fox v Wood) - $38,512.00: Fox v Wood (1981) 148 CLR 438.(iv) Damages in respect of the three accidents to be calculated as follows:

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: On 7 May 2003, Judge Urquhart sentenced the applicants and another offender, Nathan Charles, for the offence of aggravated enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence contrary to s 113(3) of the Crimes Act. That is an offence to which a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years has been prescribed. The three offenders had been indicted for an offence of armed robbery with wounding contrary to s 98 of the Act, with the s 113(3) offence as an alternative count. On 5 May 2003 they pleaded not guilty to the first count on the indictment but guilty to the alternative count and the Crown accepted those pleas in full satisfaction of the indictment. The s 113(3) charge alleged that the serious offence they intended to commit was stealing and that the circumstance of aggravation was the wounding of the occupant of the premises, Dr Negus. 
     
      
    3 His Honour sentenced the offender Charles to imprisonment for 7 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 5 years. Those sentences dated from 7 May 2003 and the offender is eligible for release to parole on 7 May 2008. The applicant Newman was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, that sentence commencing on 10 October 2002. He is eligible for release to parole on 10 October 2007. The applicant Simpson was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years 3 months and 21 days, which is an effective sentence of 5½ years, with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 6 May 2003. She is eligible for release to parole on 6 May 2006. 
     
      
    4 Before outlining the facts in this matter something should be said about the way the proceedings were conducted. The Crown tendered to the Court what purported to be an “Agreed Statement of Facts” together with the brief of evidence. The statement of facts tendered would have supported the charge of armed robbery with wounding, an offence for which the applicants were not to be sentenced. All the facts upon which his Honour was asked to sentence the offenders would have sustained the more serious offence, except possibly in the case of Ms Simpson. No objection was taken to the material placed before the sentencing judge and none of the parties apparently considered how his Honour was to sentence the applicants for the offence to which they had pleaded guilty without in effect sentencing them for the more serious offence. 
     
      
    5 In Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174, with the concurrence of Levine and Hidden JJ, I said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It behoves the parties, especially after a “plea bargain”, to ensure that the sentencing court is made aware from the outset of the proceedings whether there is any dispute as to the factual basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced and identify with particularity what matters are in issue. Disputed facts are to be resolved by accusatorial process upon evidence before the court, Chow v DPP(1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 604-608. If a statement of facts is to be tendered, it should both support the charge for which the offender is to be sentenced and accord with the offence charged. It should not contain facts that would aggravate the offence in breach of the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. If it purports to be an agreed statement of facts so that it is intended to provide the factual basis upon which the parties wish the court to sentence the offender, the facts should be sufficient to permit the court to exercise its discretion and the Crown should not tender other material which might supplement or contradict the facts set out in the agreed statement. If other material is placed before the court which relates to the facts of the offence, then the parties should understand that the court is not bound by the tendered statement of facts or any agreement made between the parties as to the basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced: Altham (1992) 62 A Crim R 126; Chow v DPP, above at 606…………………………. 
        
       
      
    6 The present proceedings did not conform to that statement of practice. No complaint was raised about the matter as a ground of appeal nor was it addressed in submissions until raised by the Court. However, inconformity between the offence and the factual basis upon which the sentence is to be based is never a matter of mere technicality. It has real substance in the present case when an assessment has to be made of the seriousness of the particular offence committed by the offenders as against the maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment for the offence to which they pleaded guilty. Where, as here, no distinction is drawn between the offence for which the Court was to sentence the offender and a more serious offence for which they are not to be sentenced, there is a real likelihood of the sentencing discretion miscarrying. 
     
      
    7 The factual basis upon which Judge Urquhart sentenced the applicants can be briefly stated. On 9 October 2002 in Griffith at around midnight the two applicants and the man Charles, Ms Simpson’s then de facto partner, agreed to steal property from the home of Dr Negus for the purpose of obtaining money to purchase alcohol. They were all heavily intoxicated, having been drinking since about 6 pm that evening. 
     
      
    8 Ms Simpson knew Dr Negus personally as on occasions she received counselling and spiritual support from him. He had from time to time assisted her by providing food and nappies for her young children. He was aged 67 years at the date of the offence. It was Ms Simpson who suggested that he would be a suitable victim and she drew a detailed sketch of his premises for her co-offenders. It was also agreed that she would obtain entry to the premises and distract the victim, using the opportunity to leave a door open for the other two. Ms Simpson believed they would enter the premises and steal property belonging to the doctor. 
     
      
    9 Notwithstanding their impecuniosity, the three offenders caught a taxi to the victim’s premises. Ms Simpson rang the doorbell but, when this was unanswered, she went to the sliding door of the victim’s bedroom. She identified herself to the doctor and told him that she wanted to talk to him about becoming a Christian. He unlocked the door and opened it, allowing her to enter. Almost immediately Ms Simpson said she needed to go outside to vomit. When she re-entered the house, the victim took her to the bathroom. They then returned to the bedroom, where he was confronted by the applicant Newman and Charles, both wearing balaclavas. They grabbed the victim and threw him onto the bed. Charles punched him in the face and held a knife under the victim’s nose. The victim pulled off Charles’ balaclava and recognised him as Ms Simpson’s de facto partner. 
     
      
    10 Mr Newman then left the room and Charles attacked the victim by punching and kicking him when he had been dragged from the bed to the floor. He was shouting, “Where is your money? Where is your gold? Where is your safe? Where is your rocks?” The last demand was taken by the victim to be a reference to his deceased wife’s jewellery. Mr Newman returned to the bedroom and both he and Charles threw the mattress over the victim. He was told to remain where he was for ten minutes so that they could get away. The two men then left the premises. It was later ascertained that a DVD player, a video player, a tin containing foreign money and the victim’s motor vehicle had been stolen. 
     
      
    11 Ms Simpson and Charles returned by taxi to their premises. They were later joined by Mr Newman in the victim’s motor vehicle which was later used by him and others for joy-riding. 
     
      
    12 Dr Negus raised the alarm and was conveyed to hospital. He was treated for lacerations to various parts of his head, a fractured cheekbone, fractured ribs and bruised kidney. He also suffered nerve damage to his face as a result of one deep laceration. 
     
      
    13 The applicants and Charles were arrested on 10 October at the premises where they were living and items of property belonging to the victim were recovered. His motor vehicle was located nearby. 
     
      
    14 Ms Simpson participated in an ERISP in which she admitted having planned the offence to get some property to sell. She also admitted drawing a plan of the house for the purpose of breaking into it and obtaining property. She believed that the two men were going to “stand over him” and scare him by their tone of voice but were not to physically assault him. After she gained entry to the premises, she left open the sliding door for the men to gain entry while she went to the bathroom. She later took her shoes off so that she could sneak around the premises looking for property. She said that, as soon as she heard the victim being bashed, she ran out of the house. She later met up with Charles who was carrying a video player. 
     
      
    15 These facts clearly contain all the elements of the offence of armed robbery with wounding at least so far as the applicant Newman and Mr Charles were concerned: yet his Honour could not sentence for that offence, and did not purport to do so. But his Honour was entitled to take into account any aggravating factor present in the commission of the offence, whether or not that particular fact had been alleged in the indictment. See R v Li (NSWCCA, unreported, 9 July 1997). The relevant aggravating factors are contained in s 105A of the Crimes Act. They include that the offender was armed with an offensive weapon, and that corporal violence was used against the victim. These are, of course, two of the elements of the offence of armed robbery. 
     
      
    16 The solution to this conundrum appears to be that, in the case of the applicant Newman, his Honour was not entitled to take into account the fact that any property was stolen as a consequence of the use of force and the production of the knife by Charles. In the case of the applicant Simpson, his Honour could not take into account either that fact or that a knife was used. As the Crown described it before us, s 113 is a kind of inchoate offence in that it only requires that a specific intention to commit a serious indictable offence be proved and it does not matter that the offence intended was not actually completed. But as I have indicated, no complaint was raised on the appeal that his Honour erred by taking into account a fact or facts giving rise to the more serious offence. Even if the Court disregards the fact that any property was stolen or, in Ms Simpson’s case, the use of a knife by Charles, the offence remains a serious one, and in my view is, on an objective view of the facts, towards the upper seriousness of an offence of its kind. 
     
      
    17 There was scant material before the sentencing judge with regard to Ms Simpson’s personal circumstances. She did not give evidence and there were none of the usual psychological or pre-sentence reports tendered. She was aged 22 years at the time of the offence and is of Aboriginal descent. The sentencing judge was informed that she had two very young children from her relationship with Charles and, while in custody, those children were living with Ms Simpson’s mother. She has a minor, although not irrelevant, criminal record for offences of violence. On 12 April 2002 she was placed on a good behaviour bond for 12 months for an assault. That bond was current at the time of the commission of the present offence and is thus a further aggravating circumstance in her case. 
     
      
    18 Ms Simpson has suffered from alcohol and drug abuse. She was granted bail on 21 December 2002 and entered the drug rehabilitation programme run by the WHOS organisation. There was a report before the sentencing judge indicating that she had progressed to level three of the programme. On 24 April 2003 she entered the Weigelli Rehabilitation Centre and was participating in a course with that organisation until she was sentenced. 
     
      
    19 Dr Negus made it known to the court through the Crown Prosecutor that he had helped a number of persons with drug and alcohol problems and that Ms Simpson was the only person who had never asked him for money. He also wanted the court to be aware of his opinion that she was a “very much different person when under the influence of alcohol and drugs”. 
     
      
    20 There are three grounds of appeal in relation to Ms Simpson. The first ground contends that the sentencing judge erred in failing to reduce the non-parole period to reflect the period of pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    21 The applicant was in custody for the offence charged from 10 October 2002 until 21 December 2002, a period of two months and nine days. His Honour referred to this period and indicated that he was reducing the sentence from five and a half years to five years, three months and 21 days as a consequence. He then specified a non-parole period of 3 years. The sentence and non-parole period commenced from the date of sentence. 
     
      
    22 The complaint is that his Honour should have reduced the non-parole period to the same extent as he reduced the head sentence. It is argued that his Honour failed to follow the practice endorsed by this Court in R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588, where Street CJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is desirable sentencing practice that, where there has been a period of pre-sentence custody exclusively referable to the offences for which sentence is being passed, the commencement of the sentence (and the non-parole or non-probation period) should be back-dated for an equivalent period. This is to be preferred to a process of assessing the proper sentence (and non-parole or non-probation period) and allowing, as it were, a discount in consequence the pre-sentence custody. The desirable practice will promote the accuracy of the record, preventing there being a hidden factor affecting the length of the custody involved in consequence of the sentencing order. In addition, this practice will remove inequalities and unfairnesses as between prisoners arising from delays prior to sentencing, in particular in relation to remission or reduction entitlements; ………. A judge departing from this practice could be expected to indicate his reason for so doing. 
        
       
      
    23 It should be noted that McHugh was a case in which the appellant had continued in custody for a considerable period up to the date he was sentenced. This Court has repeatedly emphasised the importance of the practice being followed regardless of the different sentencing regimes in force from time to time. See, for example, R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245. However, it has been acknowledged that the sentencing judge can depart from the practice in an appropriate case and where reasons are given for doing so. See Leete (2001) 125 A Crim R 37. 
     
      
    24 It is trite law that a sentencing court must take into account the period served in pre-sentence custody where that period is referrable to the offence for which sentence is being passed. The court is required to take that matter into account by s 24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 47(3) of that Act also obliges the court to take time served into account when determining the commencement date of a sentence. 
     
      
    25 It is also trite law that the time spent in pre-sentence custody should be a matter to be considered in fixing the length of the non-parole period. In those cases where the sentence is backdated to a period before the sentence is imposed, the non-parole period will automatically be reduced by an amount equivalent to the reduction in the head sentence. This is because the non-parole period must begin on the date when the head sentence commences. 
     
      
    26 The difficulty arises in cases where, as here, the pre-sentence custody did not continue unbroken to the date of sentence. In such a case the court is faced with two options: it can simply state that the pre-sentence custody is being taken into account and reduce the sentence accordingly; or it can backdate the sentence even though the offender was not actually in custody on the date when the sentence is deemed to have commenced. Notwithstanding some doubt expressed about the latter practice in R v Sayak (NSWCCA, unreported, 16 September 1993), this Court has dealt with the matter in this way on more than one occasion. See R v McDonald (NSWCCA, unreported, 12 December 1995), R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309, and R v Phillips and Simpson [2002] NSWCCA 167. There is nothing in s 47 of the Act that would suggest that a court could not make such an order. 
     
      
    27 In my view, although there is an element of fiction involved in backdating a sentence to a period when the offender was not in custody, there is much to be said in its favour. Firstly, it preserves the denunciatory and deterrent value of the sentence to be pronounced. If a sentence is decreased by a substantial period already served in custody, it can have the appearance of being inadequate both to public perception and when it appears in the statistical information that is now so often relied upon by sentencing courts. This was one of the reasons expressed in McHugh for the adoption of the practice and it remains a highly important consideration. 
     
      
    28 In McDonald, a case in which a judge deferred passing sentence in light of the fact that the offender had spent 17 months in pre-sentence custody, this Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The first submission made on behalf of the Crown is that, even if (which is not conceded) Abadee J were right to conclude that the time already spent in custody by the respondent was adequate in the circumstances, this was not a case in which the matter should have been dealt with by a deferred sentence upon the respondent entering into a recognizance. The Crown argues that, if Abadee J had been minded to produce the practical result that the respondent, subject to appropriate assessment by the relevant authorities, spent little or no further time in custody, he could have achieved that result by back-dating a sentence of imprisonment to commence on 3 November 1993, and providing for a minimum term to end at about the time of sentencing, together with an additional term. That a sentencing judge has power to back-date a sentence, even in circumstances where the offender has been at large during the intervening period, is not in doubt. That not infrequently happens in this court, and, when it does, the court makes it clear that it is aware, in imposing its sentence, that the prisoner has been at large during part of the period the subject of the sentence. 
         
          
         
        We agree with the Crown's submission. There is a significant difference between serving a part of a sentence in the community, on parole, and being at liberty on a recognizance. In the former case, the offender is serving the sentence, although in the community. Breach of parole has certain immediate consequences. More important, the community sees that the offender is subjected to a sentence.  
        
       
       
      In that case, the Court backdated the sentence to the date upon which the respondent first went into custody, notwithstanding that he had been at liberty pending the determination of the Crown appeal; a period of over nine months. 
       
      
    29 The practice of backdating the sentence also makes it obvious to the offender that he, or she, has received a reduction in the sentence for the period already spent in custody. It ensures that there can be no argument, such as is now presently before this Court, as to whether the discount was in fact given even though the sentencing judge said that the time served in custody was taken into account in the sentence imposed. The importance of this aspect of sentencing was recognised in R v Phillips and Simpson and in R v Galati [2003] NSWCCA 148. In Galati James J, with whom Smart AJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [36]……………….It is true that, while a sentencing judge is required to take a period of pre-sentence custody into account, it is not obligatory for the sentencing judge to take the period of pre-sentence custody into account by the means of backdating the commencement of the sentence and that in  
        Howard 
         the Chief Judge at Common Law left open the option of reducing a sentence to be imposed so as to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody. However, in the present case, I consider that, notwithstanding the sentencing judge’s assertion in his remarks on sentence that he had taken into account the first period of presentence custody, the first period of presentence custody is not demonstrably reflected in the sentences which were imposed. The first two sentences, on which the other two sentences depend, were made to commence from 18 January 2002, a commencement date which would allow only for the second period of pre-sentence custody. The sentences which were imposed were for round periods of whole years, which tends to militate against any conclusion that an irregular period of one month and twenty six days was really taken into account. 
        
       
      
    30 The practice also avoids questions of disparity erroneously arising because a sentence, with which comparison is being made, has been markedly reduced by pre-sentence custody. Such a sentence, particularly where there are few comparable sentences for similar offences, can also skew the statistical information derived from sentences imposed by other courts and give a false indication of the range of sentences that have been imposed for a similar offence or on a similar offender. 
     
      
    31 The fourth, and probably less persuasive, reason for adopting this course is that it avoids lengthy sentences being imposed in terms of years, months and days, which, to my mind at least, looks faintly absurd and may suggest to the uninformed that sentencing is an exact science that can determine an appropriate period of imprisonment to a precise number of days. 
     
      
    32 I accept that the approach that was advocated in McHugh is a matter of practice and that a sentencing judge has a discretion as to how to take into account pre-sentence custody. See R v Nykolyn [2003] NSWCCA 229. But it should be emphasised once again that backdating is the preferable course and it should be adopted unless it is clearly inappropriate to do so. In Nykolyn Wood CJ at CL, with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed, stated at [33]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        While it was not strictly impermissible for her Honour to have reduced the non-parole period to account for the earliest period of pre-sentence custody, rather than backdating its commencement. I am not persuaded that there was necessarily an error in doing so. Had the applicant been given the full benefit of all of the pre-sentence custody in backdating the sentence and the non-parole period, the revocation of the earlier parole would have lost its effect. However the fact of the earlier period of custody was obviously a matter properly to be taken into account and which we should also take into account when we come to consider the balance of the matters relied upon, and in particular, the question of whether or not the sentence as a whole was excessive. 
        
       
      
    33 The present case is a good example of why the practice laid down in McHugh should continue to be applied and, in my opinion, the fact that a sentence would have to be backdated to a period when the offender was not in custody in order to comply with the practice is not a good reason for failing to follow it. In the present case, his Honour clearly reduced the head sentence by reason of the period served but there is a valid question arising as to whether the non-parole period was also reduced. 
     
      
    34 Of course, theoretically at least, a reduction in the head sentence should always bring about an equivalent reduction in the non-parole period. The non-parole period can never be considered in isolation but is always referable to the head sentence, at least under the sentencing scheme with which the Court is presently concerned. This must be so where no special circumstances are found, because then the non-parole period is a statutory percentage of the head sentence. But, where the court departs from the statutory relationship, there may be room for doubt about whether the offender received the entitlement unless the length of the non-parole period is such that it is obvious that the sentencing judge took into account the pre-sentence custody in calculating the length of the non-parole period. Questions arise, as they do here, where the term of the non-parole period does not appear to have the exactitude in calculation that was applied to determining the length of the head sentence. 
     
      
    35 As I am best able to calculate it, the non-parole period in the present case is 56 per cent of the head sentence. The applicant has to serve a minimum period of custody of three years before being eligible for release to parole. She then will have a period of nearly 2 years 4 months subject to parole supervision. This period is more than adequate, in my view, for the applicant’s rehabilitation.  
     
      
    36 Subject to any question of parity, which is raised by another ground of appeal, I believe that this ground should be rejected. While his Honour ought to have made it clear that he was taking into account the period of pre-trial custody in determining the non-parole period, and in my view should have backdated the sentence and non-parole period, I do not believe that the minimum period of custody should be further reduced. It was, in my opinion, a lenient non-parole period, even taking into account the period that the applicant had already served. I am not persuaded that, had his Honour backdated the sentence, as I believe he should have done, he would still have imposed a non-parole period of three years. Although he did not say so, there would have been no error in his Honour determining that the applicant should spend at least a further three years in custody before she could be released. 
     
      
    37 In any event I do not believe that any lesser sentence than that which the applicant now must serve is adequate to reflect the objective seriousness of her conduct and act as a general deterrent. The non-parole period was, even taking into account the period served before sentence, the very minimum that could have been imposed upon Ms Simpson. 
     
      
    38 The applicant has submitted that, by reason of her age, her relative lack of criminal record, the fact that it was her first sentence of imprisonment, the impact upon her mother and her children, her early plea and her immediate admission of guilt, the sentence was manifestly excessive. I do not agree. 
     
      
    39 This was clearly a most serious offence and she was the instigator of it. She knew that two men were to enter the premises of the victim in the early hours of the morning after she obtained entry for them by a ruse. She told police that, although she did not expect any violence, she knew that they were going to steal from him and it must have been obvious to her that there was going to be a confrontation between the men and the victim. His Honour described the offence as a “cowardly attack” upon the victim. Although that might have been an apt description of the role of the applicant Newman and Charles, her part in it was in some ways more repellent. 
     
      
    40 Ms Simpson knew the victim and had been helped by him in the past both morally and physically. He had been a support and comfort to her through difficult times. She returned that kindness and charity by instigating, planning and setting into motion the theft of his property simply to obtain money to purchase alcohol. But more than that, she knew how to gain entry to the premises notwithstanding the late hour and his apparent vigilance against intruders. She was aware of the one thing that he would be unable to resist: a call upon his Christian faith. She pretended that she wanted spiritual guidance, something that she had hitherto resisted. On that pretext she was able to achieve her plan of gaining entry for her two accomplices. 
     
      
    41 I accept that there was a difference in the criminality between the applicant and her two co-offenders, but I do not believe the gulf is as wide as the submissions on behalf of the applicant would suggest. It is clear that she was not only the means by which her co-offenders breached the security of the elderly man’s home. She was also intending to steal the victim’s property while he was distracted by the two men. The plea of guilty to the charge under s 113(3) accepts that she foresaw the possibility of the victim being wounded, and it, therefore, follows that she must have foreseen the possibility of there being some violence to the victim despite her protestations to the contrary. In any event, it is a matter of common sense that, if she allowed two men to gain entry to premises at night knowing that the occupant was at home and awake, there was going to be some sort of confrontation between the resident and the intruders and that it might well result in violence, not to the intruders, but to the vulnerable householder. 
     
      
    42 As his Honour recognised, there were a number of aggravating features in the offence, all of which applied to the applicant, either under s 113(2) or generally by reason of the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 or under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: These included the following: the offenders were in company; they knew the victim was in the premises alone; it was at night; the victim was an elderly and vulnerable person; there were injuries of a significant nature inflicted upon the victim; there was a degree of planning involved. In addition at the time the applicant was on conditional liberty for an offence of violence. 
     
      
    43 There was also, in my view, a significant breach of trust committed by the applicant: not in a technical sense but as a matter of practical reality. The applicant used her relationship with the victim to gain entry for herself and the two men in order to steal from him. Clearly he admitted her into his home, notwithstanding the late hour, because he believed she was alone and he trusted her. 
     
      
    44 It is clear that his Honour gave the applicant and her co-offenders a discount for the plea of guilty of 20 per cent. Although the Crown Prosecutor conceded that it was the first reasonable opportunity for the accused to plead to the indictment presented, the discount was appropriate in light of the plea coming at that stage in the proceedings. 
     
      
    45 The undiscounted sentence chosen by his Honour must have been about 7 years. As against a maximum penalty of 20 years and having regard to the aggravated features of this offence, I do not believe that such a sentence was outside his Honour’s discretionary range. I do not think that it could even be said to be at the top of the range for an offence with these aggravated objective facts. General deterrence was important and denunciation was essential. 
     
      
    46 As I have already indicated, I do not hold the view that the applicant’s criminality is substantially reduced from that of her co-offenders simply because she was not physically involved in the violence used against the victim or because she may not have intended that it occur. She was the instigator of, and a major participant in, an offence where she was aware of at least the possibility of the victim being wounded and she intentionally placed him into that peril. The criminal conduct of her co-offenders could not have occurred without her involvement in the offence. In my view she was to be appropriately punished for the resultant harm to the victim even though she did not actually participate in the conduct that caused it. She was not only criminally responsible for the harm inflicted upon the victim in a technical, legalistic sense, but she also bore moral responsibility that was to be reflected in an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    47 I do not accept that his Honour failed to take into account that the applicant was going to face her first custodial sentence. It was an obvious consideration once his Honour referred, as he did, to her criminal record. His failure to mention that fact does not mean that he did not take it into account and the sentence, in particular the non-parole period, discloses that he did. For my part, I simply cannot see any justification for a non-parole period less than that imposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    48 The fact that any custodial sentence was going to impact upon the innocent, such as her children and the applicant’s mother, is not a matter that can avail her. They are not highly exceptional circumstances and cannot justify the avoidance or reduction of an appropriate sentence to reflect the seriousness of her offence and the importance of general deterrence. See Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 and R v Bednarz [2000] NSWCCA 533. The effect of a sentence on third parties is not one of the mitigating factors specified in s 21A and it is not a matter of mitigation in the present case. 
     
      
    49 It follows that in my view the sentence imposed by his Honour was well within his discretion and there is no error apparent in his remarks or to be inferred from the sentence imposed. In those circumstances I should look at the question of parity. But before I do, I will consider the challenge to his sentence by the applicant Newman. 
     
      
    50 The grounds of appeal relied upon in the case of the applicant Newman are that the sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to his “deprived upbringing and background as a mitigating feature on sentence” and that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    51 His Honour was, with respect, correct not to distinguish the culpability of this applicant from his co-offender Charles. The applicant was part of the initial violent attack upon the victim. He was present when Charles punched the victim in the face and produced the knife with which he threatened the victim. He then left the room, presumably to look for property to steal and not to gain assistance for the victim. He certainly made no effort or attempt to restrain Charles. When he returned the victim was wounded and obviously hurt. Again, rather than remonstrating with his co-offender or seeking to assist the victim, he helped his co-offender throw a mattress over the top of the hapless victim, as he lay injured on the floor. 
     
      
    52 He then took the victim’s vehicle for his own personal use. He was charged with an offence of taking and driving the vehicle without consent and Judge Urquhart dealt with that matter on a Form 1. 
     
      
    53 The applicant was aged 23 years at the time of the offence. He has a significant criminal record dating from 1997. He received a sentence of imprisonment in 1999 for a number of dishonesty offences including break, enter and stealing. He has offences of violence and in November 2000 was sentenced to imprisonment for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In July 2002 he again received a gaol sentence for offences of violence including two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He had, on one occasion, received a bond with a term of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service, presumably in an endeavour to assist in his rehabilitation. There was no report from that Service requested for the purposes of his Honour sentencing him. 
     
      
    54 There was in evidence a psychological report setting out the applicant’s background, which is as follows. He has never met his natural father and had a poor relationship with his de facto stepfather, who, he believed favoured his natural children at the expense of the applicant. He has moved for much of his life between living at home and living with members of his extended family. He has never had stable employment. He had attempted suicide on two occasions, once because he was sick of life and the other after the end of a relationship. He began drinking alcohol at the age of 13 years, used cannabis from the age of 14 years and commenced using amphetamine intravenously at age 17. He had used heroin since being returned to custody for the present offence. 
     
      
    55 The applicant indicated to the psychologist that he was ashamed of the offence and that at the time he was in debt by reason of his drug usage. 
     
      
    56 Psychological testing indicated that he was in the Below Average range of intelligence. The psychologist opined that the applicant had “grown up with a sense of resentment about the circumstances of his birth and a perception that he has always been treated unfairly…[h]e acts out his anger and resentment in antisocial patterns of behaviour and self destructiveness”. The psychologist believed that the applicant was “emotionally and psychologically fragile and unstable and has attempted suicide twice in the recent past when he has perceived life was worst than usual”. She thought that the applicant might be a suitable candidate for an anger management course while in custody and that he needed urgent assistance for his drug usage. 
     
      
    57 Counsel for the applicant relied heavily upon the, well known, but frequently misunderstood, decision of Wood CJ at CL in Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 in which the Chief Judge set out a number of principles that guide the sentencing of persons who live, or have been brought up, in Aboriginal communities. The principles enunciated in that case are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""(A) The same sentencing principles are to be applied in every case irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group but that does not mean that the sentencing Court should ignore those facts which exist only by reason of the offender's membership of such a group. 
         
          
         
        (B) The relevance of the Aboriginality of an offender is not necessarily to mitigate punishment but rather to explain or throw light on the particular offence and the circumstances of the offender.  
         
         
        (C) It is proper for the Court to recognise that the problems of alcohol abuse and violence which to a very significant degree go hand in hand within Aboriginal communities are very real ones and their cure requires more subtle remedies than the criminal law can provide by way of imprisonment.  
         
         
        (D) Notwithstanding the absence of any real body of evidence demonstrating that the imposition of significant terms of imprisonment provides any effective deterrent in either discouraging the abuse of alcohol by members of the Aboriginal society or their resort to violence when heavily affected by it, the Courts must be very careful in the pursuit of their sentencing policies to not thereby deprive Aboriginals of the protection which it is assumed punishment provides. In short, a belief cannot be allowed to go about that serious violence by drunken persons within their society are treated by the law as occurrences of little moment.  
         
         
        (E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the Court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects.  
         
         
        (F) That in sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent the Court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt yet must nevertheless assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender.  
         
         
        (G) That in sentencing an Aborigine who has come from a deprived background or is otherwise disadvantaged by reasons of social or economic factors or who has little experience of European ways, a lengthy term of imprisonment may be particularly, even unduly, harsh when served in an environment which is foreign to him and which is dominated by inmates and prison officers of European background with little understanding of his culture and society or his own personality.  
         
         
        (H) That in every sentencing exercise, while it is important to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and not to lose sight of the objective seriousness of the offence in the midst of what might otherwise be attractive subjective circumstances, full weight must be given to the competing public interest to rehabilitation of the offender and the avoidance of recidivism on his part.""  
        
       
       
      Counsel for the applicant relied on (E) and (F) above. He stressed that the applicant had a significantly deprived background in which alcohol played a major part. 
       
      
    58 It is worth noting the background of the offender who was being sentenced by Wood CJ at CL. His Honour gave the following account of his personal circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
         
        His history is that of a semi-educated Aborigine from a large family with a deprived background. His parents and siblings at one time or another have all drunk to excess and his parents separated for that reason when he was relatively young. 
         
         
        At the age of 14 he was sent away by the welfare to an isolated property where he received training as a station hand from an elder member of his race. At the age of 16 he moved on to Queensland to get away from the welfare and there unfortunately he embarked upon the consumption of spirits and wine being barred because of his race from hotels.  
         
         
        He also worked around stations doing seasonal work, ringbarking and the like. After periods in the bush he was accustomed to return to town and drink heavily for several days.  
         
         
        At the age of 18 he became introduced to tent boxing and he joined a troupe travelling around Australia for 12 months or so. It may be assumed that he had several fights each day in the poorly supervised conditions of the tents and he was knocked out several times.  
         
         
        Since then he has largely worked in and around the Walgett area doing the work of a station hand, cotton chipping, shearing, ringbarking and the like. 
        
       
       
      The offence was described by his Honour as being “impulsive and totally unpremeditated”. The offender was so intoxicated that he lacked the specific intention required for more serious offences than that with which he was being sentenced. 
       
      
    59 The present applicant is described in written submissions on his behalf as being “of Aboriginal descent”. Assuming that was a relevant matter, there was no evidence of that fact before the sentencing judge. The psychologist stated that at one stage in his early teens the applicant was keen to locate his father, “whom he believes is Aboriginal”. He lost interest in this pursuit when he learned that his father “was probably a copper”. The only other suggestion of his possible ancestry is that he believed he was darker-skinned than the other children at school and so ended up in fights. However, the sentencing judge was addressed on the basis that the applicant was an Aboriginal and the Crown raised no objection. His Honour did not mention the applicant’s racial origins. The applicant was not at the hearing of this appeal. 
     
      
    60 In any event, there was nothing in the material that indicated that his Aboriginality was a relevant matter and the reference in the submissions to the case of Fernando is, in my view, completely misguided. There was not the slightest material before the sentencing judge to suggest that the principles enunciated in that case had any relevance to the sentencing of the applicant. Neither that decision nor those principles were referred to during the sentencing hearing. They were not, in my opinion, engaged by anything said by his legal representative to the sentencing judge. In particular, contrary to the submission made on the applicant’s behalf in this Court, they did not arise from the following submission made to Judge Urquhart: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I would simply ask your Honour to place this person and this crime in context, to accept that that is the person who committed the crime; that he is a young Aboriginal man who is quite deprived; has some very difficult problems; whilst seriously intoxicated was involved in what I’d say again is an opportunistic offence, in that the wounding was opportunistic in it happened in the context of the crime which was initially intended to be much, much less severe. 
        
       
      
    61 It has been pointed out on numerous occasions by this Court, including those benches of which the Chief Judge has been a member, that the principles and statements set out in Fernando have to be read in context. It is not every case of deprivation and disadvantage suffered by an offender of Aboriginal race or ancestry that requires, or even justifies, the special approach adopted in that case. In light of the submissions placed before this Court, and which were the substantial basis upon which we were asked to intervene, it is probably as well to set out again those cases that have considered the application of the Fernando principles. 
     
      
    62 In Ceissman (2001) 119 A Crim R 535, Wood CJ at CL, with whom Ipp JA agreed, made comment about the limited application of the principles in Fernando to, and the misapplication of them in, the case then under consideration. It was a Crown appeal, one of the grounds being that the sentencing judge misapplied Fernando. In allowing the appeal the Chief Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        29 Next, it appears to me that his Honour was at risk of mis-applying the decision in  
        Fernando 
         (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, referred to with approval in  
        Stone 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 218. As I endeavoured to explain in  
        Fernando 
        , the eight propositions there enunciated were not intended to mitigate the punishment of persons of Aboriginal descent, but rather to highlight those circumstances that may explain or throw light upon the particular offence, or upon the circumstances of the particular offender which are, referable to their Aboriginality, particularly in the context of offences arising from the abuse of alcohol.  
         
         
        30 The present is not such a case, nor is it one which needs to be understood as having occurred in a particular local or rural setting, or one involving an offender from a remote community for whom imprisonment would be unduly harsh because it was to be served in an environment that was foreign to him or her. 
         
         
        31 That  
        Fernando 
         is not to be regarded as a decision justifying special leniency, merely because of the Aboriginality of the offender, was recognised in  
        Hickey 
         NSW CCA 27 September 1994 where Simpson J noted that the first of the propositions stated by me in that decision ""is that sentencing principles are non-discriminatory in that they apply to all accused without differentiating by reason of the offender’s membership of a particular racial or ethnic group"". This proposition is however varied by the recognition that those factors which constitute the disadvantage, and which may arise by reason of membership of the particular group, may have a role to play in the sentencing determination. 
         
         
        32 The principles stated should not be elevated so as to create a special class of persons for whom leniency is inevitably to be extended, irrespective of the objective and special circumstances of the case. To do so would itself be discriminatory of others. 
         
         
        33 In the instant case, I am unable to see the existence of any factor arising from the fact that the respondent's grandfather was part Aboriginal, that would, in accordance with  
        Fernando, 
         attract special consideration. That does not mean that his subjective circumstances were to be ignored or diminished. It simply means that  
        Fernando 
         did not require the application of any consideration additional to those applicable in every case of an offender with a deprived background.  
        
       
      
    63 In R v Pitt [2001] NSWCCA 156 Wood CJ at CL, with whom Sully J agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [19]  
        As I pointed out in Ceissman (2001) NSWCCA 73, there is a danger of misinterpreting Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 as a decision justifying special leniency on account of an offender’s Aboriginality. The error in that approach was recognised in Hickey NSWCCA 27 September 1994, where Simpson J noted that the first of the eight propositions stated by me in Fernando, was “that sentencing principles are not discriminatory in that they apply to all accused without differentiating by reason of the offender’s membership of a particular racial or ethnic group.” 
         
         
        [20]  
        In Powell, Simpson J similarly noted that it is a mistake to rely on Fernando as authority for a proposition that Aboriginal heritage of itself is a mitigating circumstance, and warned that care must be taken to ensure that recognition of the social and economic problems that frequently attend Aboriginal communities, and the principles stated in Fernando, do not have the unintended consequence of devaluing the effect of offences on victims. 
         
         
        [21]  
        What Fernando sought to do was to give recognition to the fact that disadvantages which arise out of membership of a particular group, which is economically, socially or otherwise deprived to a significant and systemic extent, may help to explain or throw light upon the particular offence and upon the individual circumstances of the offender. In that way an understanding of them may assist in the framing of an appropriate sentencing order that serves each of the punitive, rehabilitative and deterrent objects of sentencing. 
        
       
      
    64 In R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28, when allowing a Crown Appeal against the respondent who was an Aboriginal, the Chief Justice, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Kirby J agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [66]  
        The sentencing principles to be applied by a sentencing court apply in every case, irrespective of the membership of the particular offender of an ethnic or other group. Nevertheless, when imposing sentences courts must take into account, pursuant to those very principles of general application, all of the facts relevant to the circumstances of the offence and of the offender, including facts which may exist by reason of the person’s membership of a particular group. (See eg Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305 at 326.) 
         
         
        [67]  
        Aborigines who commit crimes of violence are not accorded special treatment by the imposition of lighter sentences than would otherwise be appropriate having regard to all of the relevant considerations, including the subjective features of a particular case. An offender is not entitled to any special leniency by reason of his or her Aboriginality. The principle of equality before the law requires sentencing to occur without differentiation by reason of the offender’s membership of any particular racial or ethnic group. Nevertheless, particular mitigating factors may feature more frequently in some such groups than they do in others. (See R v Fernando (1992) 72 ACrimR 58 at 62-63 as further explained in R v Hickey (NSWCCA, 27 September 1994; unreported); R v Stone (1995) 84 ACrimR 218 at 221-223; R v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73 esp at [29]-[33]; R v Pitt [2001] NSWCCA 156 at [19]-[21]. 
         
         
        [68]  
        The criminal justice system has accurately been described as a “hopelessly blunt instrument of social policy and its implementation by the courts is a totally inadequate substitute for improved education, health, housing and employment for Aboriginal communities” R v Daniel [1998] 1 Qd R 499 at 530 per Fitzgerald P. His Honour outlined the difficulties that arise in this regard at 530-532. 
         
         
        [69]  
        The circumstances of the present case are, regrettably, repeated across the entire community. This Court frequently hears appeals from young people who have suffered deprivation in their personal life, have succumbed to addiction - usually first to marijuana and then to heroin - and committed crimes of burglary and armed robbery in order to acquire funds to feed the habit. 
        
       
      
    65 In R v Morgan (2003) 57 NSWLR 533 Wood CJ at CL, with whom Simpson and Adams JJ, agreed, having referred to what his Honour said in the original Fernando case stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [20] As has been made clear by subsequent decisions, these remarks were not intended as an exhaustive statement of sentencing practice, or as justifying any special leniency in relation to offenders of the class to whom they applied: R v Hickey NSWCCA 27 September 1994, R v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73 and R v Pitt [2001] 156. 
         
         
        [21] Rather they were intended to reflect an understanding of some of the factors which can lead a person of this racial background into offending behaviour, and which, in appropriate cases, may have a particular relevance for the way in which a sentencing order may suitably be framed. They can have also a particular relevance for persons appearing before the courts who come from remote parts of the country, and who have particularly disadvantaged backgrounds, or when the offence is alcohol-related. 
         
         
        [22] The present offences were not alcohol-related and the appellant did not come from a remote community, nor was he unfamiliar with the justice system. While the “Fernando considerations” could properly be taken into account, they added little to the present sentencing exercise beyond those matters which would otherwise have been taken into account, for any offender, as subjective circumstances. They were not favourable, but they did point to the need for a sentence that took into account the rehabilitative aspects, particularly in relation to post release supervision and assistance. 
        
       
      
    66 Counsel for the applicant relied upon the decision of this Court, comprised by a two judge bench, in R v Powell [2000] NSWCCA 108; a decision referred to by Wood CJ at CL in Pitt and in which Simpson J cautioned against the misuse of Fernando. But that was a case in which the principles and approach adopted in Fernando were clearly applicable. The applicant was a young Aboriginal who began drinking alcohol at an early age while living on an Aboriginal reserve. It was a case where there was a clear relationship between his Aboriginality and the circumstances in which he found himself in an “entrenched pattern of disadvantage”. 
     
      
    67 In the present case the applicant commenced drinking alcohol at an early stage in his life and progressed eventually to the misuse of drugs. He was heavily intoxicated on the evening of the offence. The psychologist reports that the applicant “began drinking at age thirteen and did so every weekend with mates in Narromine. After he left school in mid-teens he said he was ‘drinking with old mates’ who were alcoholics”. This account of his drinking habits did not itself, or when taken into account with any other feature of the applicant’s life, justify, let alone require, the sentencing judge applying, or even referring to, the decision of Fernando and the principles set out in it. It is perhaps worth noting that the applicant was represented by the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service and his legal representative did not apparently think that the decision was sufficiently relevant to refer to it. 
     
      
    68 Even assuming that the applicant is of Aboriginal ancestry, this is not a case where any special consideration is due to the applicant on that account. The background of the applicant, while lamentable, is not in any way unique nor is it restricted to any particular community group. Those in society who abuse alcohol and drugs are almost invariably persons who have suffered some type of deprivation or abuse early in life and, as a result, suffer from low self-regard, depression and pessimism. 
     
      
    69 The sentencing judge referred to matters in the applicant’s background obtained from the psychologist’s report and it should not be inferred that he did not take them into account when determining the sentence simply because he did not state that he was doing so. His Honour found special circumstances by reason of the applicant’s youth, but that in itself would not justify such a finding in light of the applicant’s criminal record. It is clear that his Honour took into account the need for the applicant’s rehabilitation, even though he found that “he has much ground to cover to progress his motivation for rehabilitation”. His Honour made specific mention of the psychologist referring the applicant to a programme in gaol for the prevention of violence. 
     
      
    70 It has been submitted that, in light of the applicant’s background and personal difficulties, his Honour erred in determining a starting sentence of 10 years imprisonment. I do not agree. The offence was very serious and the applicant’s role in it substantial. He was a participant in the initial violence to the victim. In view of his criminal history and the nature of the offence, it was open to his Honour to give little weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances, including the fact that he was of below average intelligence The applicant’s use of alcohol was not a matter that had to be taken as a mitigating factor in light of the applicant’s criminal record and notwithstanding his Aboriginality. Although the applicant told the psychologist that he did not know of the existence of a knife, there is no reason why his Honour should have found that to be a fact. The applicant refused to participate in a police interview and did not give evidence. Statements of facts contained in reports should not be uncritically accepted in the absence of evidence from the applicant. See R v Niketic [2002] NSWCCA 425 and Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174. 
     
      
    71 Although a related offence, the taking and using of the victim’s motor vehicle was a matter that was properly to be reflected in the sentence for the offence on the indictment. As counsel for the applicant conceded, the sentence imposed was within the range for an offence under s 113(3), although he submitted it fell within the upper regions of that range. In my view it was appropriate that it did so. 
     
      
    72 I must now consider whether, in light of the sentences imposed upon the applicant Newman and Charles, the applicant Simpson has a justifiable sense of grievance. There is no need to review in this, already overly-lengthy, judgment the principles upon which this Court exercises its discretion to intervene on the basis of disparity. 
     
      
    73 The ground is based upon two factors as a result of which, it is argued, Ms Simpson should have received a lesser sentence than she did when comparison is made with the sentences imposed upon her co-offenders. The first is that, as the trial judge recognised, the applicant was not involved in the assaults upon the victim nor was she present in the room when they occurred. As I have already indicated, I am of the view that these matters carry little weight when regard is had to her legal, moral and factual responsibility for the injuries that resulted from her conduct in allowing the men into the house. As I have already remarked, she placed the victim in this peril and she did so having at least a foresight of the possibility of physical harm resulting. 
     
      
    74 The other matter relied upon in this ground of appeal is the difference between the applicant’s criminal record and that of her co-offenders. While it is true that it was not as extensive and she had never served a gaol term before, she was on a bond for an offence of violence at the time. 
     
      
    75 This is a case where a single judge sentenced the three offenders on the one occasion. It was principally a matter for the exercise of his discretion to determine relative criminality and the impact of the subjective circumstances of each. I am far from persuaded that he erred in that task or that the applicant can have any justifiable sense of grievance at the sentence she received, which, as I have already indicated, was a lenient one given her criminality. 
     
      
    76 It is clear then that in my view the appeals should be dismissed as no error has been shown that would warrant interference by this Court. It is, therefore, unnecessary to have regard to the considerable amount of fresh evidence placed before the Court that was to be considered if the applicant Simpson was to be re-sentenced. Nevertheless, I wish to make some brief observations on that material. 
     
      
    77 This case is a good example of a trend that appears to be developing where the proper subjective case for the offender is presented before this Court rather than before the sentencing judge. The consequence is that, if any error can be shown, this Court will have to undertake the re-sentencing exercise on a subjective case, which, if not different to that placed before the sentencing judge, contains considerably more material in amplification of matters that were raised at first instance and, not infrequently, through submissions from the bar table. As I have already indicated, there was scant material placed before the sentencing judge notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence, the inevitability of Ms Simpson being sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment, and the subjective material that has now been presented to this Court and which should have been placed before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    78 It should be clearly understood that such material will not be taken into account by this Court unless some error of law has been shown in the exercise of discretion by the sentencing judge and which is of such a nature that this Court is required to re-exercise that discretion. In the present case, had I formed the view that the non-parole period should be adjusted in order to take into account the period served in pre-sentence custody, I would not have considered the fresh material and re-sentenced the applicant upon it. 
     
      
    79 The second matter concerns the tender of letters written by the victim in which he expresses his forgiveness of Ms Simpson and states his view that the sentence was, in her case, excessive. Clearly the view of the victim as to the appropriateness of the sentence is irrelevant, and Ms Cox who appears for Ms Simpson did not rely upon it. However, Ms Cox submitted that, if the Court was required to re-sentence the applicant, it should take into account the attitude of the victim to Ms Simpson and her involvement in the offence. 
     
      
       
      
    80 In Palu I said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [37] The attitude of the victim cannot be allowed to interfere with a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. This is so whether the attitude expressed is one of vengeance or of forgiveness: R v Glen (NSWCCA, unreported, 19 December 1994). Sentencing proceedings are not a private matter between the victim and the offender, not even to the extent that the determination of the appropriate punishment may involve meting out retribution for the wrong suffered by the victim. A serious crime is a wrong committed against the community at large and the community is itself entitled to retribution. In particular, crimes of violence committed in public are an affront to the peace and good order of the community and require deterrent sentences: Henderson (NSWCCA, unreported, 5 November 1997). Matters of general public importance are at the heart of the policies and principles that direct the proper assessment of punishment, the purpose of which is to protect the public, not to mollify the victim. 
        
       
       
      This statement was recently applied by Kirby J in  
      R v Huynh 
       [2003] NSWSC 1066. 
       
      
    81 Although Ms Cox sought to distinguish that case from the present on the basis of the different offences involved, I believe that the statement of principle applies equally to a home invasion. Such an offence is as much, if not more, an affront to the peace and good order of the community as is a street fight. 
     
      
    82 Although victims of crimes are entitled to make a statement to the court as to the effect of the crime for which sentence is being passed upon them, they are not entitled to express their views as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed, the matters to be taken into account by the sentencing judge, or, their personal opinions of the offender. See R v Walsh and Sharp [2004] NSWSC 111 and s 28(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    83 This is not to suggest that there may be the comparatively rare cases where forgiveness of the accused by the victim may be a relevant fact. Most cases, where this issue has been considered, have been in the context of domestic violence. 
     
      
    84 In R v Bradford (NSWCCA, unreported, 6 May 1988) the offence was one of malicious wounding with intent committed by an offender on his wife when she indicated that she was going to leave him and end the marriage. After the offender stabbed his wife, he slashed his own throat and wrists in a suicide attempt. The wife eventually returned to live with the offender and forgave him, expressing the view that the charge should not be prosecuted. In that context and having regard to the fact that the offender was aged 53 years with no criminal record, this Court accepted that the attitude of the victim was a relevant consideration. Street CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Cases of this nature are notoriously difficult when it comes to the matter of sentence. One must, of course, recognise the very real concern of the victim of such an offence and the potential victims of similar offences. In this instance the attitude of the victim is manifested by her having returned to live with the appellant. It does not of course lie in the hands of a victim to determine what punishment should be meted out for a criminal offence. Punishment can properly be tempered in the light of the victim’s attitude. But the community’s interest in ensuring law abiding conduct by its citizens must be given due weight when determining the sentence in a case such as this. 
        
       
      
    85 R v Glen (NSWCCA, unreported, 19 December 1994) was an appeal against conviction and sentence for an offence of sexual intercourse committed by the offender against his wife. The wife had indicated that she did not want the offender to go to gaol and wished to give evidence on his behalf. As to an argument that the sentencing judge failed to take a number of mitigating factors into account including the attitude of the wife, Grove J, with whom Loveday AJ agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        None of these matters was overlooked by the sentencing judge. In particular, he made express reference to the attitude of the complainant. It cannot be that the attitude of complainants can govern the duty of a court when proceeding to sentence. As has been pointed out elsewhere, the adoption of such a practice or philosophy would involve taking into account the desires of unforgiving complainants for vengeance or salutary penalty. 
        
       
       
       
       
      Simpson J stated: 
       
        
         
        There are two main arguments of principle against the proposition that this Court should give any weight to the expressed wish of the victim in this case that the applicant not be incarcerated. The first concerns the importance, especially great in cases of domestic violence, given the history that I have alluded to, of general deterrence. This Court must send a signal to domestic violence offenders that, regardless of self interest denying forgiveness on the part of victims, those victims will nevertheless receive the full protection of the law, insofar as the courts are able to afford it to them. It must not be forgotten, that, if it is to be accorded weight by the courts, forgiveness by the victim also operates contrary to the interests of other victims. Until it is recognised that domestic violence will be treated with severe penalties regardless of a later softening of attitude by the victim, no progress is likely to be made in its abolition or reduction. Put simply, the importance of general deterrence in such cases overrides any minor relevance that evidence of forgiveness might have. 
        
       
       
      The second matter referred to by her Honour concerned the existence of legislation compelling complainants to give evidence in domestic violence offences and Simpson J was of the view that the policy behind such a provision equally applied to receiving evidence of the victim’s post-offence attitude. 
       
      
    86 The remarks by Simpson J, set out above, were expressly approved in Rowe (1996) 89 A Crim R 467 at 472 and applied in Kanj (2000) 118 A Crim R 329.  
     
      
    87 In my view, the present offence is one where general deterrence is so important, denunciation so significant, and the objective facts so serious that there can be no role for the victim’s attitude to play in the Court fulfilling its duty to impose an appropriate sentence to reflect those aspects of punishment. 
     
      
    88 In my opinion the Court should order that the applications for leave to appeal be granted but the appeals dismissed. 
     
      
    89 SHAW J: These are two applications for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the applicants by the District Court at Griffith on 7 May 2003. 
     
      
    90 The offences in relation to which pleas of guilty were entered arise under s 111(3) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and amount, in substance, to charges that the applicants entered a dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, mainly stealing, with wounding. 
     
      
    91 I have had the benefit of seeing in draft the detailed reasons of my colleague Howie J and thus it is unnecessary for me to recount the detailed facts and circumstances of the case. But it is pertinent to observe that the offenders were drug users who sought to obtain money for the purchase of drugs and/or alcohol and that they went to the home of the victim in order to obtain that money. 
     
      
    92 This was obviously a very serious offence and a significant penalty was called for. Accordingly, I respectfully agree with much that Howie J has said and, in particular the importance of general deterrence in cases of this kind. 
     
      
    93 The question before this court, is, however, whether the penalty imposed by the sentencing court was manifestly excessive. In assessing this, it is relevant in my opinion to take into account that the victim whose home was invaded was significantly injured, requiring stitches to various parts of his body, a fractured cheekbone, broken ribs and a bruised kidney and also incurred nerve damage to his face.  
     
      
    94 In relation to Mr Newman, the sentencing judge sentenced him to imprisonment for eight years, expiring on 9 October 2010, with a specified non-parole period of five years. The other applicant in this appeal Ms Simpson was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, 3 months and 21 days, with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
    95 As I have emphasised, significant penalties were called for and I would give great weight to the discretion of the sentencing judge dealing with matters of this kind. 
     
      
    96 It was expressly put to the sentencing judge that the crime needed to be placed in its context, that is to say references were made to the offender (Newman) being a young aboriginal man who is quite deprived and has difficult problems, and he was contrite expressly conceding that he had done something “totally wrong”. There was material before the sentencing judge that a psychologist indicated his “shame” about the conduct and there was an acceptance of a prison sentence. The contrition was evidenced by a plea of guilty upon the applicants’ arraignment before the District Court, that is the first occasion on which the matter was before that court.97 So far as I can ascertain the detailed written statements of the victim (Dr Negus) were not placed before the sentencing judge, but they are before this court in the event that the court determines to re-sentence the applicants. However, what was put forward by counsel for Ms Simpson was that: “… so far as the female is concerned Dr Negus has specifically asked me to say to the court that he has helped a number of young people so far as drug and alcohol problems are concerned, and she, so far as he could recall, was the only one that never asked for money up until the time of this offence. And that further, he asked me to tell the court, so far as he was able to observe, she was very much a different person when under the influence of drugs or alcohol.” (Transcript p 8, 6 May 2003). 
     
      
      By letter of 2 March 1996, the victim expressed the view that the sentence on Ms Simpson was too harsh and that he would be happy to assist to have it reduced. He refers to the apology proffered to him immediately after the sentence was imposed, that she was forgiven and that her part in the incident was “over and forgotten.” It was said that she played no part in the violence, and that the sooner she got out of prison the better for her, and the children so she can be helped “to get her life together.” 
       
      
    98 Counsel for the two applicants have submitted what are, in my view, cogent reasons why the sentence and/or the non-parole period should be reduced to some extent. They have rightly conceded the seriousness of the offences but have pressed upon this court a number of mitigating factors. I am unable to accede to the proposition that the fact that the applicants were under the effect of alcohol should play a significant role in the sentencing process. Nor am I much influenced by the proposition that Mr Newman was below average intelligence, although it does seem to me to be relevant that Mr Newman was unaware of the presence of a weapon carried by a co-accused, that both applicants were relatively young people without a vast prior criminal history, and that there were early pleas of guilty in both cases. I note that Mr Newman has been previously convicted for assaults occasioning actual bodily harm and for break, enter and steal with intent, and for other offences. However, he was not on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the currently relevant offence. Ms Simpson does not have an extensive record of criminal convictions although she does have convictions for malicious damage, assault of a police officer and common assault. She was on a 12 month bond which was in force when she committed the offence which resulted in the current sentence. 
     
      
    99 There is a clear element of aggravation involved in this offence, namely the wounding of the victim. It also has to be acknowledged that the conduct of Ms Simpson was deceptive and active in the sense that she tapped on the windows of the victim’s house and said, I take it disingenuously, “I want to talk to you about becoming a Christian” which resulted in the victim unlocking the door and letting the applicants enter the house. A person who is not an applicant in these proceedings assaulted the victim and produced a knife. The actual injury suffered by the victim was inflicted by that person. 
     
      
    100 Against the arguments of counsel for the applicants are the factors that the maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature for this offence is imprisonment for 20 years and that the sentencing judge has provided careful and considered remarks on sentence. I am unable to disagree with the conclusion of the sentencing judge that what was involved amounted to a “cowardly physical attack” on a 67 year old victim, although his Honour was correct in saying that those actions may not have been actively participated in by the current applicants, Mr Newman and Ms Simpson, and I think that his Honour was correct in finding that the role of Ms Simpson must be seen as less than the role of the other 2 participants. I also acknowledge that his Honour has carefully had regard to the statutory criteria prescribed as the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on a person who has committed an offence. His Honour also expressly allowed an element of discount because of an early plea of guilty, although I am of the view that a discount of 25% would have been more appropriate than the 20% applied: R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    101 Only two matters concern me in this case which involve questions of possible reconsideration by this court of the sentences. But they are, in my view, matters of significance. One is the aboriginality of the 2 applicants and the second is the remarkably charitable attitude of the victim towards the way in which the sentencing process should be dealt with. I turn to deal with those 2 considerations. 
     
      
    102 As I apprehend it, it was not in dispute at trial, nor in this court on appeal, that the 2 applicants were aborigines. In my opinion, although the approach to sentencing should be non-discriminatory, relevant regard can be taken in relation to persons from a background of socio-economic disadvantage which may be associated with growing up as an indigenous citizen of this country. This is not a matter to which the sentencing judge adverted. Yet, it seems to me that the carefully crafted principles in the case of Stanley Edward Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 were applicable. In that case Wood J in this court formulated, having regard to a series of earlier judgments, a number of propositions as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (A) The same sentencing principles are to be applied in every case irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group but that does not mean that the sentencing court should ignore those facts which exist only by reason of the offenders' membership of such a group.  
         
        (B) The relevance of the Aboriginality of an offender is not necessarily to mitigate punishment but rather to explain or throw light on the particular offence and the circumstances of the offender.  
         
        (C) It is proper for the court to recognise that the problems of alcohol abuse and violence which to a very significant degree go hand in hand within Aboriginal communities are very real ones and their cure requires more subtle remedies than the criminal law can provide by way of imprisonment.  
         
        (D) Notwithstanding the absence of any real body of evidence demonstrating that the imposition of significant terms of imprisonment provides any effective deterrent in either discouraging the abuse of alcohol by members of the Aboriginal society or their resort to violence when heavily affected by it, the courts must be very careful in the pursuit of their sentencing policies to not thereby deprive Aboriginals of the protection which it is assumed punishment provides. In short, a belief cannot be allowed to go about that serious violence by drunken persons within their society are treated by the law as occurrences of little moment.  
         
        (E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects.  
         
        (F) That in sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent the court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt yet must nevertheless assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender.  
         
        (G) That in sentencing an Aborigine who has come from a deprived background or is otherwise disadvantaged by reason of social or economic factors or who has little experience of European ways, a lengthy term of imprisonment may be particularly, even unduly, harsh when served in an environment which is foreign to him and which is dominated by inmates and prison officers of European background with little understanding of his culture and society or his own personality.  
         
        (H) That in every sentencing exercise, while it is important to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and not to lose sight of the objective seriousness of the offence in the midst of what might otherwise be attractive subjective circumstances, full weight must be given to the competing public interest to rehabilitation of the offender and the avoidance of recidivism on his part.  
         
        Those then are the principles which I propose to bring to bear in this difficult case. Against the subjective severity of the offence involving as it does the use of a knife to inflict substantial wounds by a man with some record for prior violence and who was on a recognisance at the time are to be weighed the following features: 
         
         
          
          (a) His deprived background and involuntary removal at an early age to an isolated mission property.  
           
          (b) His early introduction to alcohol and longstanding abuse of it within communities where regrettably such conduct is not only the norm but positively encouraged by peer group pressure.  
           
          (c) The fact that he was exposed to a very significant gaol sentence when a young man for an offence which today in the case of an offender in his position would not have justified such an outcome which was then followed by numerous brushes with the criminal law for conduct which today again would not have attracted such attention.  
           
          (d) His favourable record for gainful work and his desire to advance that record by seeking full-time station work.  
           
          (e) The fact that he was substantially disinhibited by alcohol at the time of the offence.  
           
          (f) The steps that he has already taken towards breaking his alcohol problem and his greater awareness of the need for it.  
          
         
        (g) His obvious remorse and contrition.  
         
          
          (h) The fact that the victim has substantially forgiven him and would prefer that he not go to gaol.  
           
          (i) His early plea of guilty which the Crown accepted to a lesser charge but in full satisfaction of the indictment.  
           
          (j) The fact that his earlier record almost exclusively, if not entirely, is alcohol-related and displays some significant periods of freedom from criminality.  
           
          (k) The fact that he has in the past observed the conditions of recognisances and also has satisfactorily fulfilled the requirements of community service orders.  
           
          (l) The indications that he may possibly have some organic brain damage due either to the effects of alcohol or fighting or possibly both which are likely to have affected his behavioural controls particularly when affected by alcohol.  
          
         
        
       
       
      I emphasise, as did his Honour in that case, that the relevance of aboriginality is not necessarily to mitigate “but rather to explain or throw light on a particular offence and the circumstances of the offender.” That judgment also notes the correlation of alcohol abuse and violence with some Aboriginal communities and a need for “more subtle remedies” than might ordinarily be provided. I respectfully agree with his Honour’s crystallisation of those principles.  
       
      
    103 As I understand it, the Crown does not dispute that Fernando, although not referred to, or aboriginality, although not referred to at first instance, is of some relevance. Rather, the Crown says that the subsequent considerations by the courts of Fernando limits its effect, and in any event the sentences were in all of the circumstances appropriate and justifiable. 
     
      
    104 I propose to consider the way in which Fernando has been subsequently dealt with in this and other jurisdictions in Australia. In Scott Andrew Stone  (1995) 84 A Crim R 218 James J observed the argument that the principles articulated by Wood J could be significantly if not totally “eroded” on the basis that a defendant in a criminal case had committed similar serious offences in the past. However (at page 224) his Honour held that in the circumstances of that case the sentencing judge erred in giving only limited effect to the principles stated in Fernando on the ground that the applicant had committed similar serious offences in the past. His Honour went on to say that, although the offences were objectively serious, 
     
      
       
        
         “ … the seriousness of the offences was to some extent mitigated by the circumstances that the offences were not premeditated, that the applicant could quite readily have formed the impression that a young fellow Aborigine ….. was being arrested by the police for no good reason, and that the weapon which the applicant used was not a weapon such as a knife or a gun which he had been carrying …” 
        
       
       
      Newman J agreed with James J and said that the earlier judgment of Simpson J in this court in  
      Hickey 
       (unreported), 20 September 1994 CCA, NSW, reflected the fact that her Honour “fully approved of Wood J’s statements of principle” in  
      Fernando 
      . In  
      Maynard Daniel  
      (1997) 94 A Crim R 96 (Qld) the Court of Appeal in Queensland considered the question of the sentencing of aborigines. I agree with the dissenting judge in that case (Fitzgerald P) who set out in detail and applied the principles formulated by Wood J in relation to this difficult question (p 113). In doing so, his Honour cited the observations of Kirby ACJ in  
      Russell  
       (1995) 84 A Crim R 386 to the effect that “the circumstances for considering aboriginality as a legitimate concern in sentencing” had been explained in  
      Fernando 
      . Whilst the majority of the court disagreed with Fitzgerald P in his Honour’s proposition that the eligibility for parole should have been varied, it does not seem to me that there was any significant difference in point of principle. Moynihan J drew attention (at p 130) to the impact of cultural or other considerations in the sentencing process and to the fact that the trial judge was aware of and had adverted to such factors. The majority held that the sentencing judge considered all relevant considerations and declined to grant an application for leave to appeal against sentence (McPherson JA agreed with Moynihan J). The Court of Criminal Appeal in the Northern Territory in  
      Inness Wurramara 
       (1999) 105 A Crim R 512 at [34] cited the judgment of Wood J in  
      Fernando,  
      in a particular context, where it was said that members of an aboriginal community should not be deprived of the protection of the criminal law, but expressed no general disagreement with the factors articulated in  
      Fernando.  
       In  
      R v Powell  
       [2000] NSWCCA 108 at [15] Smart AJ emphasised that violent acts in domestic situations must be regarded with real seriousness. His Honour noted the principal attack of the applicant on the sentencing process to the effect that there had been a failure to consider the principles referred to in  
      Fernando 
      , and that, in particular, there had been a background of growing up in an area where alcohol consumption was the norm and that the family background of the applicant was distressing and disadvantaged. The sentencing judge in that case had noted the submissions made by counsel for the defendant but “did not herself embark upon any of the considerations referred to in  
      Fernando 
      .” His Honour said at [17] that:  
       
       
        
         
          
          this was a case where those principles [that is  
          Fernando 
          ] should have been applied. The valiant effort made by the Crown to suggest, in effect that the judge applied the  
          Fernando  
          principles and, alternatively, that they had no weight in this case cannot succeed. The applicant has established error and this court must re-sentence.  
          
         
        
       
       
      It is true that, in the result of that case, the appeals against sentence on each of the counts were dismissed, except the appeal against sentence on a count of malicious wounding was allowed and a variation was made to the minimum term of imprisonment which had been imposed at first instance. Simpson J agreed with the orders proposed and emphasised that it was “a mistake” to rely on  
      Fernando  
      as authority for a proposition that aboriginal heritage is “of itself” a mitigating circumstance. Rather, her Honour explained  
      Fernando 
       as an acknowledgment that:  
       
       
        
        the well-known social and economic problems that frequently attend aboriginal communities warrant a degree of leniency, but it is the disadvantage associated too often with Aboriginality that warrants that degree of leniency and not the fact of Aboriginality, per se. (at [23]) 
        
       
      
    105 Having regard to all of those considerations, it seems to me that there was a material error in not referring to the Fernando principles and not acknowledging as at least one relevant consideration the aboriginality of the applicants and the social and economic difficulties flowing from that fact. Accordingly, I would favour a re-sentencing of the applicants by this court. 
     
      
    106 In addition, it is said that the sentencing judge should have taken account of the opinions of the victim tendered before him. We are in an environment in the criminal justice system where increasing attention is given to views of the victim in relation to sentence, but of course not as to guilt or innocence and normally contending for a harsh sentence. If weight is to be given to the views of victims as to the penalty and its severity are to be regarded as relevant, it seems to me by parity of reasoning that some weight, (perhaps marginal) should be given to the view of the victim who urges leniency. In R v Bradford (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 6 May 1988) Street CJ said that: 
     
      
       
        
        …it does not of course lie in the hands of the victim to determine what punishment should meted out for a criminal offence. Punishment can properly be tempered in the light of the victim’s attitude. But the community’s interest in ensuring law abiding conduct by its citizens must be given due weight when determining the sentence in a case such as this. 
        
       
       
      These remarks were made in a context where a victim had returned to live with an offender who had committed violent acts upon her. As was said in  
      R v Peter James Glen 
       (1994) NSWCCA 19 December 1994 (unreported) by Grove J in response to a submission that the trial judge had fallen into error in failing to give adequate weight to, inter alia, the attitude of the complainant in a case involving an allegation of sexual intercourse without consent: 
       
       
        
        It cannot be that the attitude of complainants can govern the duty of the court when proceeding to sentence. As has been pointed out elsewhere, the adoption of such a practice or philosophy would involve taking into account the desires of unforgiving complainants for vengeance or salutary penalty. 
        
       
       
      However, in the circumstances of that case, Grove J said that this matter had not been overlooked by the sentencing judge. On the other hand, Simpson J held that evidence of forgiveness might have only “minor relevance” when compared to the importance of general deterrence. Loveday AJ agreed with the judgment of Grove J. Nothing in that case, it seems to me, determined that the charitable views of the victim should be ignored altogether in sentencing, that is, to be regarded as totally irrelevant 
       
      
    107 If this court were to re-sentence, it seems to be not in contest that Ms Simpson has done well in prison, has been studying music and attempting a variety of courses within Berrima Correctional Centre. The prison chaplain has expressed a sympathetic view, adverting to a prior violent relationship in her de facto marriage, and expressing the opinion that a course conducted by the Salvation Army in relation to the applicant has been: 
     
      
       
        
        highly successful in providing cognitive behavioural approaches to therapy and thus providing alternatives to substance abuse. 
        
       
       
       Ms Simpson’s educational progress in prison is extremely impressive. She has completed courses in employability skills, art, occupational health and safety, vocational educational and training, living skills and the senior correctional education officer at the Berrima campus (Mr Beszant) has said: 
       
       
        
        Kaylene has always expressed a keen interest in learning more about her indigenous culture and to further this she has been enrolled in the HSC subject “Aboriginal Studies”. This year she is doing the year 11 preliminary year through Karabara Distance Education Centre by correspondence. She has submitted 3 assignments and is currently 2 weeks ahead of schedule. It is her intention to complete year 11 in 2004 and commence year 12 in 2005. 
        
       
      
    108 Having regard to all of these matters I would: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) grant leave to appeal in each case; 
         
        (b) uphold the appeals; 
        
        
        (c) order that the sentences be adjusted so that the applicant, Mr Newman be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and that the applicant Ms Simpson be sentenced to imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.

     Regina v Mario Joseph Merlino 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted by a jury after a trial before his Honour Judge Robison at the District Court at Penrith, in respect of counts that: 
     
      
       
        
        1. On 13 October 2001, at Eastern Creek, in the State of New South Wales, being then armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, [he] did rob Stephen Galea, of a sum of cash, one mobile phone, a set of keys and motor vehicle, namely a Hyundai Excel sedan, the property of Stephen Galea; and that 
        
       
       
        
        2. On or about 14 October 2001, at Eastern Creek, in the State of New South Wales, being then armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, [he] did rob Craig Dayball, of one motor vehicle, namely a Nissan pulsar sedan, one wallet containing a sum of money and personal papers, a mobile phone and phone charger, a set of golf clubs, one halogen light, one briefcase, a number of compact discs and a set of keys, the property of Craig Dayball. 
        
       
      
    2 The appellant was sentenced on 24 April 2003 to an effective head sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five years. He appeals against the convictions, but not against the sentence.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 The victim of the first offence, Mr Galea, gave evidence that he was robbed at knifepoint of the property in question after he stopped at a red light, at about 7:45 PM on 13 October 2001, at the intersection of Wallgrove Road and the Great Western Highway, Eastern Creek. A male entered the car through the passenger side while he was waiting for the lights to change. That male was described by him as “an unshaven scruffy looking male with black facial hair, aboriginal, in his mid twenties about 5 feet six tall, with short straight black hair wearing a T-shirt”, with skin that was dark in colour, “darker than a tan”. In the split second in which he had to observe the knife, Mr Galea said that it looked “basically like a kitchen knife, a steak knife with a sharp point on it” and with a bit of a serrated edge. The male drove Mr Galeas’ car away in an easterly direction on the Great Western Highway.  
     
      
    4 The victim of the second offence, Mr Dayball, gave evidence that he was also robbed at knifepoint of his property between about 11:45 pm and midnight on the same night. This offence occurred after he had stopped at the same red traffic signal, at the intersection of Wallgrove Road and Great Western Highway, at Eastern Creek.  
     
      
    5 The male who entered the car through the passenger side was similarly described by Mr Dayball as “an unshaven dark skinned male, about 30 years old, of aboriginal appearance with shaved brown black hair, of slim build and about 170 centimetres tall.” In response to a request from the male, who said that he had a problem with his vehicle, Mr Dayball gave him a lift, collecting on the way his female friend who was standing on the side of the road.  
     
      
    6 The male told Mr Dayball that his car was parked about 100 metres before Wallgrove road and asked that he take them there. Mr Dayball was then directed into a poorly lit narrow street (Pikes Lane). 
     
      
    7 Another vehicle, which was described by Mr Dayball as a small white car, either a Hyundai Excel or a Daewoo Lanos, approached them at high speed from behind. Mr Dayball stopped his vehicle and the white vehicle stopped about 1 metre behind them.  
     
      
    8 Both the male and his female friend exited Mr Dayball’s vehicle. The male walked around the vehicle onto the driver’s side, where he stood alongside Mr Dayball. He was holding a 25-30 centimetres long knife with a wooden handle, which had a long blade of about 15 centimetres. 
     
      
    9 He then robbed Mr Dayball of his wallet containing cash and other papers, as well as his mobile phone and phone charger. The male placed all of the items that he had taken into the white vehicle. Mr Dayball saw the female get into the passenger seat of that vehicle. The male then took Mr Dayball’s vehicle leaving him on the street. Both vehicles reversed and drove off back down the street towards the Great Western Highway. 
     
      
    10 Mr Galea’s white Hyundai sedan was recovered by police in the early hours of the morning at Orcan Lane. The appellant’s fingerprints were not found in the vehicle.  
     
      
    11 At about 3:50 AM on 14 October 2001 Police saw Mr Dayball’s Nissan sedan being driven through the bowser section of the Quix Service Station on Popondetta Road at Emerton. The vehicle was followed until it came to a stop at a red light signal at the corner of Popondetta Road and Luxford Road, Emerton. Police arrested the appellant who was driving the car and the female passenger, Levana Miles, who was the appellant’s fiancée. There was another female in the rear passenger seat, Sandra Deigan. She was not charged and police were unable to find her at the time of the trial.  
     
      
    12 The bumbag of Ms Miles was searched and found to contain the mobile phone and charger which belonged to Mr Dayball. A search of the vehicle revealed a knife (which was not fingerprinted) in the driver’s door compartment, the set of keys which belonged to Mr Galea on the floor of the passenger side footwell, and the wallet of Mr Dayball on the back passenger seat, as well as some syringes.  
     
      
    13 The appellant refused to participate in a line up. He informed police, when interviewed, that he and Ms Miles were in the Nissan for the purpose of taking her to a hospital. It was his account that the owner of the Nissan had mistaken her for a prostitute and had tried to “help himself to a free root”. The appellant was photographed after he was charged, but otherwise he exercised his right to silence.  
     
      
    14 The issue in relation to each offence, as was made abundantly clear in the addresses, and in the summing up, was whether the Crown had proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was the appellant who had committed the two robberies.  
     
      
    15 Although, as a result of the preliminary ruling by the trial judge, the case was not conducted as one involving coincidence evidence, clearly there was an overlap in the evidence in relation to opportunity, and in relation to the possession of potentially incriminatory objects.  
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    16 In relation to the first count, the Crown identified a number of circumstances that were relied upon in order to prove that it was the appellant who had robbed Mr Galea of his car and property. They comprised the facts that:  
     
      
       
      (a) the appellant, as was evident from the photo taken shortly after his arrest, was of an appearance that was consistent with the description given by Mr Galea, and was wearing a T shirt; 
       
       
      (b) the appellant was arrested at 3:50 AM in the Emerton area in Mr Dayball’s Nissan sedan, in which Mr Galea’s keys were found; 
       
       
      (c) a knife was found in the door compartment of Mr Dayball’s vehicle next to where the appellant was seated when he was arrested; 
       
       
      (d) Mr Galea’s vehicle matched the description of the small white vehicle, which Mr Dayball said had come up behind him, in Pikes Lane, when he was robbed.  
       
      
    17 In relation to the second count the Crown identified for the jury the several circumstances relied upon. They included the facts that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the appellant, as was evident from the post arrest photograph, was consistent in appearance with the description of the robber that was given by Mr Dayball to Police; 
       
       
      (b) the appellant was arrested in possession of Mr Dayball’s Nissan some four hours after its theft; 
       
       
      (c) a knife was found in the door compartment of the vehicle in the compartment adjacent to the appellant.  
       
       
      The Defence Case 
       
      
    18 At the trial, the appellant gave evidence that he had been at his mother’s home at South Penrith, with his fiancée Ms Miles, at the time of the first offence. He said that he and Ms Miles left there at about 8 o’clock, and that he dropped her off at the home of Sandra Deigan, which was not far from the intersection of Wallgrove Road and the Great Western Highway. He then drove to Peter Vatrano’s house at Willmot, arriving there at about 10 PM. He said that he stayed at these premises until around 2 AM, on 14 October.  
     
      
    19 He said that a male person had called Mr Vatrano’s mobile phone at 1:30 to 1:45 AM and advised that his fiancée had been picked up on the highway, that she had been raped and that she had asked for him to pick her up. The appellant said that he informed the caller that he could not do so, because he had been drinking and was not prepared to drive.  
     
      
    20 He said that he had no idea of the caller’s identity, adding that he had not asked him his name, or what injuries his fiancée had suffered. He acknowledged that he had not asked the caller to contact the police, nor had he requested him to take her to a hospital. He also accepted that he has not asked to speak to Ms Miles, even though, he said, he could hear her crying in the background.  
     
      
    21 About 20 or 30 minutes later, he said, he received a call from his fiancée on the same mobile. According to him, she was upset and explained what had happened. He repeated that he could not drive because he had been drinking. She said that she had a car and would get closer to him. They arranged to meet at Willmot Shopping Centre. 
     
      
    22 The appellant then said that he left straight away to meet her and that she was at the Centre waiting when he arrived, 15 minutes or so later. When he asked her whose car it was, she said that it belonged to one of her regular clients from her work as a prostitute on the Great Western Highway, and that that vehicle had to be returned to him by the following morning, before he went to work.  
     
      
    23 He said that even though he knew that she had been raped and wanted to go to the hospital, they spent the next hour or so driving around in order to buy drugs. He said that in the course of doing so, they had picked up Sandra Deigan, and that the reason for driving past the general area of the hospital instead of going there, was to buy some iced drinks at a service station.  
     
      
    24 Mr Vatrano, who acknowledged that he had been a friend of the appellant for over 10 years, and who also agreed that he had consumed alcohol and amphetamines on the night in question, gave evidence that the appellant had phoned him at about 10 PM, and had arrived at his house in his own vehicle at about 10:30 PM. He said that the first phone call was made at about 2 AM and that a male had asked for the appellant, stating that his partner had been assaulted on the highway at Michinbury. He said that he had heard the appellant tell the man that he would be there shortly. The appellant stayed there for another 15 minutes or so, until a second call was received. He said that, on this occasion, he heard the appellant say “I’ll be there as quick as I can”. Upon his account the appellant left on foot, saying that he was going to meet the male person, and his fiancée, at the Wilmot Shopping Centre. When he woke up in the morning he said that the appellant’s motor vehicle was gone.  
     
      
    25 It was the Crown case that the jury would dismiss the alibi evidence as incapable of belief, pointing to the inconsistencies in the accounts which were given to the police and to the jury, and to the inherent incredibility of the version of events which was given at trial. As the Crown pointed out, that version would have involved: 
     
      
       
      (a) the appellant having ignored the initial request of his fiancée for help, even though she had been allegedly raped, and was audibly upset; 
       
       
      (b) a man who had used the services of a female, who he believed to have been working as a prostitute, on the Great Western Highway, having trusted her to drive away in his Nissan sedan, and having expected it to be returned to him on the following morning; and  
       
       
      (c) the appellant and his fiancée having deferred hospital treatment while they drove around in order to obtain drugs and refreshments.  
       
       
       
      Ground 1: The trial judge erred in respect of his directions on circumstantial evidence.  
       
       
      Ground 2: The prejudice which flowed from the trials in respect of counts one and two being run together resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    26 When addressing the jury the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now as I indicated to you at the outset, identification can be proven if you, as the judges of the facts, accept that the circumstances that I’m about to refer to add up to support the fact beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the person that robbed both Mr Galea and Mr Dayball. 
        
       
       
        
        If you  
        look at both cases separately 
        , but at the end of the day, that’s the issue in relation to both matters, ‘Was it the accused?’” 
        
       
       
      And, further: 
       
       
        
        “What the Crown says to you is, there’s a number of pieces – a bit like a jigsaw puzzle and when you put the pieces together the only rational inference you can draw from those – putting the pieces together is that it was the accused that in fact committed both of these offences.”  
        
       
       
      And finally: 
       
       
        
        “In conclusion, as I said to you, this is a circumstantial case. The Crown points to a number of circumstances to prove its case and the Crown says when you add up all those circumstances, you would be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this is the person that committed both offences. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown asks you to draw inferences in relation to those particular facts and I’ve already been through them once so I won’t go through them again. What the Crown says is, that the only rational, and once again operative word ‘rational’, the only rational hypotheses is that it is the accused that in fact did  
        both robberies 
        . I’ve indicated to you what the Crown relies upon for  
        counts one and counts two about the circumstances 
         so I won’t go over it again for you.” 
        
       
      
    27 When dealing with circumstantial proof, his Honour instructed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I said, the Crown relies on what is called circumstantial evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A case based on circumstantial evidence may be just as convincing and reliable as a case based on direct evidence depending on the nature of the circumstances relied upon when considered as a whole and I emphasise that, ‘when considered as a whole’ because the Crown relies on an accumulation of facts. The Crown does not have to prove every single fact beyond a reasonable doubt but the Crown relies upon the total – totality of those facts and asks you to draw certain conclusions and inferences.” 
        
       
      
    28 Two particular complaints were addressed, pursuant to these grounds.  
     
      
    29 First, it was submitted that the jury were impermissibly invited to have regard to the facts in support of both counts in determining the guilt of the accused in relation to the individual counts. That was said to arise from the prosecution, in the passages cited, encouraging the jury to take a global approach to the evidence, rather than an approach that focussed upon the evidence that was properly admissible, in relation to each count considered separately. The risk of impermissible reasoning being applied, it was submitted, was then compounded by an absence of any specific direction from the trial judge that there were two separate trials being conducted, or of any direction that the evidence, in respect of the first count, was inadmissible in relation to the second count, and vice versa.  
     
      
    30 In a supplementary submission, complaint was made that a specific warning should have been given to the jury against propensity and probability reasoning.  
     
      
    31 Upon a fair reading of the whole of his address, however, it is clear that the Crown Prosecutor did not assert that there was a single circumstantial case; nor did he seek to rely on tendency or probability reasoning. On the contrary, he went through each count separately, indicating separately the evidence that was available in relation to it.  
     
      
    32 Clearly there was an overlap in the evidence particularly in relation to the finding of the keys, of the first victim, in the vehicle which was being driven by the appellant, at the time of his arrest.  
     
      
    33 In the event of the jury being satisfied that the appellant had stolen the Nissan, then that circumstance could also have properly been taken into account, without resort to coincidence or tendency reasoning, to place him in the general area where the Hyundai offence was committed. 
     
      
    34 The trial judge summed up the case in a way which, clearly and consistently, dealt separately with the two counts, and with an alternative count of stealing a motor vehicle, which was preferred as a back up charge to the second count.  
     
      
    35 In the course of doing so, he separated the strands of circumstantial evidence that were relevant for each count, and nothing was said by him that might have excited probability or tendency reasoning. To have gone any further would, in my view, have risked attracting the very problem of which McHugh J spoke in KRM v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 221 at 234: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, although the evidence on one count may show a propensity to commit crime - even crime of the kind the subject of the other charges - the experience of the judiciary is that ordinarily juries do not use propensity reasoning to convict on other counts unless instructed that they can do so. To give the warning when it is not needed may divert the jury from its proper task. The more directions and warnings juries are given the more likely it is that they will forget or misinterpret some directions or warnings. Further, to require that a propensity warning always be given may sometimes be prejudicial to an accused person because it might distract a jury from doing what the trial judge told them to do here, to focus upon the evidence relevant to each charge. It may even suggest the very train of reasoning that a propensity warning is designed to overcome and make it difficult for the jurors, try as they might, to remain uninfluenced by the forbidden chain of reasoning.” 
        
       
      
    36 It is true that his Honour continued, in that case: 
     
      
       
        
        “In some cases of multiple counts, however, some feature of the evidence may create a risk that the jury will use that particular evidence or a conviction in respect of a count to reason that the accused is the kind of person who would commit the crime charged in another count or counts in the presentment. If that risk exists, the judge is bound to direct the jury that they cannot use that evidence or conviction to convict the accused on the other count or counts unless, of course, the evidence is admissible in respect of that count or counts. An example of such a risk is the accused being charged on the one presentment with offences against different victims and the evidence in respect of one or more counts being inadmissible in respect of the other counts. Ordinarily, however, the court should order separate trials where there are different victims, where the evidence in respect of one victim is not relevant to the charge in respect of the other victims and where the joinder of charges creates a risk of prejudice. But in some cases, an application for the trial of separate counts may be refused on the ground that the convenience of trying the charges together far outweighs any risk of prejudice or, more usually, because a separate trial is not sought. If that occurs, a propensity warning will almost certainly be required.” 
        
       
      
    37 There was, in the present case, no application for a separate trial in relation to the two counts, and the defendant concedes that it was appropriate that they be tried together. More relevant for present purposes, however, is the fact that the case was one where some of the evidence that was admissible in relation to the second count, for example, the arrival of the white vehicle in Pikes Lane, the finding of Mr Galea’s keys in the Nissan, and the arrest of the appellant while driving the vehicle, was clearly admissible in relation to the first count. In those circumstances a KRM warning would have been potentially confusing, and less helpful than a summing up which specifically identified the individual strands of evidence that were admissible in relation to each count.  
     
      
    38 In my view, the summing up achieved the objective of which McHugh J spoke. The absence of any request by trial counsel, for a propensity or probability (coincidence) warning, or for a KRM warning, indicates that no inadequacy was seen in the directions, in the atmosphere of the trial.  
     
      
    39 The case is one to which the principles discussed in Regina v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174 apply, and I would refuse leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  
     
      
    40 Next, it was submitted that the directions of the trial judge did not adequately deal with the onus that applies in relation to the proof of indispensable intermediate facts in a circumstantial case, most particularly in relation to the appellant’s possession of the Hyundai keys. 
     
      
    41 In this regard reliance was placed upon the observations of Dawson J in Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 576 at 585, when his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “if it is necessary for the jury to reach a conclusion of fact as an indispensable intermediate step in the reasoning process towards an inference of guilt, then that conclusion must be established beyond a reasonable doubt”. 
        
       
      
    42 Additionally, reference was made to the joint judgment of this Court in Regina v Merritt [1999] NSWCCA 29 at 71 to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the relatively few incriminating facts in this case, we think that it was both desirable and necessary that his Honour should have identified for the jury the crucial factual issues and assisted them to apply to them the legal rule requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt of the Crown case and, in particular, directed them that if they regarded any particular fact as being an indispensable link in the chain of proof, then that fact must be proved to their satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict. We do not think that this was a case of such simplicity as to enable a general direction concerning the onus and standard of proof to suffice.” 
        
       
      
    43 The observations of Dawson J in Shepherd do need to be read in their full context, his Honour having said (at 585): 
     
      
       
        
        “The judgments in Chamberlain do not support the proposition that, in a case resting upon circumstantial evidence, the jury may only properly draw an inference of guilt upon facts - individual items of evidence - proved beyond reasonable doubt. Still less does the case establish that a direction in those terms should be given to a jury. Of course, it is recognized in  
        Chamberlain 
         that, if it is necessary for the jury to reach a conclusion of fact as an indispensable, intermediate step in the reasoning process towards an inference of guilt, then that conclusion must be established beyond reasonable doubt. But to say as much is to do little more than state a truism. It does not mean that each item of evidence taken into account in reaching that conclusion must, considered separately, be established beyond reasonable doubt.  
        
       
       
        
        Whether it is desirable for a trial judge to identify an intermediate conclusion of fact in his charge to the jury in order to instruct them that it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt will depend upon the particular case. Such an instruction will only be possible where the conclusion is a necessary link in a chain of reasoning. Even then, particularly when that is obvious, the instruction may not be helpful.” 
        
       
      
    44 Reference may also be made the judgment of Mason CJ and McHugh J in Shepherd. Mason CJ said, at 575: 
     
      
       
        
        “I agree with Dawson J. and McHugh J. that  
        Chamberlain v. The Queen (No. 2) 
         is not authority for the proposition that, in cases based on circumstantial evidence, juries must be directed that they cannot use a fact as a basis for inferring guilt unless that fact is proved beyond reasonable doubt. I am also in general agreement with the reasons given by Dawson J. for the conclusion that the giving of such a direction is not required either as a matter of law or in order to ensure conformity with the general standard of proof in criminal cases.”  
         
        
       
      
    45 McHugh J similarly observed, at 592-593: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ordinarily, in a circumstantial evidence case, guilt is inferred from a number of circumstances - often numerous - which taken as a whole eliminate the hypothesis of innocence. The cogency of the inference of guilt is derived from the cumulative weight of circumstances, not the quality of proof of each circumstance.  
        
       
       
        
        In a particular case, an inference of guilt beyond reasonable doubt may not be able to be drawn unless each fact relied on to found the inference is established beyond reasonable doubt. This is likely to be the case where the incriminating facts relied on to establish the inference are few in number. But the more facts that are relied on to found the inference of guilt, the less likely it is that each or any fact will have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, even when guilt beyond reasonable doubt cannot be inferred unless certain facts are proved, it may still be open to infer guilt beyond reasonable doubt even though each fact is not proved to that standard.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Although I think that the majority in  
        Chamberlain 
         intended to assert that an inference of guilt can never be drawn unless each circumstance relied on to found that inference is proved beyond reasonable doubt, it does not follow that  
        Chamberlain 
         is an authority for the proposition that a jury must be directed to that effect. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Chamberlain 
         was concerned with whether the verdict of the jury was unsafe or unsatisfactory. It was not concerned with the directions which a jury should receive on the standard of proof to be applied to the circumstances of the case.”  
         
        
       
      
    46 I am not persuaded that the finding of the keys in the Nissan, and proof that they were in the possession of the appellant was an indispensable intermediate step in the proof of the appellant’s guilt, concerning the first count. This was not a link in the chain case, of the kind considered in Regina v Zaiter [2004] NSWCCA 35, nor was it a case where there was a paucity of evidence of the kind seen in Regina v Merritt. 
     
      
    47 In any event, the direction, which it is now submitted should have been given in relation the keys, to the effect that the jury should have been satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that “the appellant had possession of the keys to the vehicle belonging to the first victim, and … that [he] had possession of the keys as a consequence of having committed the first robbery”, would have not only been circular, but also confusing. It would have involved the jury being satisfied, as an intermediate fact, that the appellant had obtained the keys as a result of stealing the Hyundai, whereas the theft by him of that vehicle was the ultimate fact that was to be proved from the relevant circumstances, one of which was the possession by the appellant of the keys. 
     
      
    48 There was also no complaint by trial counsel concerning the directions in relation to circumstantial proof, or in relation to the possession of the items found in the Nissan. Leave is required under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Since I am unpersuaded that any miscarriage of justice arose, I would refuse leave.  
     
      
       
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in submitting the photograph of the appellant taken upon his arrest. 
       
      
    49 This ground was not pressed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The evidence given by the appellant that he had been in jail since the commission of the offence and that his alibi witness was also in jail caused the trial to miscarry.  
       
      
    50 This ground arose out of the circumstance that, in the course of the cross-examination of the appellant concerning his alibi, the following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “Crown: And no doubt when you were interviewed by the police you knew in the back of your own mind that you were with Peter Vatrano the night before? 
         
        Accused: yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now when did you first go back and see Peter Vatrano about being an alibi for you? 
         
        A. I never went back and saw him I was in custody from the very night onwards. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now just in relation to Peter Vatrano so you had not contact with him for quite some time, is that right? 
         
        A. Yeah almost a year. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then you had a conversation with him about him being your alibi, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes - - I didn’t’ actually ask him to be my alibi, he asked me – I was actually in prison at the time on the, being held for this on remand, he came into prison also on remand for something else and he asked me why was I in prison and I explained that it was due to these events, and he said ‘but you were with me at that time’ and I said ‘Yes I was’. And he said ‘Well if you need me to come to court and say what happened, tell’, like you know what I mean, to tell the truth about what happened, ‘I would be prepared to do that.’” 
        
       
       
      And later: 
       
       
        
        “Q. And yet you didn't approach him at all for something like a year later? 
         
        A. I wasn’t able to approach him, I was in custody.” 
        
       
       
      
    51 No application was made by trial counsel for a discharge of the jury, nor was any direction sought, or given, in relation to the disclosure that each of the appellant and Mr Vatreno had been detained in custody.  
     
      
    52 It is now submitted that the evidence of that fact was so highly prejudicial that no direction to the jury would have been capable of disposing of the resulting prejudice and that the jury should have been discharged. Alternatively, if the trial was to continue then, it is submitted, the trial judge should have ruled that the evidence concerning the two men being in custody at the time of their conversation was irrelevant and instructed the jury to disregard it.  
     
      
    53 I am quite unpersuaded that the evidence was materially prejudicial, or that any risk of a miscarriage of justice arose. It was made clear that the appellant was being held on remand in relation to these charges, and that he was not serving a sentence for any other offence. Similarly the appellant made it clear that at the time of the conversation, the custody of the witness Vatrano arose because he was also on remand waiting trial.  
     
      
    54 The jury would hardly have found it surprising that the appellant was detained, pending trial, given the seriousness of the charges. There is, in my view, no sensible basis for supposing that they took that into account as a matter that was unfavourable to his case. Moreover, any direction that was given in relation to these answers, which were volunteered by the appellant, risked bringing greater attention to them, and possibly attracting a significance which they did not otherwise have.  
     
      
    55 The Crown Prosecutor did place the alibi evidence in issue, having regard to its inherent implausibility. He was entitled to explore, both with the appellant and with the witness Vatrano, the circumstances in which, and the time at which, they first discussed this aspect of the case, so as to test their memory. 
     
      
    56 There was no attempt by the Crown to use the circumstance of the detention, either of the appellant, or of the witness, as a matter which of itself, went to their credibility. Had that occurred, then consideration would properly have needed to be given to s 103 of the Evidence Act, and to a direction concerning its possible use. There was no objection to the evidence, nor any request that it be struck out, or that it be limited in some way, for example as a matter not going to character or credibility.  
     
      
    57 I would refuse leave under Rule 4 to argue this ground.  
     
      
       
      Additional Ground 5 – A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by conduct of the Crown in: 
       
      a) cross-examining the appellant in a manner which infringed the appellant’s right to silence; 
       
      b) cross-examining the appellant in a manner which suggested the appellant bore an onus to investigate evidence to prove his innocence in a timely fashion; 
       
      c) addressing the jury to the effect that an adverse inference should be drawn against the appellant as a result of the evidence adduced as a result of the cross-examination referred to in (a) and (b), above.  
       
      
    58 Leave was sought to rely upon this ground as an additional ground of appeal. It arises out of two aspects of the cross-examination of the appellant as follows.  
     
      
    59 The first segment relates to the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You see when you were arrested by the police in the early hours, about 3:50 am on the fourteenth. Remember you were arrested on the corner -  
         
        A. Yes I certainly do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: -- of Luxford Road and – well Luxford Road and Popondetta Road? 
         
        A. Yeah, that’s not an incident I would forget very quickly.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. And of course you no doubt would have wanted to tell the police that you’re taking Lee to hospital, she’d just been raped? 
        
       
       
        
        OBJECTION. QUESTION PRESSED.” 
        
       
      
    60 After the luncheon break, and after having had an opportunity to consider the question, the objection was withdrawn by defence counsel without his Honour being asked to rule upon it, and the cross-examination then proceeded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Sir, before lunch I was asking you questions about your intention to take legal (sic) Lee or Levana to the hospital. Do you recall those questions? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And of course that was no doubt in the forefront of your mind to take her to hospital at some stage? 
         
        A. Yes, it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And of course when you were stopped by the police at about 3:50 am on the Sunday morning it was still in the forefront of your mind wasn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. To take her to hospital? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is there any reason why you did not tell the police there and then that you wanted to take her to the hospital because she’d been raped? 
         
        A. We were never really given any opportunity to [say] anything to them until we actually got the police station. We were pulled out of the car, thrown onto the ground on our stomachs handcuffed behind our backs, pulled up by two officers at a time and thrown into the back of paddy wagons. I was in total shock so nothing crossed my mind except what the heck was going on. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because as far as you were concerned you were a person aiding a victim of a rape case weren’t you? 
         
        A. Yes, yeah 
        
       
       
        
        Q. This is when you’re stopped by the police? 
         
        A: yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you wanted to get her to hospital to receive treatment? 
         
        A. Yeah, basically, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you didn’t tell the police about that? 
         
        A. No, no.”  
        
       
      
    61 The second aspect of the cross-examination of the appellant to which this ground relates was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Sir just ask you (sic) some questions in relation to your friend Peter Vatrano. When did you first have a conversation with him about being your alibi in this trial? 
         
        A. When did I first have a conversation with him? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did you first speak to him about the fact that you needed him to be an alibi in this trial? 
         
        A. I never actually asked him to be an alibi in my case at all? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why not? 
         
        A. Because I never did. I wasn’t prepared to call anybody into court unnecessarily. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well you understand don’t you from the time that you were charged, because you were interviewed by the police about this? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That the police were investigating allegations of two robberies? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The first occurred at about 7:45 pm? 
         
        A. Yes, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the second one occurred at about 11.45 or thereafter pm on 13 October weren’t you, you were aware of that? 
         
        A. Yes, yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. And no doubt when you were interviewed by the police you knew in the back of your mind that you were with Peter Vatrano the night before? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now when did you first go back and see Peter Vatrano about being an alibi for you?… 
         
        A. I never went back and saw him. I was in custody from that very night.” 
        
       
      
    62 Thereafter followed the evidence which gave rise to Ground 4, and which I have earlier set out, to the effect that a year later Mr Vatrano spoke to the appellant, about the relevant night, while they were both in custody.  
     
      
    63 In the cross-examination of Mr Vatrano it was established that, so far as he could recall, he had last spoken to the appellant in October 2001. Somewhat inconsistently with that evidence, he also said, at one point, that he had spoken to the appellant about the alibi “about a year later”, although at another point he said that he could not recall when that had occurred.  
     
      
    64 The first segment of the Crown address in respect of which complaint is made, arising from this cross-examination was to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now remember this, the whole time he says ‘I wanted to take her to hospital, she had been raped’. ‘She’s been raped’. She’d been assaulted on the highway. In other words he was the good Samaritan, if you accept his version, about taking her to hospital because she’d been raped. He was concerned about her but yet he doesn’t say anything at all about ‘Look, what are you doing? I’m just trying to take her to the hospital, she’s been raped’. Nothing at all said. We then come to the interview. Once again nothing at all said about the rape.  
        
       
       
        
        The Crown would say, that that version just cannot be accepted…” 
        
       
      
    65 The second segment of the address, of which complaint is made, was to the following effect:  
     
      
       
        
        “I’ll then come to now the evidence of Mr Peter Vatrano, the alibi. I’ll call him the alibi. When the accused was interviewed by the police he well knew what the allegations were and you can see the tape. The police said, ‘We are investigating a matter that occurred firstly at 7.45’ and that’s at – well firstly they interview him about the second robbery first. They interview him about main enquiries and concerning a robbery that occurred on the Great Western Highway at Minchinbury about 11.00, 11.45 pm on Saturday, 13 October. He is on notice right from the word go that the police are investigating a matter at about that time.  
        
       
       
        
        So when he’s being interviewed, he would’ve had –  
        even if he didn’t say anything which is his right 
        , he would have known his own mind. ‘Gee the police are alleging I’ve done a robbery at about 1:45’. He’d say ‘Well I know where I was last night at 11.45. I was at Peter’s place’. Well what does he do? There’s no discussion with Peter for 12 months, for 12 months and then its only when Peter fronts him. 
        
       
       
        
        In other words, this man had the perfect alibi, if you accept his version from the very, very first day and does nothing about raising it with Peter Vatrano. He waits for Peter Vatrano to come to him. Do you think that seems the appropriate action of a person that’s been charged with a very serious matter.” 
        
       
       
      
    66 It was submitted that there were three distinct, and impermissible, lines of cross-examination involved in those exchanges in so far as their purpose or effect was to: 
     
      
       
      (a) invite an inference of guilt adverse to the appellant arising from his failure to give an explanation to police, at the time of his arrest, that was consistent with his evidence at trial; 
       
      (b) invite an inference adverse to his credibility as a result of his failure to tell police of an alibi consistent with that adduced at trial; 
       
      (c) suggest that there was an onus upon the appellant to act quickly to investigate his alibi. 
       
      
    67 The submissions which were advanced in this respect need to be understood in the light of the fact that when the appellant was interviewed by police at Mount Druitt Police Station, some hours after his arrest, he did put forward the explanation for his presence in the Nissan previously mentioned as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you tell me what the circumstances are of you being in that car? 
         
        A. Ah, no. I don't want to actually say anything um, in the interview until I've spoken to the solicitor um, all that I'll say about it ah, the interview at all, is that ah, we were in that car because um, I was taking, or ah, under the um, intention of taking my wife to a hospital um, because um, the owner of that particular car mistook ah, my fiancé for a ah, a prostitute on the highway. And ah, decided to um, help himself to a, a free root, and decided to try and rape my soon to be wife. And ah, all I can say is ah, the putrid little fuck is lucky he’s not fuckin’ dead. And that’s all I’ve got to fuckin’ say.” 
        
       
      
    68 In my view, the first aspect of this further submission does not reflect the use to which the relevant cross-examination was properly put. As I understand the Crown case, it was available to show the inherent incredibility of the alibi evidence insofar as it was incomprehensible that a person who was engaged in transporting a fiancée, who he believed had been raped, to hospital for medical treatment, in a car which had been borrowed from one of her regular clients, would not have disclosed those circumstances immediately to police when stopped by them, and then sought their assistance.69 This is not the case of the kind seen, for example, in Petty v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 95 or Regina v Anderson [2002] NSWCCA 141, where the Prosecution sought, inappropriately, to rely upon the silence of the accused when interviewed by police, or at committal, in order to support an inference that a defence or explanation which emerged for the first time, at trial, was a new invention or was suspect.70 On the contrary, the present is a case where silence of the accused at the point of arrest was inconsistent with him having been on a genuine mission, in a borrowed motor vehicle, to secure help.71 Moreover it was not a case where the Crown sought to draw an adverse inference from the fact of initial silence, followed by the presentation at trial of an explanation or defence. An explanation was given during the police interview, which occurred within a few hours of arrest, which was not wholly consistent with the applicant’s evidence at trial.72 In those circumstances, the case does not fall within the Petty principle, and there was nothing unfair or erroneous in the cross-examination, or in the way that this aspect of the case was left to the jury.  
     
      
    73 I am similarly unpersuaded that the cross-examination, or submissions of the Crown, in relation to the alibi, infringed the appellant’s right to silence. 74 The alibi directions that were given were impeccable, and dealt specifically, and appropriately, with the onus of proof. Additionally His Honour and the Crown Prosecutor in the passage cited, each made it clear to the jury that the appellant was entitled to exercise his right to not answer any further questions that were put to him by police during the interview.75 It was next submitted that the directions given were inadequate and that error occurred, so far as the jury were not cautioned when the evidence was called or during the summing up, that the exercise by an accused of the right to silence must not lead to any conclusion of guilt, in the terms held to be appropriate in R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109. In fact a specific and adequate direction was given by his Honour during the evidence of Detective Sergeant McGee, at the time that the ERISP was tendered. 76 I also do not consider that the cross-examination or the address of the Crown prosecutor conveyed a suggestion that the appellant had an onus to act quickly to investigate his alibi. Neither the Crown nor the trial judge said anything to expressly raise that as a possibility, and for the jury to have drawn any such inference would have involved a remarkable leap in reasoning. 77 As I have observed there was no objection to any portion of the cross-examination, other than the one objection that was withdrawn; nor was any additional direction sought in relation to the way in which the Crown address or the trial judge summed up.78 The appellant also requires leave to raise this further ground. The case is not one where any evidence has been placed before us to suggest, on the one hand, that there was incompetence on the part of trial counsel, or on the other hand, that the absence of any objection, or request for some additional direction, was attributable to a tactical decision. It is also a case where his Honour expressly invited counsel, at the close of the addresses, and again at the end of the summing up, to identify any particular direction which they sought. None was sought and no complaint was made in relation to any aspect of the summing up, let alone that sought to be advanced in support of this ground. 79 The Crown case was a strong case, and none of the perceived deficiencies was such, on my assessment, as to give rise to any miscarriage of justice. As with the other grounds, I would refuse leave under Rule 4.80 Accordingly I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Dunford J. 
     
      
    3 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence of 13 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months imposed on the respondent by Shaw J following his plea of guilty to the murder of Jai Jago on 26 April 2001 at Hurlstone Park. The sentence was imposed on 31 October 2003, and the Notice of Appeal was signed on behalf of the Director and served on the applicant that same day. 
     
      
    4 His co-accused, Kadr Diab pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter, which plea was accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment against him and was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years, taking into account other matters on a Form 1. 
     
      
    5 Late on the evening of Anzac Day 2001, the deceased Jai Jago, aged 18 years and his friend, Andrew Clayton also aged 18 years, left Grumpy’s Hotel in New Canterbury Road intending to walk to the Jago home nearby. They had spent most of the day socialising at various locations and were both affected by alcohol. They entered the 7-11 Store in New Canterbury Road where the deceased was described as being “drunk and obnoxious”. As they continued walking along the street, the deceased was waving his arms about and yelling at cars. They turned right into Old Canterbury Road and whilst walking past a chemist shop, the deceased kicked an unoccupied parked car causing some minor damage.  
     
      
    6 Shortly after this, a motor vehicle driven by Kadr Diab in which the respondent was a passenger, turned into Old Canterbury Road, travelling away from the city on the other side of the road. As it passed the deceased and his companion, it drew to a halt and reverse parked. The respondent and Diab got out of the car and approached the other two whereupon a heated discussion took place, particularly between the respondent and the deceased.  
     
      
    7 Ultimately, the deceased swung a punch at the respondent but apparently missed, although he may have struck Diab. The respondent then took a gun from his pocket, whereupon Clayton started to run away. The deceased also started to run then hesitated, and faced the respondent, whereupon the latter re-positioned himself and shot the deceased from a distance of about 2 metres. The deceased said words to the effect “What do you call that?” and then started to run away but soon collapsed, got up, took a couple of steps and then fell to the ground. The respondent and Diab then walked calmly back to the car and drove away.  
     
      
    8 A neighbour, who had witnessed the incident from his bedroom, rang 000 and the police and ambulance arrived on the scene within minutes. The deceased was unconscious and did not respond to treatment, he was taken to RPA Hospital and pronounced dead at 12:58am, the cause of death being a gunshot wound to the chest. His post-mortem blood alcohol reading was 0.171. The gun cartridge was found at the scene but the weapon was not located. It belonged to Diab but the respondent had been present when it had been purchased. 9 On 4 May, the respondent and his co-offender went for a holiday in Lebanon but returned on 17 June. In a conversation between an undercover police officer codenamed “Jennifer” and the respondent on 17 January 2002, which was covertly recorded on an authorised listening device, the respondent told “Jennifer” that he was the driver and he asked Diab to bring the gun from the car when he got out to challenge someone who had stuck up a finger at him in an offensive gesture, whereupon Diab handed him the gun. He said that the deceased threw a punch at him but missed and hit his mate, and he then shot the deceased. He also said that he aimed at the deceased’s head “…but you know it’s truly hard to hold the gun and shoot because you pull back”.  
     
      
    10 The respondent was arrested by police on 18 April and interviewed in the course of which he stated he was present but that his co-accused Diab had shot the deceased. He also said that he did not see the gun, was unaware that it was in the car and that when the deceased was shot, he was some distance away at the car.  
     
      
    11 A friend of the respondent, Zeynep Baykeyt and her brother, Yunus Baykeyt made statements to the police in relation to admissions made by the respondent. One admission was made after a television news broadcast about the incident, and on another occasion, he told Yunus Baykeyt that he had “shot a guy” at Hurlstone Park and then taken off and thrown the gun in the George’s River. 
     
      
    12 The respondent was born on 30 January 1984 and was 17 years and 3 months at the time of the offence and 19 years old when sentenced. He had no prior criminal convictions. In a report by Dr Christopher Lennings, Psychologist, he conceded that “the offence occurred for no particular reason” and that he had “stuffed up and must pay the consequences”. He told Dr Lennings that at the time of the incident, he was “scared” of the deceased and had purchased the pistol and secreted it under the passenger seat of the car, but was unable to explain why he had the pistol in the first place “other than he had purchased it to feel brave after being assaulted”.  
     
      
    13 A character reference from the President of the Northern Cyprus Turkish Association of NSW described the respondent’s background. He stated that the respondent’s parents were Turkish Cypriots and his mother and father separated when he was 11 years of age following arguments between them after his mother decided to pursue further studies, but the respondent remained close to both parents. 
     
      
    14 The respondent told Dr Lennings that he had no difficulties notwithstanding his parents’ separation until he went to High School where he had difficulty adjusting, began to truant and met a deviant peer group, although he denied criminality or significant substance abuse at that stage. 
     
      
    15 He left school after finishing Year 10 and obtaining his School Certificate. After leaving school, he worked for short periods as a butcher’s apprentice, in making garden hose sprinklers and in landscaping, but then drifted into unemployment and began hanging around with a significantly more delinquent group than previously and began drinking, using marijuana and gambling. 
     
      
    16 He also told Dr Lennings that over a year previously he had found a job as an apprentice carpenter and was in his second year, but a reference from his employer indicated he had only commenced 3 days prior to his arrest. Dr Lennings expressed the view (in July 2003, after the plea had been entered) that the respondent was mildly depressed, and appeared to express genuine guilt and remorse for his behaviour and was interested in acquiring vocational skills. 
     
      
    17 His Honour commenced his Remarks on Sentence by correctly observing that whilst all murder cases are disturbing in that they involve the loss of human life, this case was particularly so given that it involved a young victim, young offenders with no evidence of pre-meditation and that the acts were totally irrational. After dealing with the facts, his Honour referred specifically to the need for the courts to take a stand against the carrying of firearms and other weapons which have the potential to lead to fatal results, the need for deterrence and the community’s abhorrence of conduct of the kind involved in this offence, the respondent’s concessions to Dr Lennings that the offence occurred for no particular reason, that he must “pay the consequences” for it and could offer no excuse for his behaviour, Dr Lennings’ opinion that he appeared genuinely mortified that he had killed someone, and that he had thought about the victim’s family and the “sufferings they must feel”, but stressed the importance of rehabilitation particularly in the case of young offenders. 
     
      
    18 He found a number of mitigating factors including that the offence was not planned or organised, that the respondent had no prior criminal record and was otherwise of good character (somewhat remitted by the fact that he carried a loaded firearm in public), that he was unlikely to offend and had good prospects for rehabilitation, was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his age and had pleaded guilty. He allowed 25 percent discount on account of all aspects of the plea of guilty including the admission of wrongdoing, willingness to facilitate the course of justice, contrition and the utilitarian value of the plea, and found “special circumstances” by reason of the fact that the respondent had no prior convictions, it was his first time in custody, his age, his prospects of rehabilitation and his need for supervision on release in order to adjust to life in the community. 
     
      
    19 The Crown relied on seven specific grounds of appeal and it is convenient to deal with them in order. 
     
      
    GROUND 1: His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to deterrence, denunciation, punishment and community protection. 
     
      
    20 Under the heading “The principles applicable to the sentencing discretion”, his Honour referred to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the need to provide “adequate” punishment through recognition of the balancing required, on the one hand, to protect the community and denounce the offence, and on the other hand, to promote the rehabilitation of the offender and take into account the subjective circumstances so as to result in a sentence reflecting justice to both the community and the accused, and referred to Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. 21 After noting that the sentencing process should not be seen as merely punitive: R v Lattouf (CCA 12 December 1996 per Mahoney ACJ), his Honour dealt with the concept of rehabilitation as particularly applicable in the case of young offenders and concluded that whilst the sentence imposed must serve as a warning to others, this consideration cannot be imperative when it risks overriding the offender’s favourable subjective circumstances: at [37]. 
     
      
    22 Although his Honour made reference to the protection of the community, denunciation of the offence and deterrence, he also gave considerable prominence to the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation and the related subject of his youth. These latter factors were important relevant considerations but so were the other matters particularly those referred to in s 3A, including the need to ensure the offender is adequately punished for the offence, general and personal deterrence, the protection of the community, making the offender accountable for his actions, denunciation of the offender’s conduct and recognition of the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 
     
      
    23 Section 3A is in substance a codification and elaboration of the purposes of criminal punishment described in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 where the High Court recognised the troublesome but unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of those purposes which overlap, and it was pointed out that none of them can be considered in isolation when determining the appropriate sentence in a particular case.  
     
      
    24 This was a very serious offence involving the taking of another human life with no objective mitigating circumstances, and was a result of a young person carrying a gun for no good reason and in a loaded state, and deliberately picking a confrontation with the deceased and his companion. 
     
      
    25 His Honour made reference to the danger posed by the carrying of guns, but such conduct called for a sentence which gave sufficient weight to the elements of general and personal deterrence, denunciation of the conduct and punishment as well as rehabilitation.  
     
      
    26 At para [37] of his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour observed that, whilst the sentence imposed must serve as a warning to others, this consideration cannot be imperative where it risks overriding the offender’s favourable subjective circumstances, citing R v Jenkins [1999] NSWCCA 110 at [38]. If by that his Honour intended to convey that where there are favourable subjective circumstances such as youth and prospects of rehabilitation, those factors override or take precedence over deterrence, punishment and the protection of the community, his Honour was in error, and Jenkins is not, as I read it, authority for such a proposition. All the relevant objectives of punishment must be balanced against each other. In any event, his Honour went on in the next paragraph to observe that the subjective features were not all favourable in the light of the applicant’s familiarity with, and possession of firearms.  
     
      
    27 Deterrence, retribution and protection of the community are not to take precedence to the exclusion of rehabilitation, but neither is rehabilitation to take precedence over deterrence, retribution and punishment. All must be balanced in the overall synthesising of the sentence. 28 It is true that in the case of young offenders, there is generally greater emphasis given to rehabilitation and less to deterrence than in the case of adult offenders, but that depends in part on the age of the young person and the circumstances of the offence; and there comes a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a young offender, particularly if a crime of violence, is so great that the special attention normally given to rehabilitation in the case of young offenders must give way, and greater emphasis given to punishment and deterrence. The relevant principle was summarised in the joint judgment of this Court in R v AEM Snr and Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97]-[98] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well accepted that in the case of youth, general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation…. However, important as that principle is, it cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment nor, in circumstances where young offenders conduct themselves in a way which an adult does, can it stand in the way of the need to protect society.” 
        
       
       
      and their Honours quoted what had been said by Lee AJ in  
      R v Nichols 
       (1991) 57 A Crim R 391 at 395 as follows: 
       
       
        
        “However there is a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a man of 19, even though a young man, is of such a nature is so great, that the principle must, in the public interest, give way.” 
        
       
      
    29 See also R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135, R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[11], R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 469, R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37, 124 A Crim R 451 at [24], 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    30 Moreover, although the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 s 3 defines a “child” as any person under 18 years and accordingly the applicant stood to be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of that Act, he was 17 years and 3 months at the time of the offence and therefore hardly a “child” in the normal colloquial sense of the word. Growth from child to adult is a gradual process and for general sentencing purposes, there is no significant difference between a person shortly under 18 years and a person shortly over that age: R v Nguyen (CCA – 14 April 1994) per Blanch J. 
     
      
    31 Whilst appellate courts must be careful not to analyse a primary judge’s reasons too finely with a view to detecting any possible error or looseness of language, on reading the whole of the Remarks on Sentence in their context, and having regard to the sentence ultimately imposed, I am satisfied that his Honour gave a disproportionate weight to the respondent’s youth and his prospects of rehabilitation compared with deterrence, denunciation, punishment and protection of the community, and that ground 1 had been made good.GROUND 2: His Honour erred in stating the principles relevant to the determination of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    32 His Honour referred to the objective seriousness of the crime, the need for deterrence and to reflect the abhorrence of the community in relation to such conduct as appropriate to fixing the head sentence which he described as the punishment imposed by the Court for the offence: paras [46]-[47] but went on to refer to the non-parole period as involving a separate consideration of the offender’s subjective circumstances and as representing a date that the offender may work towards, so that if the promise of rehabilitation is shown to be well founded, he may be released at the expiration of that non-parole period: see [48]-[49].  
     
      
    33 In this context, his Honour referred to R v Simpson (2001) NSWCCA 534, 53 NSWLR 704, but the Court in Simpson followed what had been said by the High Court in Power v The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623 at 627-629 to the effect that the purpose of fixing the non-parole period is not to convert a punishment into an opportunity for rehabilitation, but that the non-parole period should be the minimum period that the offender must spend in gaol having regard to all the elements of punishment, including the objective seriousness of the crime, deterrence and the subjective circumstances. Considerations which the sentencing judge must take into account when fixing the non-parole period are the same as those applicable to fixing the head sentence, although the weight to be attached to such factors and the way in which they are relevant differ due to the different purposes behind each function. A serious offence warrants a greater non-parole period due to its deterrent effect upon others, but the nature of the offence does not assume the importance it has when the head sentence is determined: Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 at 531-2. Considerations of general deterrence are at least equally significant to both decisions which are, in any event, interrelated: Simpson at 64.34 I am therefore satisfied that his Honour erred in not giving sufficient weight to the significance of punishment, denunciation, deterrence and protection of the community in fixing the non-parole period. Whilst it was open to his Honour to find that there were “special circumstances” because of the respondent’s age, that this was his first conviction and the other matters referred to, nevertheless, I am satisfied that the non-parole period set by his Honour failed to reflect adequately the objective seriousness of the offence and the necessary punitive considerations. Ground 2 has been made good. 
     
      
    GROUND 3: His Honour underestimated the objective gravity of the offence.35 His Honour referred to the fact that the offence involved the loss of a human life, possession by the respondent of a loaded firearm, the fact that the deceased was himself young, intoxicated and behaving obnoxiously, the lack of provocation and described it in as irrational, stupid and without reason; but he did not refer to the failure to stop and render assistance, that he and his co-offender calmly walked back to the car and drove away thus showing callousness and lack of concern for the plight of the deceased, that the killing took place in a public place, that there were other people present and the subsequent bragging about the shooting in the admissions he made to his friends. As to the objective criminality of the offence, there were absolutely no mitigating factors.  
     
      
    36 It may be that the deceased was intoxicated and acting obnoxiously, including making an offensive gesture to the applicant and his co-offender as they drove past, but the actions of the respondent and his co-offender in stopping the car and parking it, getting out with a loaded firearm, and approaching the other two youths, showed that the respondent and his companion were looking for trouble, they were looking for a confrontation and one can only conclude that the respondent took the gun with him to use if necessary in such confrontation, not necessarily to shoot, but at least to frighten the youth who had upset him. 37 Many murders arise out of domestic arguments or out of some related activity such as drug trafficking, armed robbery, intoxication, a defective personality, but this offence was virtually a random killing.  
     
      
    38 His Honour also referred to the fact that some of the admissions made in the recorded conversation with “Jennifer” were more troubling because they indicated a more serious frame of mind, but rejected them because the respondent MAY have been speaking out of bravado or fear or otherwise, and he was not satisfied of their veracity. There was no evidence to this effect, but only a submission from the Bar table and therefore no basis for rejecting that material. 
     
      
    39 Whilst I would be reluctant to infer that his Honour did not have all of these additional factors in mind simply because he did not specifically refer to them, the sentence imposed, even allowing for all the mitigating subjective features, satisfies me that either his Honour underestimated the objective gravity of the offence, or if he did assess it properly, he failed to give it sufficient weight in imposing the sentence, and this ground is established.  
     
      
    GROUND 4: His Honour erred in finding that the respondent was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his age. 
     
      
    40 This Court has held that where immaturity due to youth is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in a case of an adult of more mature years: R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37, 124 A Crim R 451 at [25]; and in such cases, the allowance for youth may be greater despite the fact that the offence involved is a relatively serious one. This principle can apply in cases where the conduct constituting the offence is impulsive or a reaction influenced by the immaturity of youth, but not where there is pre-meditated violence as was the case here, by confronting the victim and his companion with a loaded gun.  
     
      
    41 In this case, there was no basis for any finding of the respondent not being fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his age. He was 17 years and 3 months and knew that if he fired a gun at another person almost at point blank range, he was likely to cause serious harm and probably death. In any event, the plea of guilty on the ground of reckless indifference to human life involved an acknowledgement that he realised the probability that death would result from his actions: Crabbe v The Queen 156 CLR 464. This ground has been made good. 
     
      
    GROUND 5: That the finding that the offender was a person of good character was not supported by the evidence. 
     
      
    42 His Honour found at [39] and [49] that the respondent had no prior convictions and was generally of good character, somewhat remitted by the fact that he carried a loaded firearm in public, but the Crown submits that there were a number of other matters which should have been taken into account and further qualified the finding of generally good character. These matters included the disposal of the gun, the “flight” to Lebanon, the bragging to his friends about the killing, the inconsistent versions he had given about his involvement in the offence to police, Dr Lennings and the Juvenile Justice officer, and that he had been using illegal drugs. In my opinion, it was open to his Honour to find the applicant was generally of good character subject to the carrying of the loaded firearm in public. The only additional matter which I consider was relevant to his character was his use of illegal drugs. The other matters relied on, it seems to me, went either to the objective gravity of the offence or the timing and sincerity of his contrition and remorse. Ground 5 fails.  
     
      
    GROUND 6: That the discount of the plea of guilty was excessive in the circumstances.43 In R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 at [160] the Court laid down a number of guidelines concerning the discount appropriate to be allowed for pleas of guilty including the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Sentencing Judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant – contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter.  
        
       
       
        
        (b) Where the other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate.  
        
       
       
        
        (c) The utilitarian value of a plea should usually be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range the particular case should fall is the timing of the plea.  
        
       
       
        
        (d) The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, for example, on the date fixed for trial unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial at [155]. 
        
       
      
    44 In the case of the respondent, his Honour allowed an overall discount of 25 percent having regard not only to the utilitarian value of the plea, but also to contrition and the fact that the grief of the family would not be exacerbated by a trial.  
     
      
    45 He also said that the plea was entered on the first day of the trial and preceded the voir dire (which would have included argument on the admissibility of the admission made to “Jennifer”) and the empanelling of the jury, and that the respondent and his co-offender had admitted wrongful conduct at a “relatively early stage of proceedings” indicating a willingness to facilitate the course of justice as well as some aspects of contrition: at [44].  
     
      
    46 In my opinion, the discount of 25 percent for all aspects of the plea of guilty was excessive in the circumstances. 47 The plea of guilty was not entered on the first day, 14 July 2003. At that stage, he was charged with murder and attempted murder (for attempting to fire at the deceased’s friend, Andrew Clayton). He offered to plead guilty to murder on the first day on the basis that there be no further proceedings in respect of the attempted murder charge and on the factual basis that he had not fired the gun. The second day was taken up with a view. On the third day, the Crown accepted the offer to plead guilty to murder and agreed that there would be no further proceedings in relation to the attempted murder count, and it was then that the plea was entered but at that stage, it was anticipated there would still be a factual dispute on the issue of who fired the gun, and as to the admissibility of the recorded conversation with “Jennifer”. The respondent’s matter was then adjourned to 4 August so that reports could be obtained from Juvenile Justice and a psychologist, and it was on that day that the respondent through his counsel, formally admitted that he had fired the fatal shot and the Crown Case Statement in relation to him was admitted without objection as a statement of the facts in the case. 
     
      
    48 The entry of the plea certainly had significant utilitarian value but it could not fairly be classed as an “early” plea. The other aspects of the plea, namely contrition, and the fact that the grief of the family would not be exacerbated by a trial, were both also of reduced significance having regard to the facts of the case.  
     
      
    49 It would not have been necessary for any of the members of the deceased family to give evidence, so they were not vulnerable as witnesses, although the trial would undoubtedly have been painful for them. In relation to the element of contrition and admission of wrongdoing, this was late and then only grudgingly given.  
     
      
    50 Following the shooting, the respondent had at least twice bragged about it to his friends and later to “Jennifer”. He and his co-accused had fled to Lebanon shortly after the shooting and although they had returned, the respondent had not come forward with any confession over a period of 12 months and when arrested, although admitting he was present, claimed that the co-offender, Diab had fired the fatal shot, also claiming that he did not see the gun and was unaware that it was in the car. Then after the formal entry of the plea of guilty on 16 July, although he told Dr Lennings on 29 July that it was he who shot the deceased, on the following day he told the Juvenile Justice officer that he did not pull the trigger and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also gave inconsistent versions as to how he came into possession of the gun, telling the Juvenile Justice officer that he had borrowed it from a friend for protection because he had been bashed, but telling Dr Lennings that he had purchased the gun to make him feel brave after he had been assaulted. The admission of the full extent of his involvement in the death of the deceased was therefore only made grudgingly, and after the plea of guilty had been entered. 
     
      
    51 He did express some contrition, but this also appears to have come only in his interviews with the Juvenile Justice officer and Dr Lennings after the plea had been entered. 
     
      
    52 Having regard to these circumstances, I consider that a discount of around 15 percent was appropriate to take into account all the relevant elements of the plea, and that a discount of 25 percent in the circumstances of this case was excessive. 
     
      
    GROUND 7: The sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    53 I have already identified what I consider to be a number of errors in his Honour’s reasoning in determining the respondent’s sentence and it is not necessary to repeat them. For the same reason, it is not necessary to again elaborate on the significant features relevant to the objective circumstances of the offence or the subjective circumstances of the respondent, but having regard to the various matters set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate and that this Court should set it aside and re-sentence the applicant, bearing in mind the principles which apply in such circumstances: R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562-3. 
     
      
    54 That means that in re-sentencing the respondent, the Court gives recognition to the element of double jeopardy involved (in twice standing for sentence) by imposing a sentence which is somewhat less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance. This has variously been described as “the least sentence which could properly have been imposed …at first instance”: R v Rose (unreported – CCA – 23 May 1996), as “one which is at the bottom of the range”: R v Giam (No 2) [1999] NSWCCA 378, (1999) 109 A Crim R 348 at [28], and one “towards the lower end of the range of available sentences”: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA, 202 CLR 321 at [62]. See also R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA, 111 A Crim R 152 at [101], [205]-[206]. 
     
      
    55 I therefore propose that the Crown appeal be allowed, that the sentence imposed on the respondent be quashed and in lieu thereof, that he be sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years, such sentence to be deemed to have commenced on 18 April 2002, and to expire on 17 April 2018. I would fix a non-parole period of 11 years to expire on 17 April 2013 on which date the respondent will be eligible to be released on parole. I would confirm his Honour’s order that the respondent serve that sentence in a children’s detention facility until he turns 21 years.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS AJ: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: ""KBM"" (the applicant) is, at law, a child. He was born on 29 March 1988. He pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years, an offence under s66A of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment. The offence was committed on 4 March 2002. The victim was nine years old. KBM was thirteen years old, it being approximately three weeks before his fourteenth birthday. On 5 December 2003, Puckeridge DCJ sentenced KBM to imprisonment for a period of three years, to be served in a juvenile detention centre. His Honour fixed a non parole period of twelve months to date from 5 December 2003 and to expire 4 December 2004. KBM appeals against that sentence, alleging that it was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      The facts. 
       
      
    3 The circumstances in which the offence was committed are not in doubt. KBM and the victim attended the same school. The victim was in the habit of walking home from school. She lived with her mother in a caravan park which was close by. To get to the caravan park, she was required to make a short journey across a playing field. 
     
      
    4 The victim finished school on 4 March 2002 at 3.30 pm. She began walking home. She became aware that she was being followed. She looked behind her and recognised the appellant as a boy from school. She had met him at the home of a woman who was a friend of her mother. She knew his nickname. As she crossed the field he caught up with her. He grabbed her from behind, placing his hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming. He dragged her behind a brick wall. The statement of facts, which formed part of the material handed by agreement to the sentencing Judge, included the following summary of what then occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He pushed her to her knees, removed his penis from his shorts, and forced it into the mouth of [the victim]. [The victim], although trying to resist him from doing this, was unable to do so. The young person forced [the victim] onto her back and pulled her skirt around her waist. As she was resisting, the young person told her that if she did so, he would break her fingers. He also pulled her knickers down around her legs, and straddled her with his legs on either side of her. The young person attempted to force his penis into [the victim's] mouth as she was pinned to the ground."" 
        
       
      
    5 Luckily the victim's mother was keeping a watch for her daughter. From the caravan park she had a view across the park. When she did not see her daughter shortly after 3.30 pm she decided to investigate. She set out for the school. As she walked across the park she heard her daughter's screams. She went behind the brick wall and saw KBM on top of her daughter with his penis in her mouth. She yelled and the young man fled.  
     
      
    6 The police and the ambulance were then summoned. The victim was taken to a local hospital and examined by a paediatrician. She provided a history which the paediatrician summarised in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He attempted oral penetration but did not touch her genitals or attempt penile penetration ..."" 
        
       
      
    7 The doctor noted a number of abrasions to the victim's nose, to her back and near her left breast. She had scratches to the right lower arm. There were other complaints of pain, although no suggestion of significant or lasting physical injury. 
     
      
    8 The victim was able to tell the police her assailant's nickname. He was arrested the following day, although allowed to remain at home. He agreed to participate in an identification parade. A number of parades were arranged on 21 March 2001. He was separately identified by both the victim and her mother. 
     
      
    9 A search warrant was executed upon KBM's home. Certain clothing was seized. It was sent for examination and DNA analysis. The report of that analysis was provided on 9 January 2003. It included an examination of the board shorts of KBM. That examination revealed both the DNA of KBM and that of the victim. 
     
      
    10 The effect upon the victim has been significant. It was obviously a terrifying experience. She has lost confidence and her sense of independence. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case. 
       
      
    11 KBM is his mother's fourth child. His three siblings are somewhat older. They share the same father, whereas KBM has a different father, whom he has not met. His father is aboriginal. KBM has met his paternal grandparents and, to a degree, identifies with his aboriginal heritage. He has expressed the wish to meet his father. By any standards his childhood has been deprived. He describes it as having been unhappy. His mother lives alone. She is poor and has suffered from depression. They have lived a nomadic existence which has necessitated frequent changes of school. 
     
      
    12 At the age of eleven KBM was given into the care of a trusted friend, a man aged about 50. He remained with that person for about three months. During that time he was sexually assaulted, both orally and anally. To add to the torment, he was shown forged letters which suggested that his family did not want him home. He felt frightened of this man. Ultimately he disclosed to his mother and sister his fears and described his treatment. He was then rescued. The man was charged. He later committed suicide. 
     
      
    13 At the age of thirteen, that is in the year before this offence, KBM began smoking marijuana. Sometimes he smoked every day. He also experimented briefly with LSD. Approximately seven months before the offence he attempted to hang himself. He was found by his sister, although he said that even had he not been found he would not have gone through with it. At the time he was in conflict with his mother. 
     
      
    14 After the offence the family, including KBM's mother, recognised that his interests required a more stable environment than his mother could provide, by reason of her mental health. His sister then looked after him. She is 22 years old and he did well under her care. He attended school regularly, completing assignments that had been given to him. His academic progress to that point had not been good. 
     
      
    15 The Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 requires that a child (defined as ""a person under the age of eighteen years"") who is brought before the Court must be examined by a counsellor from the Department of Juvenile Justice, who then reports to the Court (s25(2)). KBM was examined by Ms Jeannette Liva. A report was prepared. Ms Liva noted that KBM had been diagnosed with ADD, but was not on medication. She recorded the following observation made by his school principal in the months before the offence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[The principal] was very supportive in her assessment of [KBM]. [He] would occasionally spend some time during school holidays at [the principal's] house. [She] observed [KBM's] escalating overt sexualised behaviour at school and became involved with the school counsellor and [KBM's mother] in efforts to gain a referral for [KBM] to attend Rivendell. It was hoped [KBM] would receive intensive counselling to address his sexualised behaviour and thinking errors. [The principal] attended case conferences that included an Adolescent Psychologist who was completing the assessment. The referral did not happen and this was the cause of much frustration for everyone involved. [The principal] reports that herself and the school counsellor assessed [KBM] as being severely emotionally disturbed. She states [KBM] displayed bizarre behaviour in the classroom and gave an example of a time when [KBM] deliberately tipped red paint all over himself."" 
        
       
      
    16 Ms Liva was involved in the Sex Offenders Programme of the Department of Juvenile Justice. She recommended that KBM be given a supervised community order, subject to the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. To accept the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice. 
        
       
       
        
        2. To attend and fully participate in counselling as provided or approved by the Sex Offender Program, Department of Juvenile Justice. 
        
       
       
        
        3. To have no unsupervised contact with children under the age of 12. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Not to change residence without the prior approval of the Department of Juvenile Justice."" 
        
       
      
    17 Ms Liva gave evidence before the sentencing Judge. KBM had expressed deep shame and remorse concerning the offence. He had empathy for his victim, which was a positive sign in terms of his rehabilitation. Almost two years had elapsed since the offence. There had been no further reports of overt sexual behaviour. Were he to remain with his sister, Ms Liva did not believe he presented ""a high risk to the community, provided he continued to have a stable and secure environment"". 
     
      
    18 In cross examination, Ms Liva was asked to comment upon the desirability or otherwise of a custodial sentence. She said this: (T9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Now if he was to be sentenced to serve time in a detention centre, would that be in the community's or his best interests in your opinion? 
         
        A. It would be in no one's best interests. Research shows that incarceration can increase the risk for recidivism rather than minimise it. To minimise any risk to the community would be for him to be in the community receiving intensive therapeutic intervention. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. The best possible thing for the community is for him to be - have a supervised community based order and receive intensive therapeutic intervention."" 
        
       
      
    19 There was conflicting evidence concerning KBM's intellectual capacity. He was referred to a psychologist, Dr Hayes. Dr Hayes carried out a number of tests. They revealed borderline intellectual disability and some deficits in complex problem solving ability. There was evidence of moderate anxiety and depression. Dr Hayes thought that KBM would benefit from extensive counselling. On the other hand, the actor, Ms Rachel Ward, who worked with KBM, found him to be ""bright"". In the stable environment of his sister, his academic work had markedly improved. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing remarks. 
       
      
    20 In respect of certain offences, a young offender may be dealt with under a less punitive regime established by the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. However, where a child has committed ""a serious children's indictable offence"" (as defined), there is an obligation to deal with the offender ""according to law"" (s17). The principles under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 then apply. 
     
      
    21 Here, the offence under s66A of the Crimes Act 1900 has been prescribed by regulation as ""a serious children's indictable offence"" within s17 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. As such, it had to be dealt with according to law. The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    22 His Honour, having described the offence and the subjective details of KBM's life, remarked that many of the circumstances of the case were tragic for both the victim and the offender. He then said this: (p7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I, of course, take all matters referred to in the report of Susan Hayes, and the counsellor, into account. They are certainly mitigating factors, but I cannot remove from my consideration, the gravity of the offence on a child under ten years of age, and the effect, and according to her statement, the continuing effect on that child."" 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour then considered the alternatives to a custodial sentence, as advocated by the counsellor, Ms Liva. He said this: (p 9/10) 
     
      
       
        
        ""That evidence has led me to carefully consider the preferred option as to whether or not it would be better for the offender to remain with his elder sister, and to receive supervision from the Juvenile Justice Department. In particular, supervision and counselling under the direction of Jeanette Liva. 
        
       
       
        
        With the best will that I have to the offender, however, I cannot escape from the gravity of the offence that was committed on a young child under the age of ten years. But for the plea of guilty, which the accused entered at Lismore Court on 22 May 2003, and taking into account all the circumstances as referred to in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I would consider that the minimum non parole period would have to be a period of custody of sixteen months. I consider that the plea was entered at the earliest possible time, and that the offender is entitled to a full discount of 25 percent. That being the situation, the term of imprisonment which I impose, that is the minimum term of imprisonment that I impose, will be a period of twelve months, which period of imprisonment is to commence from today's date, 5 December 2003 and to expire on 4 December 2004."" 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour ordered that the term be served in a Juvenile Detention Centre. Thereafter his Honour said this: (p11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The normal additional term is one-third of the sentence. There are, in this case, ample special circumstances to indicate that it would be appropriate that that additional sentence be longer. It is to be the situation that on the 4 December 2004, the offender is to be released on parole and subject to the supervision of the Juvenile Justice Department and to obey all directions of that department, particularly in relation to sexual counselling and anger and drug abuse."" 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour indicated that he had taken into account s6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, which set out the principles relating to the exercise of criminal justice in respect of children. 
     
      
      The grounds of appeal. 
      
    26 The application for leave to appeal identified eight grounds. The grounds are not stated in the form of propositions, but rather are discussed in counsel's written submissions. Paraphrasing the complaints made by counsel in respect to the sentence, they are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1: 
         That the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2:  
        This his Honour sentenced according to the current sentencing regime introduced on 1 February 2003, whereas the offence occurred in 2002. His Honour was required to sentence in accordance with the previous regime. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3: 
         His Honour failed to take account of the fact that the offence was committed by a young person upon another young person. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 4:  
        His Honour failed to give weight to the applicant's plea of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 5:  
        His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the views of Ms Liva, the specialist counsellor. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 6:  
        His Honour undervalued the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation and its relevance to the sentence to be imposed. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 7:  
        His Honour overvalued the gravity of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 8:  
        His Honour failed to give weight to the appellant's aboriginality. 
        
       
       
      Error Acknowledged. 
       
      
    27 It is, however, unnecessary to deal with each ground. The Crown drew attention to a recent decision of this Court, R v Mako [2004] NSWCCA 90 which dealt with the same issue as raised by ground 2, concerning the changes to s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, by the amending Act of 2002 (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002). The amending Act, as the name implies, introduced ""standard non parole periods"" for certain offences committed after 1 February 2003. The standard non parole period was to be imposed unless the court determined (with reasons) that a longer or shorter period was appropriate. To fit in with that requirement, s44 was amended so as to read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        s44 Court to set non-parole period 
        
       
       
        
         (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision)."" 
        
       
      
    28 Before the amendment, s44 was, relevantly, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        S44 Court to set term of sentence and non-parole period 
        
       
       
        
        (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, a court is required: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision."" 
        
       
      
    29 KBM committed the offence on 4 March 2002. The offence was, as mentioned, a ""serious children's indictable offence"" as defined by s3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. His Honour was obliged to deal with KBM ""according to law"" (s17). Although sentenced on 5 December 2003, that is after the amending Act, it had no application. It only applied to offences committed after 1 February 2003. His Honour, therefore, was obliged to sentence according to s44 in its previous form. 
     
      
    30 The terms of the sentence made it clear that his Honour applied the new regime. The Court in R v Mako (supra) determined that to be an error. The Crown therefore conceded error and that it was open to this Court to intervene if it believed that a sentence other than that imposed was warranted in law (s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). 
     
      
       
      Is another sentence warranted? 
       
      
    31 The offence was plainly serious. The effects upon the victim were not likely to be short lived. Although the offender had to be dealt with ""according to law"" that did not require that he should be dealt with as though he were an adult. The principles set out in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 relating to the administration of criminal justice, in the context of a child, had application (R v WRK (1993) 32 NSWLR 447, per Hunt CJ at CL at 449). The Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
      "" 
      s6 Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
       
       
        
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind."" 
        
       
      
    32 Commenting upon these principles Mathews J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA agreed) in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112, said this: (at 116) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Some of these guidelines consist of sentiments and admonitions which are so general as to be of little assistance in the sentencing of young offenders. However due regard must be paid to subss (c) and (d), both of which would favour a non-custodial penalty being imposed on the present applicant."" 
        
       
      
    33 That was a case involving a series of offences, all serious. The offender was 15 years old when sentenced. He had pleaded guilty to two counts of maliciously destroying or damaging property. He and a number of others had broken into a factory at Parramatta. Once inside, they had endeavoured to open a safe, using a power drill. They were unsuccessful. They had ransacked the premises, and then set them on fire. Damage totalling $550,000 was caused. 
     
      
    34 Some of the group, including GDP, thereafter went by train to Seven Hills. They broke into another factory. Again they ransacked and vandalised the premises, before setting the premises on fire. Damage of approximately $1 million was caused, although the fire was said to be the consequence of actions by a co-offender rather than GDP. The sentencing Judge imposed a sentence on GDP of 12 months incarceration in a juvenile detention centre, with supervision for a further period of 12 months. The offender appealed, asserting that the sentence was excessive. 
     
      
    35 On appeal, the Court emphasised the importance of rehabilitation. In R v Smith [1964] Crim LR 70, the Court said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the case of a young offender there can rarely be any conflict between his interest and the public's. The public have no greater interest than that he should become a good citizen.""  
        
       
      
    36 Adopting these remarks, Yeldham J in Wilcox (Supreme Court (NSW), unreported, 15.8.79) said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... in the case of a youthful offender ... considerations of punishment and of general deterrence of others may properly be largely discarded in favour of individualised treatment of the offender, directed to his rehabilitation."" 
        
       
      
    37 Citing these cases and applying these principles, Mathews J said this: (at 116) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Returning then, to the case of the present applicant. Had it been an adult who had committed these offences, then the principles of retribution and, more importantly, general deterrence, would have demanded a custodial sentence of considerable length. But rehabilitation must be the primary aim in relation to an offender as young as this applicant. The evidence indicates that he has already rehabilitated himself to a substantial degree. He has now commenced Year 12, and thus faces the Higher School Certificate later this year. He is performing well in his studies, and is an outstanding sportsman. It would, on all accounts, be positively damaging to his rehabilitative prospects to remove him from this environment and return him to custody."" 
        
       
      
    38 The Court ordered the offender's immediate release on probation. 
     
      
    39 As an offender increases in age and approaches adulthood it may be appropriate, depending upon the nature of the crime, to strike a different balance between rehabilitation, deterrence and denunciation. In R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, Lee CJ at CL (with whom Gleeson CJ and Hunt J agreed) said this, in the context of one offender who was 17 and another who was 19: (at 135) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes."" 
        
       
      
    40 Here, the offender was very young indeed. He was approaching 14 years. His immaturity was relevant to the offence in a number of ways. He had failed to exercise self control. He was bound to be found out. The person he attacked was someone who went to the same school, who knew him. 
     
      
    41 In determining whether another sentence was warranted and whether this Court should intervene, the question becomes what is most likely to assist in KBM's rehabilitation, which is not to say that deterrence and denunciation are completely irrelevant. 
     
      
    42 The Juvenile Justice counsellor, Ms Liva, was in no doubt that KBM should remain with his sister, attending at the local High School where he was making good progress. In the passage set out above, she made it plain that she thought incarceration would impede his rehabilitation. She took that view for a number of reasons. First, research demonstrated that incarceration of youthful offenders increased the risk of recidivism. Secondly, KBM needed counselling and therapy, which is simply not available in a juvenile detention centre. In her evidence, she described what she believed KBM needed in these words: (T9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What do you anticipate you could do for [KBM] over the period? 
         
        A. The department would provide weekly sessions, weekly one hour sessions with [KBM] initially, and that would, depending on [KBM's] level of participation, that would gradually ease off. We would be looking at a period of two years."" 
        
       
       
      When cross examined by the Crown, Ms Liva said this: (T11) 
       
       
        
        ""Q. But it is the case that in the setting of a detention centre for juveniles, there is facilities for behavioural therapy, isn't there? 
         
        A. Very limited. The psychologists that work in the detention centre have an incredibly high workload, and they're usually, if you talk to them, they're usually fire fighting. They don't have a lot of time to put into interventions."" 
        
       
      
    43 Thirdly, it is likely that KBM will at some point be transferred to a centre with older boys, known as ""Acmena"". Ms Liva identified the likely consequences of that transfer as follows: (T12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You've given some evidence about the position with respect to [KBM] residing with his family, and you've made references to the need for a stable consistent environment? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That's something that the system of detention centres for juveniles also aims to achieve isn't it? 
         
        A. It is. The peers that he would be - one of his major problems is his lack of peer relationships. The peer relationships that he could build within Acmena would not be what we would deem appropriate."" 
        
       
      
    44 I am persuaded that a different sentence is warranted. The Court should intervene and resentence. The Court was furnished with material describing KBM's position since he was sentenced. On 16 December 2003 (a matter of weeks after the sentence was passed), Ms Liva furnished a further report. The report warned of possible victimisation in a detention centre. Ms Levi also said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[KBM] demonstrates symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, these symptoms could be exacerbated by the fear of further abuse within detention centres."" 
        
       
      
    45 That was, of course, a reference to the sexual abuse suffered by KBM at the age of eleven years (supra para 11) . Ms Levi repeated in her further report the substance of what she had said to the Court, namely:  
     
      
       
        
        ""[KBM's] sister, T, has undertaken to provide a stable home life, provide supervision and ensure that [KBM] maintains a high level of attendance at school. This is in contrast to his transient background and an essential component of future risk reduction for [KBM]."" 
        
       
      
    46 Unfortunately it appears that Ms Levi's prediction of harassment has proved accurate. A report of 8 April 2004, prepared by the centre where KBM has been held, included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""On 5.12.03 [KBM] was admitted to Reiby JJC. He was A classified due to the severity of his offence. He has now been reclassified to B status. Since his admission he has not presented as a management problem. He has not to date received a minor misbehaviour and is on the highest level within the incentive scheme. Although [KBM] is compliant and able to relate well to staff, he has difficulty establishing friendships with his peers. [KBM] is a young man who is not interested in the traditional male adolescent activities. He stands out as different from the main population in custody. He has been the victim of harassment and one serious incident on 15.1.04 when he was taken hostage by another detainee. Although he has learnt coping strategies to better manage within a custody environment he still suffers anxiety attacks. The frequency and intensity of these attacks are reducing. [KBM] has been the victim of harassment and trauma both in custody and in the community and he strongly identifies in the victim role."" 
        
       
      
    47 The report, however, was not entirely bleak. It also included these words, which are important to KBM's prospects of rehabilitation: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[KBM] is currently completing his year 10 through distance education. He has demonstrated the ability and application to achieve his School Certificate. He is also enrolled in TAFE Textiles and hospitality course."" 
        
       
      
    48 It is apparent from the report that, in terms of the juvenile justice system, KBM is at the cross roads. He has turned sixteen years. He is about to be transferred to Acmena.  
     
      
    49 However, in my view KBM's rehabilitation is best served by his immediate release into the custody of his sister so that he can be supervised thereafter by the Department of Juvenile Justice in accordance with the recommendation of Ms Levi in her report. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    50 The order I propose therefore is as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal is given. 
       
       
      2. The appeal is allowed. 
       
       
      3. The sentence of Puckeridge DCJ of 5 December 2003 is varied in respect of the non parole period which is to date from 5 December 2003 until today, 3 May 2004.  
        
      KBM is to be released forthwith into the custody of his sister, Teboni, and to be subject to her supervision and that of the Department of Juvenile Justice, including the sexual and other counselling recommended by the Department in its report of 5 December 2003, such supervision to continue until 4 December 2006, being the expiration of the sentence. 
       
      
    51 BELL J: I agree with Kirby J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Sperling J: On 5 May 2003, following a plea of guilty, the applicant was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for four and a half years with a non-parole period of two years and three months on one count of detaining for advantage. The maximum penalty for that offence is 14 years' imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The facts of the case are set out in a fact sheet tendered at the sentencing hearing. The facts, as there recorded, are as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        About 6pm on Friday 21 June 2002, the victim was loading some items into her car from a flat located at 10/6 Fowler Street, Hamilton South. During this activity she was unable to lift one of the bags. She went down to another unit to seek assistance from her friend. However, the friend was not home. She then went to another flat where she knew the occupants, again to seek assistance to carry the bag. There she saw the offender who she said was not known to her. When she requested assistance he offered to help on condition that she give him a lift to the Nineways at Broadmeadow. The offender then went with the victim and carried the items to her car.  
        
       
       
        
        The victim and the offender then got into the car and she drove him towards the Nineways. Part way through the journey the offender requested the victim to drive him to Charlestown. Given that the offender had assisted her, she agreed and headed towards Charlestown. At this stage of the journey the offender started behaving strangely, directing the victim through back streets muttering strange things to himself and constantly checking that they were not being followed by police. The victim began to fear for her welfare, but complied with the offender’s directions and demands with a view that he would soon be out of her car. The offender then directed the victim to a set of units in Windale. There the offender’s behaviour became even stranger. He indicated to the victim that people outside the units were police and that they were after him. He told the victim that she herself was a police officer. He further indicated that he was going to get out of the car and, ‘Take as many with him as possible’, using the victim for his cover. The victim’s level of fear and concern rose but she was unable to determine how to get rid of the offender. She was then directed to other addresses where the offender’s behaviour did not alter.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender then directed the victim to drive him to the Broadmeadow area, which she did. The offender threatened to punch the victim to the face and shoot her and kill her if she did not comply. At Broadmeadow the offender directed the victim to drive him to Bridges St, Charlestown. The victim was not aware of such an address and believed that she would be seriously assaulted, raped or killed if she didn’t do what he said. After stopping at further addresses as directed the offender told the victim to drive to the Police Boys Club at Windale. Upon arrival at the club car park the offender ordered that the victim let him drive and told her that she should get in the passenger seat. Fearing for her well-being the victim complied with this direction. The offender then drove at high speed from the club and continued into Lake St and a number of other streets in the Windale area driving in a dangerous and erratic manner. So much so that the victim considered jumping from the vehicle to avoid being killed in an accident. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender on a number of occasions took hold of the victim by the hands whilst he was driving in order to stop her from jumping from the vehicle. During the journey the offender collided with a number of sign posts and median strips causing an amount of minor damage to the vehicle. Further, during this journey on a number of occasions, the offender told the victim he was going to rape her and possibly kill her. At 9.30pm the offender drove the victim’s car into a driveway at Campton Close, Jewells. The offender then dragged the victim from the car and forced her on to the ground laying on top of her to restrain her. A short time later the offender dragged the victim to her feet and took hold of a handful of her flesh on the stomach area and walked her around the nearby streets.  
        
       
       
        
        At this time the offender informed the victim that he had a gun and would, ‘Blow her liver through her stomach’, if she did anything stupid. The victim recalls having an unknown object pushed in to her back, at the time believing it possibly to be a gun. Whilst walking the victim around the streets the offender threatened to throw her into the path of several approaching motor vehicles, and then on other occasions throw her into gardens to hide from approaching vehicles believing them to be police vehicles. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender then dragged the victim into a nearby street, still adopting the same grip on her stomach, and with the object pointed into her back. He forced her to the ground on a driveway. The offender sat behind her and wrapped his legs and arms around her in a restraining manner. At this time the offender directed the victim interlock her arms into the sleeves of her jacket. The victim believed that an occupant of a nearby house came out but was told to go inside or be shot. She recalls the door being shut. Whilst the victim was being held on the driveway, police arrived at the scene. Police approached and directed the offender release the victim. He was called upon to do so several times and eventually released her only after seeing police produce capsicum spray. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim broke free of the offender’s grip and fled on foot. The offender was arrested and conveyed to Charlestown police station. Upon his arrival at the police station the offender appeared to be drug affected. He was muttering to himself and was erratic in his behaviour. When asked if he would be interviewed in relation to the matters he acknowledged that he took the victim against her will but would not comment any further or participate in any form of interview. 
        
       
       
        
        As a result of the incident, the victim had a large bruised area on her stomach where the offender had hold of her. This is shown in photographs tendered with the material on sentence [in Exhibit A]. As a result of the offender driving the victim’s car at speed, and in an erratic manner, the vehicle sustained severe engine damage and minor panel damage. 
        
       
      
    3 The sentencing judge found that, objectively, the offence was a very serious one. The victim was put in fear and suffered physical violence. 
     
      
    4 Subjective matters taken into account by the sentencing judge included the age of the applicant, 23 years at the time of the offence and 25 years at the time of sentencing, the applicant’s criminal history, his upbringing and drug problems. 
     
      
    5 The criminal history of the applicant disclosed that most of his past offences had involved matters of dishonesty, drugs or driving, although there was one conviction for assault. 
     
      
    6 A pre-sentence report indicated that the applicant was known to the Probation and Parole Service since 1996 and had been subject to supervision on a number of occasions. On all such occasions, it was said that the applicant’s response was either superficial or non-compliant with breach action resulting in relation to each order. His Honour noted, however, that the pre-sentence report also revealed subjective considerations which were favourable to the applicant. His family had broken up when he was five years of age. There was harassment by his father which resulted in his mother becoming addicted to alcohol until her death. The applicant’s father was physically and emotionally violent towards the applicant until his death. The applicant was sexually abused for a year by a neighbour who was subsequently gaoled for the offences. The family was quite dysfunctional, requiring the applicant and his siblings to virtually raise themselves. At the age of 13, the applicant became a poly drug user with regular use of amphetamines from the age of 12, then heroin from the age of 22. There had been long periods of unemployment. The applicant felt devastated for the victim and recognised the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    7 A report by Dr Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, indicated that, at the time of the offence, the applicant was suffering from a drug-induced psychosis, involving paranoid and delusional behaviour, which explained the applicant’s conduct at the time of the offence. At the time of examination, the applicant was no longer presenting with psychotic symptoms. 
     
      
    8 A handwritten letter from the applicant to the court expressed his remorse. 
     
      
    9 The sentencing judge took into account that the applicant was being held in protective custody. 
     
      
    10 Although the applicant had threatened to rape the victim while the offence was in progress, the sentencing judge was not satisfied that there was any sexual motive behind the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    11 A 20 per cent discount was allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea. 
     
      
    12 The sentence was dated to commence from the expiration of a non-parole period under sentences currently being served by the applicant. 
     
      
    13 His Honour found special circumstances, in that the applicant was still a relatively young man with potential for rehabilitation and the sentence would be served in protection. 
     
      
    14 At the hearing of the appeal, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentence was manifestly excessive having regard, in particular, to the applicant’s psychosis at the time of the offence. It was submitted that the head sentence reflected elements of general and specific deterrence which were not appropriate, having regard to the applicant’s mental state at the time. It was further submitted that the sentencing judge had given insufficient weight to the totality principle in the relationship between the present sentence and the sentences he was serving. It was also submitted that the likelihood of release into a drug rehabilitation programme, with the restraint on liberty which that would involve, was not adequately considered. 
     
      
    15 Concerning the applicant’s psychosis at the time of the offence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        So far as sentence is concerned I am satisfied that, to some extent, issues of general and specific deterrence should be moderated in the sentencing process. I say this because whilst there is no doubt that the psychosis suffered by the offender at the time of the commission of the offence was self induced, the reality is that his drug addiction was brought about no doubt as a result of those factors occurring in his life at an age when he was unable to make decisions for himself. It is hardly surprising that a person with such a background would fall into drug use and abuse. This is not to say that considerations of general deterrence and specific deterrence are not appropriate, simply that some moderation should be exercised in the sentencing process because of the factors to which I have referred. 
        
       
      
    16 It is unnecessary to review the well-known authorities relating to the way in which mental illness bears on the sentencing process. His Honour specifically mentioned the way in which mental illness moderates the consideration of general deterrence. Where mental illness has materially contributed to the offending conduct, it is also a consideration moderating the offender’s culpability, and hence the denunciation and punishment warranted for the offence. That was so obviously a factor in the present case that it cannot have been overlooked by the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    17 As for totality, the sentences being served were for unrelated offences. There was no error in principle in accumulating the present sentence.  
     
      
    18 The fact that the applicant was likely to be discharged into a drug rehabilitation programme was not a weighty consideration. His Honour mentioned this factor and no doubt took it into account. 
     
      
    19 The serious questions for the sentencing judge were a balancing out of conflicting considerations. The subjective features of the case favourable to the applicant had to be weighed against the objective seriousness of the offence. Moral culpability and general deterrence are moderated by mental illness. That, however, is to be weighed against special deterrence and the need to protect the community from repetition of the behaviour which led to and constituted the offence. There are, accordingly, a number of considerations in this case which pulled in different directions.  
     
      
    20 I am not satisfied that the sentencing judge erred in balancing out these conflicting considerations. I am not satisfied, in terms of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed. 
     
      
    21 The orders I propose are accordingly as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    22 Hidden J: I agree with Sperling J. 
     
      
    23 Howie J: I agree with Sperling J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Grove J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Sperling J in draft form and gratefully adopt his summary of the relevant facts and circumstances. I wish to add some brief observations of my own. 
     
      
       
      CONVICTION 
       
      
    2 Sperling J has detailed the complainant’s allegations, the appellant’s denial and the matters alleged to reveal discrepancies or inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence. The lastmentioned were available and no doubt canvassed in address to the jury. In my opinion they do not mandate doubt about the core description of the offences which was available to be accepted by the jury. I agree with his Honour’s reasons for proposing dismissal of the appeal against conviction.  
     
      
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    3 The learned sentencing judge noted the wide range of conduct which could constitute an offence against s 61J of the Crimes Act. It is apt to recall the definition of sexual intercourse (s 61H) includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “……  
        penetration to any extent  
        of the genitalia …… of a female person ….. “ (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    4 The case against the appellant asserted digital penetration. The complainant was asked whether she was able to say how far penetration advanced inside her vagina and she replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, sorry but it was inside, yes”. (T 23) 
        
       
      
    5 There was no medical evidence called by the Crown to demonstrate that damage or injury (in the physical sense) had occurred. 
     
      
    6 Her Honour referred to R v Dent unreported CCA 14 March 1991 where it was said that acts of digital penetration can sometimes more accurately be described and characterized as indecent assaults, albeit serious examples of such. She recorded submission by counsel that the conduct of the appellant was at the lowest end of conduct “caught by s 61J”. However, her Honour did not deal with this submission in terms. She recited the maximum penalty (twenty years imprisonment) for an offence against the section but it is plain that that specification needs to comprehend significantly more serious forms of sexual misconduct: Ibbs v The Queen 1987 163 CLR 447. 
     
      
    7 The learned sentencing judge found that these offences were “extremely serious”. I agree that they were serious but they were not extreme in the context of conduct which is punishable under s 61J. What her Honour failed to do was to contextualize these offences within the range of conduct comprehended by the statutory provision. 
     
      
    8 Counsel at the sentencing proceedings had made a submission that the actual penetration was to the “slightest degree and was not accompanied by physical discomfort, damage or trauma”. Her Honour made no finding as to the degree of penetration. I have recited the complainant’s evidence in that regard. The balance of the submission was rejectable by consideration of the facts of the offences. However, her Honour approached her rejection of the submission that there was on trauma associated with the offence “having regard to the Victim Impact Statement”. As Sperling J has pointed out, such a statement may be given weight in determining the appropriate punishment, but such unsworn and untested material is unlikely to be able to contribute significantly to the finding of facts adverse to an accused which are required to be sustained by proof to the criminal standard. The two offences occurred in close time proximity and it was appropriate to treat them as instances of the one course of conduct. Whilst the crimes were far from trivial, I cannot conceive that on the facts, and having regard to the matters required to be taken into account in favour of the appellant, a head sentence of one quarter of the maximum (available for far more serious instances of sexual misconduct) could be appropriately proportionate in this case. Like the sentencing judge and Sperling J I would alter the proportion of non parole period to head sentence for the reasons which they have given. 
     
      
    9 I would order the appeal against conviction dismissed. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed. Sentences in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the appellant sentenced on each count to three years imprisonment to date from 26 June 2003 with a non parole period of eighteen months to date from 26 June 2003 and expiring on 25 December 2004. The sentences to be served concurrently. The appellant directed to be released to parole on 25 December 2004. 
     
      
    10 Simpson J: I agree, for the reasons given by Sperling J, that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. I agree with both Grove J and Sperling J that, having regard to the objective criminality, the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. I specifically agree that, serious though these offences were, they occupied a relatively low position in the hierarchy of offences against s61J of the Crimes Act 1900. In making that remark, I should not be taken to be minimising either the seriousness of the appellant’s conduct, or its impact upon the complainant; but all offences must be seen on a scale of seriousness. Regrettably, courts have seen many offences against s61J which are dramatically more serious than these. I am, however, very conscious of the circumstances in which the offences were committed. The appellant was the father of the complainant’s close friend, and, while she was a guest in his home, was entrusted with her care and well-being. That circumstance alone is significant in the assessment of the criminality. Criminality cannot be seen only in the light of the relatively minor degree of penetration. I also specifically agree with the observations of Sperling J concerning the use that may be made of a victim impact statement. 
     
      
    11 I agree that the sentences imposed in District Court should be set aside and the appellant re-sentenced. Having regard to all of the circumstances I have mentioned, and the matters recited by Sperling J, I agree with the sentences proposed by Grove J. 
     
      
    12 Sperling J: The appellant was charged on two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (the alleged victim being under 16 years of age), alleged to have been committed between 12 September and 31 October 2000.  
     
      
    13 The offences are constituted by s61J of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 20 years.  
     
      
    14 The appellant pleaded not guilty on both counts and was tried before Morgan DCJ and a jury in the District Court in June 2003. On 26 June 2003, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts. 
     
      
    15 On 1 August 2003, her Honour sentenced the appellant on each count to a term of imprisonment of five years to date from 26 June 2003 (when the appellant was taken into custody), with a non-parole period of three years commencing on 26 June 2003 and expiring on 25 June 2006. 
     
      
    16 The appellant has appealed against conviction and has applied for leave to appeal against severity of sentence. The grounds of appeal are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The Appellant appeals against his conviction on the ground that the Jury’s verdicts were unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        2. In the event that Ground 1. above fails, the Appellant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the penalty imposed on the ground that it was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: The appellant appeals against his conviction on the ground that the jury’s verdicts were unreasonable and cannot be supported on the evidence 
       
      
    17 The principles relating to an appeal against a conviction on this ground are well settled. In Ford (NSW CCA, 9 April 1998, unreported), in a judgment in which Wood CJ at CL and Smart J concurred, I summarised what was said in M (1994) 181 CLR 487, as explained in Jones (1997) 149 ALR 598, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The ultimate question is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A doubt experienced by the appellate court will, generally speaking, be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Doubt by the appellate court is, however, displaced where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence explains how the jury could reasonably have been satisfied of the appellant’s guilt, thus resolving the doubt experienced by the appellate court. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A doubt by the appellate court is not so displaced when the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not capable of being explained away by reference to the manner in which the evidence was given; such as where, on the record, the evidence contains discrepancies or displays inadequacies or is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, the doubt persists. 
        
       
      
    18 The recent decision of the High Court in MFA (2002) 77 ALJR 139 does not require revision of what I said in Ford. 
     
      
    19 Both offences were alleged to have occurred on the same date. The complainant was born on 26 September 1988. The offences being alleged to have occurred in September or October 2000, she was either 11 or 12 years of age at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    20 At that time, the complainant was a pupil at Mount Riverview Public School. The appellant’s daughter, Rebecca, was a pupil at another public school, but the two girls were members of the same netball team and also played touch football together. The appellant was then separated from his wife, who had custody of Rebecca. She and her sister stayed with the appellant every second weekend.  
     
      
    21 The complainant said, in her evidence, that on three or four occasions, she slept over at the appellant’s house, sharing a double bed with Rebecca.  
     
      
    22 Contextual evidence given by the complainant and others narrowed those occasions down to three to which dates could be ascribed, namely, 15 September 2000 (the night of the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympic Games), 19 September 2000 (linked with the complainant’s use of a friend’s mobile phone) and 12 October 2000 (being the night before a fete at Blaxland East Public School held on the weekend of 13-14 October 2000). 
     
      
    23 The complainant said that the offences occurred on the third of those occasions. She said that, after she and Rebecca had gone to bed and Rebecca had apparently gone to sleep, the appellant entered the room, knelt beside the bed, put his hands under the bedcovers, placed two fingers in the complainant’s vagina and moved his fingers around for about two to three minutes. The complainant said that she tried to prevent this by moving away towards Rebecca. The appellant stopped and left the room. According to the complainant, the appellant came into the room again shortly afterwards, again knelt beside the bed, put his hands under the bedcovers, again placed two of his fingers in her vagina and moved his fingers for about a minute. The complainant said she again tried to prevent this by moving away towards Rebecca, and that the appellant stopped and left the room. She said she tried to stay awake as long as possible but eventually fell asleep. She said that, next day, she tried to keep away from the appellant and was driven home. 
     
      
    24 The complainant said that she was on school holidays at the time and that, on the first Wednesday after return to school, she telephoned the Kids Helpline and spoke to a male counsellor. She said she had the number either from a magazine or from a card on the refrigerator at home. She said she was pretty sure she took the number from the information card. The complainant said that school finished for her at 3 pm and that she made the call as soon as she arrived home so that she would be finished before her siblings arrived home after school. They got out at 3.30 pm. 
     
      
    25 Two witnesses from the Kids Helpline were called in the Crown case. Ms K L Litchfield said that the Kids Helpline is a free 24 hour telephone counselling service for five to 18 year olds across Australia. She gave the free call telephone number. She said the service was advertised in schools. Counsellors who staffed the line were required to log every call and mandatory data was recorded, such as date, time, duration of call, the main problem and the outcome of the call. Additionally, if ascertained, a record was made of age, gender and nationality.  
     
      
    26 After search, Ms Litchfield found a match with the field of data given to her by the investigating police, including timeframe, the presenting problem, the age and gender of the caller and that the counsellor was a male. Particulars of the call, according to the Line’s records, were that it was made on 3 November 2000 at 2.35 pm New South Wales time. The caller was a female, noted as aged approximately 13 years. The presenting problem was child abuse. The counsellor’s assessment was one of currently being at risk of sexual abuse. The call had lasted 31 minutes. It was made from a home phone. The perpetrator was described as a friend’s father. The counsellor was noted as Mr D Shankey. 
     
      
    27 Mr Shankey’s evidence was that he worked as a counsellor for the Kids’ Helpline between March 1996 and November 2000. Shown an extract of the line records relating to the call referred to by Ms Litchfield, he said that this showed he had received a call from a girl whom he had assessed as 13 years of age, who told him that she was currently at risk of sexual abuse, that the call was received at 2:35 pm New South Wales time and that the perpetrator was a friend’s father. He added that this was the first time that the girl had used the service.  
     
      
    28 Mr Shankey worked a four to six hour shift each day and took 50 to 60 calls per shift. It was not suggested that he had a recollection of the call. His evidence was a reconstruction from the data and his usual practice.  
     
      
    29 There were a number of respects in which recorded features of the telephone call which was the subject of that evidence did not match evidence given by the complainant in relation to the call which she said she made. First, school resumed on 3 October 2000 after the September-October break. The recorded telephone call was apparently made some three weeks after that rather than on the first Wednesday following the complainant’s return to school as the complainant said. Secondly, the time for the call as recorded was 2.35pm, whereas the plaintiff said that the call was made after school. The complainant’s finishing time at school was 3pm and the school records showed that she attended school on the day recorded for the call. Thirdly, the information card referred to by the complainant was in evidence and the free call number on it for the Helpline was incorrect, there being an extra digit in the middle of the number on the card.  
     
      
    30 The evidence did not disclose whether the date and time of a call to the Helpline was automatically generated in the organisation’s records or was keyed in by the counsellor. Nor did it indicate whether there was a running record kept of calls by date and time, which might confirm or otherwise the date and time of the particular call. Nor was it known whether records relating to calls made from the complainant’s home would confirm or otherwise any call to the Helpline on 3 November 2000 or on any other date.  
     
      
    31 On the hearing of the appeal, the court suggested an enquiry to see if there was a Telstra record of any call from the complainant’s home phone to the Kids Helpline. (The court did not say what would necessarily be done about any such further information if it became available; that was left to be resolved later, if necessary.) However, according to information since conveyed to the court, no such records now exist, if they ever did.  
     
      
    32 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that, in view of these discrepancies, a jury could not reasonably have found as a fact that a telephone call to the Kids Helpline had been made at all by the complainant, particularly when one also had regard to other weaknesses in her evidence to which I shall come.  
     
      
    33 The asserted further discrepancies in the complainant’s evidence were as follows. The complainant believed that the first sleep-over was on a Saturday whereas 15 September 2000 was a Friday. Secondly, the complainant wrongly disagreed with the suggestion that the second sleep-over was on Tuesday 19 September 2000. Thirdly, the complainant said that the offences were committed on the occasion of the third sleep-over, but also that this was during the Olympics, before returning to school after the break and having played netball that day. However, as at 13 October 2000, the date established for the third sleep-over, the Olympics were finished, the complainant had resumed school after the break and the netball season was also over. 
     
      
    34 Further discrepancies asserted in relation to the complainant’s evidence were as follows. It was said that it was inherently unlikely that Rebecca would have fallen asleep within five minutes of the girls going to bed, as the complainant said. The complainant initially told the investigating police that the touching was “around the vagina”, whereas her evidence at the trial was of the appellant inserting his fingers into her vagina. The complainant was said to have been vague and inconsistent in relation to the time delay between the first and second incidents and her position during the second incident. Subsequent contact by the complainant with the appellant was relied on as an inconsistency and contrary to the complainant’s assertion that she thereafter avoided the appellant. 
     
      
    35 There was delay in making a complaint. The police investigation effectively commenced when the complainant made her first electronically recorded interview on 12 March 2001: Tr 78. The complainant’s mother said that she took the complainant to speak to the police after her daughter spoke to her in March 2001. That appears to be the first complaint by the child. There was no evidence of earlier complaint other than the evidence of the Kids Helpline phone call. A consequence was said to be that there was no opportunity of the complainant being examined for any possible injury. 
     
      
    36 Lastly, the bed in which the complainant slept was kept hard against the wall on the side where the complainant slept when visiting. That, it was said, left no room for the appellant to assault the complainant in the manner alleged. 
     
      
    37 The appellant gave evidence at the trial. He denied the offences. His credibility was not effectively impugned so far as appears from the printed page.  
     
      
    38 This was a case of oath against oath. The ultimate question was whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s evidence was truthful and reliable in the respects that mattered, notwithstanding the appellant’s denials on oath and the discrepancies in relation to her evidence such as they were. 
     
      
    39 So far as those discrepancies are concerned, the jury was not obliged to take a serious view of them.  
     
      
    40 As to the date of the Helpline call, it was reasonable that the complainant may have been out by a couple of weeks. As to the time of the call, the school record of her attendance on the date did not exclude the possibility that she may have left school early that day. She had reason to do so, in order to ensure that she would have time for the call before her siblings arrived home from school. It was reasonable that she may have forgotten that she left school early that day, possibly with permission, possibly without. There was also the possibility that the Helpline record of the date and / or the time of the recorded call might have been incorrectly recorded. There was nothing in the point that the counsellor may have assessed the caller to be 13 years of age whereas the complainant was by then 12 years of age. As to the mistake in the toll free number on the card attached to the refrigerator, the complainant did say that she was “pretty sure” that that is where she got the number from but she also said that she might have obtained it from a magazine. The jury was by no means precluded from finding that the call as recorded was a call made by the complainant.  
     
      
    41 As to other asserted discrepancies in the complainant’s evidence, I make the following observations.  
     
      
    42 A mistake as between a Friday and a Saturday for the first sleep-over and misremembering the date of the second sleep-over could be regarded as of no consequence. Similarly, a mistake as to which of the three sleep-overs was the one in question. There was nothing inherently improbable in Rebecca being asleep within five minutes of going to bed.  
     
      
    43 The initial complaint of a touching “around the vagina” was not necessarily inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence, depending on what she meant by “around”. The acts asserted in her evidence could be described as a touching around the vagina in the sense of in the region of the vagina.  
     
      
    44 The vagueness and inconsistency in relation to the time between the two asserted offences and the complainant’s position during the second incident were not fundamental. Vagueness in such respects did not necessarily indicate untruthfulness or unreliability in relation to the matters really at issue.  
     
      
    45 Contact with the appellant after the event was understandable. His daughter, Rebecca, was a close friend and confusion on the complainant’s part about how to behave following such an episode would be predictable.  
     
      
    46 Delay in complaint was explicable on the basis of confusion and embarrassment. The loss of an opportunity of medical examination arising from such delay is without substance. There is no reason to think that medical examination would have revealed anything.  
     
      
    47 As for the bed being against the wall, there was also evidence also that the bed was on castors. The appellant could have pushed it a short distance from the wall, consistently with not waking Rebecca. That is not a detail that one would necessarily expect the complainant to have noticed and remembered in the circumstances. 
     
      
    48 With the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, the jury could reasonably have been satisfied of the appellant’s guilt notwithstanding these discrepancies and deficiencies, such as they were. That being the case, any doubt which this court might have from a bare reading of the transcript is displaced. 
     
      
    49 For these reasons, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: in the event that ground 1 above fails, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the penalty imposed on the ground that it was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    50 In her remarks on sentence, the trial judge reviewed the facts conformably with the implied findings of the jury.  
     
      
    51 The appellant had no previous criminal history. He had been a volunteer fire fighter with the Rural Fire Service for a number of years. He had the support of his family and continued to have access to his two daughters each fortnight. He had a good working record. His employment with the State Rail Authority was suspended following an earlier jury verdict (subsequently overturned and resulting in a second trial). The appellant was being held in protective custody. There were references attesting to his good character. 
     
      
    52 Her Honour acknowledged the wide range of conduct which is the subject of s61J requiring careful examination of the conduct in question so that it could properly be placed in the hierarchy of seriousness of conduct caught by the section. 
     
      
    53 Her Honour recognised that the offence did not involve penile–vaginal sexual intercourse which, on authority, was considered to be much more serious than many of the other forms of conduct encompassed by the definition of sexual intercourse in the legislation. However, as her Honour held, the digital penetration involved a gross invasion of the complainant’s physical integrity and an extreme breach of trust. The complainant’s young age at 11 or 12 was also a matter of significance. 
     
      
    54 Her Honour acknowledged that there was no physical violence or threat of physical violence beyond that involved in the act of penetration, and that the two offences could properly be regarded as the one continuing event without any element of pre-meditation. 
     
      
    55 Her Honour referred to the victim impact statement made by the complainant which was dated 17 July 2003. The reference was in a particular context. The following passage indicates the context. 
     
      
       
        
        It was submitted on behalf of the offender that although there were two sexual assaults they were isolated in that they occurred within a few minutes of each on one day only. It was further submitted that the conduct did not appear to be premeditated but rather was opportunistic and of very short duration. As well, the offender did not threaten or place pressure on [the complainant] at the time of the sexual assaults or afterwards and the actual penetration was to the slightest degree and was not accompanied by physical discomfort, damage or trauma. 
        
       
       
        
        With respect to the latter submission, I have regard to the victim impact statement provided by [the complainant] to the Court and dated 17 July 2003. That statement eloquently and articulately describes how the commission of these offences has affected this young girl. One matter which is of comment is that since this has happened to her she has tried to harm herself on three occasions, once with Panadol and twice by cutting her wrists. She said at the time, that seemed like the only way to stop the hurt. She said she has difficulty sleeping and experiences frequent nightmares about the abuse. Reliving the experience at the trial was extremely hard and it was also very difficult getting ready for court. Having regard to the content of the Victim Impact Statement I cannot accept the submission made on behalf of the offender that there was no trauma associated with this offence. 
        
       
      
    56 It is not apparent that her Honour gave weight to the complainant’s victim impact statement beyond a finding that the offence was not without some trauma to the complainant.  
     
      
    57 In her victim impact statement, the complainant spoke of the effect of the offences on her. She said that she became withdrawn and easily upset. She became anxious about male figures in her life, including members of her own family and, in particular, her father. She vomited after meals and became argumentative with friends and teachers. Her emotional state interfered with her schooling. She became concerned about her own worth. She had 15 sessions of counselling at fortnightly intervals but found reliving the experience upsetting. She was having difficulty sleeping and suffered from nightmares about the episode. The experience of the trial and the time leading up to the trial were distressing. She had tried to harm herself on three occasions, once with Panadol and twice by cutting her wrist, which she said seemed like the only way to stop the hurt. She had seen a psychologist on four occasions in addition to the counselling sessions and she thought she would continue with that. Before the appellant went into custody, she was worried that he would show up where she was when she was out. The complainant disclosed in the statement that she had received the assistance of a psychologist and the witness assistance officer in the preparation of the statement.  
     
      
    58 Harm to the victim of an offence is a relevant consideration. Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [95], Hall (NSW CCA, 28 September 1995, unreported). It is a factor in aggravation. As such, the court must be satisfied as to the facts beyond reasonable doubt. The common law is now codified by s21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    59 Her Honour would have had in mind the provisions of s28(1) of that Act which provides that, if it considers it appropriate to do so, a court may receive and consider a victim impact statement at any time after conviction but before sentence.  
     
      
    60 Section 28(4) provides that the court must not consider a victim impact statement unless it has been given by or on behalf of the victim to whom it relates or by or on behalf of the prosecutor, and must not consider a victim impact statement given by a family victim in connection with the determination of the punishment of the offender unless it considers that it is appropriate to do so. (A “family victim” is defined as meaning a member of the primary victim’s immediate family where the primary victim has died as a direct result of the offence.) The implication is that a victim impact statement may, in the discretion of a court, be received and taken into account as evidence of harm caused by the offence and, in that way, as evidence relevant to the determination of punishment by sentence.  
     
      
    61 Whilst a sentencing hearing is not subject to the rules of evidence unless an order to that effect is made and whilst s28 also, by implication, allows the court to take a victim impact statement into account in determining the appropriate punishment by sentence, the weight to be given to such a statement is for the court to determine. In RKB (NSW CCA, 30 June 1992, unreported) it was acknowledged that a sentencing court is required to take into account the impact of criminal behaviour on the victim or victims of such behaviour but, it was said, what is required is an objective assessment of the crime’s effect.  
     
      
    62 The court is required to be satisfied of the facts in question beyond reasonable doubt. In these circumstances, substantial weight cannot be given to an account of harm in an unsworn statement, not necessarily and almost certainly not in the victim’s own words, untested by cross-examination and, in the nature of things, far from being an objective and impartial account of the effect of the offence on the victim. 
     
      
    63 I would construe the trial judge’s remarks on sentence in relation to the victim impact statement as a finding of some emotional harm to the complainant, but not a finding as to the nature and extent of such harm in any particular respect. 
     
      
    64 Although the point is not one of special significance, I would mention that it is impermissible for a sentencing judge to treat the distress of the victim in having to give evidence as a matter of aggravation: Siganto (1998) 194 CLR 656 at [27]. I do not construe the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as modifying that approach. Although her Honour referred to that aspect of the victim impact statement in the present case, it does not appear that any significant importance was attached to that factor by her.  
     
      
    65 Her Honour found special circumstances on the basis that this was the first time the offender had served a custodial sentence, that it would be served in protective custody and that an extended period of supervision was appropriate. 
     
      
    66 The submissions made on appeal emphasised matters taken into account by the sentencing judge and to which I have referred. It was also observed that the degree of actual penetration was unspecified in the evidence and, accordingly, had to be assumed to have been to the slightest degree. That, it was said, is consistent with the absence of evidence of physical discomfort or physical injury. I do not doubt that her Honour was alert to that consideration. 
     
      
    67 This case is very far from the more serious instances of offending behaviour comprehended by the section, being a case of digital penetration and penetration which has to be assumed to have been to a slight degree. As against that, there is the age of the complainant and the relationship of trust. Notwithstanding those countervailing considerations, the sentences are, in my view, manifestly excessive having regard to the objective features of the offences to which I have referred. I would accordingly allow the appeal. 
     
      
    68 For the purposes of re-sentencing, the objective features of the case and the subjective considerations to be brought to account are clear from what I have written to this point. I would find special circumstances on the same grounds as were found by the sentencing judge. I would impose concurrent sentences of two years imprisonment with a non-parole period in each case of one year.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    69 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
       
      (2) Grant leave to appeal against sentence; 
       
       
      (3) Appeal against sentence allowed; 
       
       
      (4) Sentences quashed and, in lieu thereof, re-sentence on each count to a term of two years’ imprisonment, commencing on 26 June 2003, with a non-parole period of one year, commencing on 26 June 2003 and expiring on 25 June 2004; 
       
       
      (5) The appellant is to be released on parole at the end of the non-parole period.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Sperling J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Sides DCJ. The applicant had been committed for trial on 15 counts under s85A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, detaining with intent to obtain advantage. The maximum penalty for an offence under s85A(1) is fourteen years imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 When the matter was listed for trial on 3 February 2003, the Crown accepted a plea to three of the charges, with the 12 other matters of detaining with intent to obtain advantage and one matter of having custody of a knife at a school being taken into account on Form 1.  
     
      
    3 On 1 April 2003, the applicant was sentenced on one count, taking into account the Form 1 matters, to eight and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five and a half years. On each of the remaining two counts, the applicant was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years, all sentences to be served concurrently. In view of time in custody before trial, the sentences were dated to commence on 18 November 2002. The effective aggregate sentence was accordingly imprisonment for eight and a half years with a non-parole period of five and a half years.

    4 The applicant relies on the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) (a) His Honour erred in taking into account the objective seriousness of the offences when applying s22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and assessing the utilitarian value of the plea. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) His Honour erred in his assessment of the applicant’s contrition by: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) taking into account the objective seriousness of the offences, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) concluding that, because the applicant was prepared to accept legal advice in relation to his plea, he did not demonstrate any genuine remorse. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) His Honour gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The sentences are manifestly excessive, taking into account the pleas of guilty, the applicant’s mental illness, the fact the he will have to serve his sentences in protective custody, his prospects of rehabilitation, his prior good character and his subjective background. 
        
       
       
      Statement of facts and handwritten note 
       
      
    5 The facts of the episode giving rise to the charges were recorded in a statement of facts which was before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
       
        
        Throughout the later half of 2001 the prisoner Wayne Pearson was having a family law dispute with his defacto over access to their 12 month old daughter Skye. Family law proceedings at Goulburn court in December 2001 had been adjourned until February 2002 which resulted in a delay in access orders being made. The prisoner was subsequently devastated that he would not have access to his daughter for her first Christmas.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On the morning of 20 December 2001 the prisoner purchased a tube of glue and a Wiltshire knife in a sharpening holder from Woolworths at Miller shopping centre. He then attended a Caltex petrol station where he purchased a 5 litre petrol can which he filled with unleaded petrol. He placed these items in a black sports type bag which already contained a cigarette lighter and a pair of scissors. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In an effort to contact his defacto regarding the access dispute, the prisoner attended the nearby Miller High School where his defacto’s young brothers attended school as students. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        At the High School the prisoner was seen to be acting suspiciously. The principal, Mr David Horton, was informed and escorted him off the school grounds. Pearson then went to the nearby Miller primary school still carrying the black bag. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Shortly after 9am the victim Miss May Dare was teaching a class of 14 Year 5 students in a classroom at Miller public school. It was the last day of the school term. At about 10.15am the prisoner walked into the classroom where Miss Dare and her students were. This classroom was constructed of wood and was separate from the other buildings at the school and located on the edge of the school boundary. All the windows to the room were covered by heavy duty steel security bars. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Pearson placed the black bag on a table and he said to Miss Dare  
        “I want to see the principal”.  
         At this stage Miss Dare was not sure what was happening. She inquired whether she should send a student to the principal’s office and the prisoner stated  
        “yes”.  
         A student, Amne Alrifai, was despatched to the principal’s office.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The principal, Mark Myles, was advised by Amne Arifai that he was urgently required in Miss Dare’s classroom. Together with the assistant principal, Vicki Craze, he went to the classroom. The prisoner saw Mr Myles and he said to Miss Dare  
        “I don’t want to speak to him, I don’t like him.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner then barricaded the 2 doors to the classroom with a table and fridge and a book case. As he was doing this the prisoner was saying  
        “I just want to see my daughter, this is the only way they will listen”.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Myles immediately returned to his office and made arrangements for the Police to be notified. He returned to the classroom. Police arrived a short time afterwards and took up positions around the classroom out of sight. Fire Brigade, Ambulance and State Protection Group personnel and trained negotiators subsequently attended the school also. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The accused them removed the can of petrol from the bag and sat it on the floor. He stated  
        “I’m not going to hurt the kids.” 
         Miss Dare and the children had to remain in the classroom. Miss Dare yelled from a window  
        “He’s got petrol”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Myles noticed from the verandah window the can of petrol on the floor and saw the accused take the lid off the can. The prisoner then moved more furniture from the classroom in front of the doors to further barricade them. The children remaining in the room were screaming and panicking. Mr Myles then spoke to Pearson through a window on the verandah and requested he come to the rear window to talk. This window was situated at the opposite end of the classroom away from where the children were. The prisoner came to the window and Mr Myles stated  
        “What’s up”.  
         The prisoner was in an agitated state and replied “ 
        I just want my daughter. Get me a phone, I want a phone.” 
         Mr Myles arranged for a mobile phone to be brought immediately. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The children by this stage were terrified. A few children became hysterical and were physically sick. Mr Myles requested the prisoner release some of the children. Initially Pearson refused saying  
        “No, you’re just trying to get into the room and arrest me.” 
         After being assured by Mr Myles this would not occur, the prisoner gradually permitted the most hysterical children to leave. These students were Kirsty McLennan, Kiera Ellis, Samya Abouschmiess, Monique Osgood and Karen Henry. Karen Henry suffers from an intellectual handicap and was particularly distressed. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Myles continued talking with Pearson through the window in an effort to calm him down. He demanded to speak on the phone with his solicitor who was dealing with the family law matter. Pearson had difficulty having the solicitor respond to his phone call. He said to Mr Myles 
         “Okay, tell em I’ve got kids in here and a can of petrol and Police all around the building. I want to speak to my solicitor.  
        Mr Myles then took the phone and attempted to contact the solicitor and explain the predicament he was in. However the solicitor’s office did not take his call seriously and could not assist.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Myles then requested the prisoner release more of the children because it was hot and they were scared. He replied  
        “Don’t worry, I don’t want to hurt the kids. I’’ll kill myself before I kill them. I’ve got petrol over my clothes and skin.”  
        He then offered to buy the children drinks and passed a $10.00 note to Mr Myles saying  
        “I’m holding them here, I’ll buy them some drinks and show them that I don’t really want to hurt them.” 
          
        
       
       
        
        Mr Myles then left the verandah and walked towards Inspector Colin Patemen who was the Officer in Charge at the scene. Pearson called out to Mr Myles  
        “You make sure you come back and tell them if they do anything stupid they’ll be sorry.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Mr Myles then approached Inspector Patemen. It was decided that as Mr Myles was making good progress with the prisoner then he should continue in the role of negotiator. The drinks arrived and Mr Myles took them to the window. He said to the prisoner  
        “The Police asked if you want to talk to them.”  
        He replied  
        “Get some negotiators here.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Inspector Pateman spoke to the prisoner on the mobile phone and it was agreed he could approach. He walked onto the verandah of the class room and spoke with the prisoner through the window. Mr Myles remained at the window also. Pearson was still in a distressed state and said to the Inspector  
        “I’ve got petrol, don’t do anything stupid, don’t come in here or I’ll light myself.”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Inspector Patemen then questioned Pearson as to his reasons for his behaviour and he replied  
        “I want to talk to a negotiator, I want to see my daughter. I want to see my daughter here now.”  
        Inspector Pateman then told the prisoner to calm down before leaving the verandah for a short time to update the State Protection Group of the situation and the prisoner’s demands. The Inspector returned to the verandah and observed the prisoner to be holding an orange coloured cigarette lighter in his right hand. The Inspector spoke at length with Pearson about his family law dispute. During this conversation the prisoner’s moods would change dramatically. At times he would appear rational and in control and at other times he became distressed and agitated. At the end of this conversation the Inspector again left the verandah area and updated other Police and Emergency personnel on the situation. Contingency plans were made to force an entry to the classroom in the event of an emergency. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Inspector Pateman returned to the verandah and continued his conversation with the prisoner. During this conversation the prisoner removed a piece of paper from his pocket and appeared to read from the document. He renewed his demand for his daughter to be brought to him. He said  
        “I want my daughter here now, I want her at the window now.”  
        The Inspector made it clear to the prisoner that under no circumstances could his young daughter be brought to the scene. The prisoner again became upset. Pearson then stated he wanted to buy the children some lunch and handed Mr Myles a further $10.00 note for the purchase of some McDonalds. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        After further discussions and negotiation Inspector Pateman was eventually able to have the prisoner agree to leave the classroom on the condition that a Police car be brought to the area just outside the classroom and he and the Inspector travel alone to the Police Station to further discuss his problems. The prisoner then passed through the window to the Inspector a jumper containing an object wrapped inside. The prisoner said  
        “Don’t worry. It’s not a gun it’s only a knife. I was going to cut my wrists with it.”  
        The Inspector left the verandah and passed the jumper and knife to other Police waiting nearby out of sight. He then returned to the verandah and had a further brief conversation with the prisoner. A marked Police vehicle was driven to a position outside the classroom. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner then commenced to remove furniture from a door. The door then opened and Pearson walked out onto the verandah. The time was 11.26am. The siege of the classroom and the detention of the teacher and students had lasted about one hour and ten minutes. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Inspector Pateman removed the cigarette lighter from Pearson’s hand. Other Police then arrested and handcuffed Pearson and escorted him to the Police vehicle.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Other Police then entered the classroom and checked on the welfare of Miss Dare and the remaining children. The petrol can and black bag were retrieved. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner was taken to Green Valley Police Station. At 12.53 pm that day he was formally interviewed on video tape by Detectives Gary Miller and Christie Moran.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He admitted to going to the class room (Q28) and to barricading the doors. (Q43) 
        
       
       
        
        He gave a detailed account of his family law dispute. (Q69-72) 
        
       
       
        
        He agreed that he had written on the piece of paper he had in the classroom a list of the problems he was having at the time (Q86-89)  
        
       
       
        
        He admitted to purchasing the petrol can and petrol and the knife that morning. (Q90-98) 
        
       
       
        
        He stated that what he hoped to gain from going to the classroom and keeping the children and teacher there was for someone to listen to him for once. (Q135) 
        
       
       
        
        After the event Miss Dare and each of the children received formal trauma counselling for four to six weeks. Some children required continued counselling for some months. Reshana Carney continues with counselling to this date.  
        
       
      
    6 The document which the applicant removed from his pocket and appeared to read while in conversation with Inspector Pateman was a handwritten note. It was in evidence before his Honour, with a typescript as follows.

    7 His Honour found the facts relating to the episode in accordance with the statement of facts and the note to which I have referred.  
     
      
       
      Further findings of fact by the trial judge 
       
      
    8 His Honour went on to find, in accordance with the evidence before him, that counselling was provided to the children, one of whom continued to receive counselling, at least until February 2003. There were other repercussions. The parents of the children were contacted and came to the school during the episode. So did Ms Dare’s partner. Her victim impact statement indicated that the episode had had a seriously deleterious effect on her life.  
     
      
    9 His Honour reviewed the appellant’s personal history up to the time of the subject offences: 
     
      
       
        
        The Offender was born in Wollongong on 1 August 1976. He was twenty five at the time of the offence. He is now twenty six. He was apparently raised in the Mt Druitt area. He has an older brother and two older sisters. These children were from his mother’s first relationship. He has an older sister who is a full sibling. She is the only survivor of triplets. His parents separated when the Offender was aged about two. Shortly after that, his mother entered into a relationship with the Offender’s step-father who had three boys by a previous relationship. The Offender has had very little contact with his natural father. According to the evidence, he views his step-father as his real father.  
        
       
       
        
        There were about seven children in the household when the Offender was growing up. He claims that discipline was maintained through strict corporal punishment. The history he gave indicates that he hated primary school. He reported to Dr Reznic that he had few friends outside his sporting interests. He said that he frequently became involved in fights at school and was suspended on at least two occasions. On one occasion when he felt that a teacher had falsely accused him, he responded by bailing the teacher up. He left school without obtaining his school certificate. The accounts of his age at that time vary from fourteen to sixteen.  
        
       
       
        
        I note that he told Dr Reznic that he was prescribed spectacles when he was in Year 5 at school but did not wear them because he was teased by other people. He has a limited capacity to read or write. After he left school, he worked as a stable hand for two years and then worked on a dairy for a period of time. He claims that he would work up to 100 hours per week on the dairy. In February 1998 he secured a job as a storeman. He held this position until April 2001 when he succumbed to viral meningitis. He has not worked since then. 
        
       
       
        
        The Offender entered into a relationship in 1998. As I have indicated there is a daughter to that relation born in January 2001. They separated in June 2001.  
        
       
       
        
        The Offender commenced to consume liquor and cannabis on a regular basis at an early age. The accounts he gave as to the age of starting such conduct varied. He told Dr Reznic that he would consume between thirty and forty cones of cannabis a day. I note that he has no convictions connected with his use of liquor or drugs, such as PCA type offences. 
        
       
       
        
        In August/September 2000 the Offender and his partner moved from Sydney to Goulburn so that she could be closer to her mother during her pregnancy. The Offender continued to work in Sydney commuting each day. This would involve daily commuting of somewhere between three and four hours. This placed a lot of pressure on the relationship and led to conflicts between the Offender and his partner and between the Offender and his mother-in-law. In his view, his mother-in-law was interfering in his relationship with his partner. The tension and conflict led to him consuming greater quantities of liquor and cannabis. 
        
       
       
        
        In about November 2000, the Offender witnessed a terrible motor vehicle accident whilst commuting to work. During it, two people were killed when a motor vehicle burst into flames and they could not be rescued. Afterwards, according to the opinion of Dr Reznic, he experienced symptoms consistent with post traumatic stress disorder. These symptoms included difficulty in sleeping, nightmares, irritability, problems with co-workers and his wife. He did not receive any treatment for his condition at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        The birth of his daughter in January 2001 added to the difficulties in his life because of the loss of sleep with a young child in the household. Conflicts within the relationship and with his mother-in-law increased. The Offender responded to these by increasing his intake of liquor and cannabis. In about April of that year, he was admitted to Goulburn Hospital physically exhausted. Apparently he was diagnosed as suffering from viral meningitis the symptoms being a stiff neck, blurred vision, vomiting and complete lack of energy.  
        
       
       
        
        The Offender was unable to work after his hospitalisation. Financial difficulties arising because of his inability to work added to domestic conflict and the Offender’s feelings of inadequacy. By June 2001 the relationship had broken down. By this time, he was exhibiting significant signs of a depressive disorder. He was irritable and agitated because of the lack of sleep. The Offender lacked energy and felt guilty most of the time and had problems concentrating. Towards the end of June, he assaulted his partner after an argument. Ultimately he was given a section 9 bond for that matter. It was current at the time of the commission of these offences. That is an aggravating feature. 
        
       
       
        
        During the course of the commission of that offence, he would not let the police enter the house where he was with the baby. After his release to bail, he spent two or three weeks in a Goulburn psychiatric hospital. He believes that he was diagnosed as having Schizophrenia and he claims that he was given medication for it. There is no evidence from the Goulburn psychiatric hospital concerning his admission, diagnosis or treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        The Offender told Dr Reznic that he ceased taking his medication about two months after on the advice of a local doctor. There is no evidence from that local doctor. This account conflicts with the account provided by the Offender in the ERISP, an account much more contemporaneous with the events. In the ERISP he said that he ceased medication about two weeks earlier because he did not want help any more (Q & A 143). 
        
       
       
        
        After the assault at the end of June, an AVO was taken out to protect his partner. After the Offender was discharged from Goulburn Hospital, he moved to Sydney and lived with his mother and step-father. During the ensuing months, he found it difficult to have access to his daughter notwithstanding court orders. It is his belief that his former partner was deliberately frustrating his daughter’s rights to have access to him. Out of frustration, he attempted to cut his wrists on at least one occasion. Whether this was in October or around 15 December is unclear. It is of course possible that there were two such attempts. The histories vary. He makes reference to admissions to Blacktown and Westmead Hospitals. He claims that there was no follow up. He also claimed that he had no where to live at the time of his arrest. It is unclear when he ceased to live with his mother and step-father. The Offender became very distressed as a consequence of the cancellation of court orders entitling his daughter to have access to him just before the Christmas/New Year period. These offences were committed shortly after that, on 20 December.  
        
       
      
    10 His Honour made further reference to the cessation of medication, later in the summing up. 
     
      
       
        
        When he became frustrated because of the developments in the Family Court case it seems that he ceased his medication. I am not prepared to accept his assertion to Dr Reznic that he ceased it on medical advice.  
        
       
      
    11 His Honour reviewed the medical evidence. 
     
      
       
        
        There is no reliable evidence that he was intoxicated at the time of the commission of the offence. He may have consumed liquor or drugs on the previous evening but I am not persuaded upon the evidence before me that they had any part to play in the commission of these offences. I note that his excessive consumption of liquor in the past had not led to him being involved in criminal activity or breaches of the law, such as drink driving. 
        
       
       
        
        The Offender was seen by Dr Read a psychiatrist in Silverwater Remand Centre on 23 December 2001. Dr Reznic saw him on 15 February 2002. I accept the opinions of Drs Reznic and Westmore. I accept that, at the time of the offences, the Offender was suffering a major depressive illness. It is also probable that he might have had residual symptoms of post traumatic distress disorder. 
        
       
       
        
        Dr Westmore expressed the following opinion, that at the time of the offences:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “He had a disturbed mood state, a significant disturbance in his biological functions, suicidal thoughts and self harming behaviours. His depression arose in the context of the break down in his family relationships, in particular the separation from his daughter.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          There was no evidence in his history or documents available about him to indicate that he has suffering from a psychotic condition at the time of the incident and while he was suffering from a mental illness, it is my opinion that he would have been aware of the nature and quality of his actions and he would have had some understanding that his actions were wrong. This latter opinion is supported by his repeated statements that he did not intend to harm any of the children and his other behaviours of concealing the knife from the children and releasing some of the children from the class room after they had demonstrated distress. He does not, therefore, in my opinion have a mental illness defence available to him.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Court however might consider by way of mitigation the nature and severity of this man’s psychiatric problems at the time this incident occurred. The extreme nature of his alleged offending behaviour appears to be quite inconsistent with his autobiographical history and his personality structure. This man does not for example have an anti social personality disorder. While his behaviour has a multi dimensioned aetiology, the role of his major depression in his apparent behaviour was, in my opinion, significant”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The Offender has been treated with appropriate medication, psychiatric care and counselling since the offence. He has insight into the fact that he has been psychiatrically unwell and remains so. He has received counselling in connection with his abuse of cannabis and liquor. He asserts that he has remained abstinent from these two substances since the offences.  
        
       
       
        
        I note Dr Westmore’s opinion that, notwithstanding the treatment he received since the offence, the Offender’s depressive illness was only in partial remission. Dr Westmore saw the Offender on 13 January 2003. His opinion is consistent with the contents set out in the document from Hunter Health (exhibit 5) dated 23 October 2002. Dr Spruce is his most recent treating doctor. In his report of 24 March 2003 he expresses the view that the Offender’s condition is now controlled by medication. Dr Westmore’s opinion demonstrates that the Offender’s depression has only come under control in relatively recent times.  
        
       
       
      Other evidence available at sentencing hearing concerning the applicant’s mental condition 
       
      
    12 In addition to the evidence mentioned by his Honour, there was other evidence bearing upon the applicant’s mental state before and at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    13 Confining myself to the materials before his Honour, there were patent signs of emotional disturbance at the time of the episode involving the prior assault which occurred on 23 June 2001, some six months before the episode giving rise to the subject offences. At that time, the applicant, his partner and the child, were living at Goulburn. The police statement of facts in relation to that episode includes a record that, as observed by the police, the defendant, while holding the baby, went into fits of rage, smashing his head and fist against doors and walls, and that this happened several times. Other conduct by the applicant on that occasion further indicated the applicant’s disturbed state of mind. He told the police that he was on medication following the earlier hospitalisation for viral meningitis which, according to the applicant, made him feel schizophrenic and unable to control his temper. He told the police that he had suicidal thoughts and had tried to kill himself by taking three teaspoons of coffee which he thought would kill him due to the medication he was taking. Whilst in the dock in the police station he began to hyperventilate. Ambulance officers were called to treat him. He was bailed on that occasion subject to conditions which included that he attend the Chisholm Ross Centre at Goulburn, which is a psychiatric unit. He was then hospitalised, either there or in some other psychiatric hospital, for two to three weeks and was discharged on medication. The applicant separated from his partner at that time and moved to live in Sydney. It was in these circumstances that disputation arose concerning access to the child.  
     
      
    14 There was evidence that, at some time between the June 2001 and December 2001 episodes (subsequent information shows that it was on 2 November 2001), the applicant was admitted to hospital after cutting his wrist. Early in December, the proceedings to do with access to the child were adjourned until February 2002. Precisely what orders were made on that occasion is not known but it was the applicant’s perception that he would be denied access to his daughter until at least February, missing out on her first birthday and on seeing her at Christmas. 
     
      
    15 The note written by the plaintiff on the night before the December episode indicates that the applicant had formulated a plan to do something of the kind that occurred next day. That is apparent from the reference to a police negotiator, school children and a high school. It is also apparent that, at that time, the applicant was subject to a degree of suicidal ideation, saying in the note that he was in depression and did not care if he died or other people did. The applicant told the police in his ERISP interview that he had bought the epoxy glue and the paring knife intending to superglue his mouth shut, pour petrol over himself, light himself and cut his wrists at the same time (Q94-98). There does not seem to be any other explanation for having bought the glue and the knife. This was further evidence of suicidal ideation.  
     
      
    16 As for the episode of 20 December 2001 itself, the applicant’s conduct was bizarre from the start. According to the teacher, Ms Dare, the applicant asked to speak to the school principal. Then when he saw the principal and deputy principal walking towards the classroom, the applicant said he did not want to speak to him, adding “I don’t like him”. There is nothing to suggest that the school principal, Mr Myles, was previously known to the applicant to account for that sentiment. The applicant then proceeded to barricade the door of the classroom, saying that he just wanted to see his daughter and that this was the only way that they would listen. Later, the applicant explicitly demanded that his daughter be brought to the school for him to see. This behaviour was irrational in the extreme. What benefit could the applicant possibly have obtained from his daughter being brought to the school for him to see? What kind of pleasure could he hope to obtain from seeing the child in those circumstances? As for the longer term, how could his conduct be anything but counter-productive in resolving the dispute over access to the child satisfactorily? The applicant’s conduct was consistent only with a state of substantial mental disturbance. 
     
      
    17 The applicant was taken into custody. According to the evidence, he was examined by Dr Reid, a psychiatrist, at Silverwater Remand Centre. There was, unfortunately, no report before his Honour concerning that examination and, indeed, nothing relating to psychiatric assessment earlier than mid-February 2002. His Honour had a report of Dr R Reznik, a forensic psychiatric registrar at the Long Bay Correctional Complex, who examined the applicant on 15 February 2002. His opinion, as recorded in his report of 20 February 2002, includes a retrospective assessment. 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Pearson continues to present with Major Depressive Disorder and residual symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. In this sense, he continues to manifest a major disorder of mood. At the material time of the alleged offence, he was experiencing a similar constellation of symptoms, which I believe contributed to his behaviour at the material time of the alleged offences. He also continues to manifest a high degree of stress and preoccupation in regard with his familial situation. In my view, he would likely meet the terms of the Mental Health Act and can be regarded as a “mentally ill person” under that Act requiring further psychiatric treatment. 
        
       
      
    18 There was no reason to suppose that the applicant’s mental state on 20 December 2001 had been any different from his state in mid-February 2002. The evidence of suicidal ideation and irrational behaviour at that time indicates strongly that it was not.  
     
      
    19 The reference to post traumatic stress disorder in Dr Reznik’s related to an incident in November 2001, recorded earlier in Dr Reznik’s report, when the applicant had witnessed a motor accident in which two individuals were burnt to death before his eyes. He had watched helplessly as these persons were consumed in a fireball. Thereafter, he had experienced a number of symptoms consistent with post traumatic stress disorder but had received no treatment for that condition.  
     
      
    20 After being released from custody on bail in May 2002, the diagnosis of major depressive disorder was confirmed by others, medication was prescribed and the applicant was kept under review. 
     
      
       
      Trial judge’s assessment of the applicant’s mental condition 
       
      
    21 His Honour’s assessment of the applicant’s mental state at the time of the subject offences and of the applicant’s criminal responsibility in relation to those offences is apparent from the following extract from the remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        I agree with Dr Westmore that the Offender was aware of the nature and quality of his acts and had some understanding that what he was doing was wrong. In my view this is demonstrated by a number of things. Amongst others they are:  
        
       
      
    · that he said that he did not want to hurt the children;  
     
      
    · he indicated in the ERISP interview that he did not want the children to see the knife;  
     
      
    · when the inspector suggested that they go to the police station to talk the Offender said: “How can I? Look what I have done”; and  
     
      
    · the content of question and answer 101 in the ERISP interview. Having indicated that none of the children had seen the knife, he continued with his account without any further question being asked. Answer 101 is recorded in the transcript: “Cause I was in a way concerned about them too if I like if I did lose total control that’s why I kept saying I’m not going to hurt em, I’m not going to hurt em”.  
     
      
       
        
        That part of his answer demonstrates that he was in control, conscious of the possibility of losing total control and the consequences should that occur.  
        
       
       
        
        I must consider each offence separately. Each is a serious crime. In my view, the offences were executed in a fashion that demonstrated some thought being put into the matter. Not only had he purchased petrol and a knife, but, in my view, he selected his target in a fashion to maximise his chances of securing his demands. He knew his victims were vulnerable and the authorities would deal with the matter with great sensitivity because of the implications if they did otherwise. I have already mentioned my view that he showed some consideration for his victims in order to improve his negotiating position. He was conscious that he was causing emotional distress to his very young victims. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, it is impossible for him not to have had some appreciation of the distress that he caused to the teacher. He must have realised that she would have felt responsible for the safety of the children. All but five children were held for just over an hour. It is unclear how long the other five were held. Their distress was more overt than that of the rest of the children. As I have observed one of them was intellectually disabled. In my view, the fear and terror occasioned to all detainees was great. The victims, the children that is, were entitled to feel safe in their class room. The teacher felt responsible for their safety. The placing of the can of petrol on the floor and the removal of the lid was designed to instil fear into the children and the teacher to ensure that they would not offer any opposition to him. It is clear that these acts had the desired effect upon all of the victims. Question and answer 101 shows that he was in control and he wanted to maintain that position. 
        
       
       
        
        I cannot accept the account that he gave in the interview that he was on his way to commit suicide in a house that he and his partner had previously occupied when he just happened to end up in the class room at that school. I am satisfied on all the evidence and satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence was premeditated. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, the purposes for the detention were threefold.  
        
       
       
        
        1. to see his daughter;  
        
       
       
        
        2. to have somebody listen to his grievances about the family court proceedings and his inability to have access to his daughter; and  
        
       
       
        
        3. to get the attention of his solicitor. 
        
       
      
    22 Later in the remarks on sentence, his Honour returned to the question of the applicant’s mental state at the time of the offences.  
     
      
       
        
        The Court is troubled by the weight to be given to his disability, that is the mental illness, that was in existence at the time and the weight to be given to deterrence in light of that disability. However, as I have noted, he was aware of the nature and quality of his acts and had some appreciation that what he was doing was wrong. As I have indicated, his answer to question 101 shows that he was aware of the need for him to retain control of the situation and the consequences if he did not do so. On all the evidence, I am satisfied that, for the most part during the events the subject of the siege, that he did remain in control and that when he had felt that he had achieved the one remaining purpose that it was likely he could achieve (that is to have somebody listen to his grievances) he left the room. In those circumstances, in my view, it is appropriate that considerable weight be given to deterrence, not the same amount of weight to be given in the case of an individual who is without any disability, but nonetheless, it should be considerable. 
        
       
       
      Fresh evidence concerning the applicant’s mental condition 
       
      
    23 More is now known about an important aspect of the applicant’s medical history. As I have noted, his Honour was not satisfied that the applicant was advised to cease taking medication. His Honour attributed that to the applicant’s frustration with the Family Court proceedings. That view of the facts was open to his Honour on the evidence before him. However, fresh evidence admitted on appeal, without objection, indicates that the relevant facts in that regard are as follows. 
     
      
    24 The applicant was discharged from Goulburn hospital following the incident in June 2001. He was prescribed Largactil and Valium at that time. Subsequently, on 2 November 2001, he went to a police station, asking for help. (This also appears to be the episode on which the applicant presented with a cut wrist.) He was taken to Blacktown Hospital, a transit station for patients en route to Cumberland Hospital, which is part of the Westmead Hospital complex. At Blacktown Hospital, the applicant was scheduled but, on transfer to Cumberland Hospital, he was discharged the same day into his own care, with instructions to cease medication. It was about six weeks later that the subject offences were committed. All this was patently clear from records tendered on the hearing of the appeal.  
     
      
    25 The references to Blacktown and Westmead Hospitals now made sense. More importantly, it was now established that the applicant had indeed ceased to take medication on medical advice. And that there was “no follow-up”, as the applicant put it. He then continued without medication and without treatment for his mental condition until the offences were committed in December 2001. 
     
      
       
      Further matters taken into account by the trial judge 
       
      
    26 His Honour had regard to the considerations specified in s21A. He found that the applicant had threatened to use a weapon, taking the view that the petrol qualified in that regard. The applicant was found to be of good character in relative terms having regard to the one prior offence (the assault committed on 23 June 2001). His Honour said that the likelihood of re-offending was difficult to assess. That, his Honour found, appeared to depend on the applicant’s response to frustration, compliance with his medication regime and the relationship between the two. 
     
      
    27 A new light was now cast on the last of these considerations by the additional evidence. There is now no reason to suppose that the applicant might cease medication without advice, whether as a frustration response or otherwise. 
     
      
    28 His Honour allowed a discount of 15 per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea of guilty. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        The plea of guilty was entered on the morning that the matter was fixed for trial. That trial was to have been for 15 counts of detain for advantage. The Offender pleaded guilty to three counts with the balance of the charges being taken into account on the schedule. Prior to the date of the plea of guilty, the Crown had indicated (prior to the date of arraignment that is 25 October 2002), that it would accept pleas of guilty to three counts with the balance being taken into account on a schedule. On the face of it, this is a case where the plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest opportunity. However, he was originally charged with false imprisonment. There was considerable delay before the committal proceedings were held, whilst the DPP considered whether that or some alternative charge provided for in the legislation would be appropriate. Ultimately, the decision was to proceed with a charge covered by legislation rather than the common law. Mr O’Mullane, who appears on behalf of the Offender, indicates that he had early instructions to plead guilty to counts of false imprisonment. The matter proceeded in the Local Court by way of paper committal without the calling of witnesses. Upon Mr O’Mullane’s advice the pleas of not guilty were entered at arraignment pending further negotiations and investigations of issues such as the fitness to plead. 
        
       
       
        
        This case provides a complex history so far as an assessment of the leniency to be extended based upon the utility of the pleas of guilty. For reasons that will become apparent in due course, I have come to the view that nothing other than a full time custodial sentence is appropriate to reflect the objective seriousness of these offences. In applying s22 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         the Court is required to take into account the need to reflect the objective seriousness of the crime, or in this case, the crimes. Having considered all of those matters, I am of the view that he is entitled to a fifteen per cent reduction in the length of the full time custodial sentence to reflect the utility of the pleas of guilty. 
        
       
      
    29 Concerning contrition, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        In relation to each count, in my view, the Crown case against the Offender is an overwhelming one. However, that is not the only matter to be considered on the question of contrition. Admissions were made to police in the course of an interview conducted shortly after the offence came to an end. The victims and witnesses were relieved of anxiety of giving evidence during a trial. I take into account that he did instruct his counsel at an early stage that he would plead guilty to false imprisonment offences. By the same token, he was prepared to accept advice of his counsel in deferring the entry of the pleas of guilty after it became apparent at arraignment the DPP would proceed on the statutory charges. It is difficult, in these circumstances, to see any genuine remorse beyond that indicated by the admissions and the relief of anxiety to the victims and witnesses from having to give evidence in the course of the trial. 
        
       
       
        
        I have carefully looked at all the evidence placed before the Court and I have been unable to find any evidence of expressions of remorse on the part of the Offender. Apart from the matters that I have already enumerated, I have been unable to find any indicators of genuine remorse either.  
        
       
      
    30 His Honour went on to refer to the applicant’s conduct at the time of the offences and detected no evidence of remorse by the applicant from one moment to the next in the course of the episode. 
     
      
    31 His Honour found special circumstances on the basis that the applicant would serve his sentence in protective custody which was likely to curtail access to rehabilitation, educational, psychiatric and psychological services, and that this was the applicant’s first custodial sentence.  
     
      
    32 The finding that the applicant would serve his sentence in protective custody was a mistake. There remains, however, the fact that this was to be the applicant’s first custodial sentence. It would also be reasonable to take into account as a special circumstance that incarceration is likely to be more onerous for the plaintiff than for the general run of prison inmates by reason of his mental illness.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1(a): His Honour erred in taking into account the objective seriousness of the offences when applying s22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and assessing the utilitarian value of the plea. 
       
      
    33 His Honour misapplied s22. The seriousness of the offence is not relevant to the assessment of the utilitarian value of the plea. That vitiates his Honour’s determination of the discount to be allowed.  
     
      
    34 I would allow a discount of 22.5 per cent, having regard to the exigencies otherwise mentioned by his Honour, to the nature and the volume of the evidence which would have been called if the case had gone to trial. 
     
      
    35 This ground of appeal is made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(b): His Honour erred in his assessment of the applicant’s contrition by: 
       
       
      (i) taking into account the objective seriousness of the offences, 
       
      (ii) concluding that, because the applicant was prepared to accept legal advice in relation to his plea, he did not demonstrate any genuine remorse. 
       
      
    36 As to ground 1(b)(i), it was the overwhelming nature of the Crown case (that is, ease of proof), not the seriousness of the offences, which his Honour referred to as weighing against an inference of contrition from the pleas of guilty. That was not erroneous in legal principle. It was a legitimate consideration that, in pleading guilty, the applicant was merely bowing to the inevitable without other motivation. 
     
      
    37 This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    38 As to ground 1(b)(ii), it is the fact, as his Honour said, that the only potential evidence of contrition consisted of the pleas of guilty and admissions made by the applicant. But it was wrong to give less weight – perhaps it was no weight at all – to the pleas of guilty because they were delayed on legal advice, having regard to circumstances more fully set out by his Honour in relation to the discount allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas.  
     
      
    39 This ground is made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: His Honour gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s mental illness. 
       
       
      Ground 3: The sentences are manifestly excessive, taking into account the pleas of guilty, the applicant’s mental illness, the fact that he will have to serve his sentences in protective custody, his prospects of rehabilitation, his prior good character and his subjective background. 
       
      
    40 As I have mentioned, the reference to protective custody is acknowledged to be an error. 
     
      
    41 A fresh view has now to be taken of the significance of the applicant’s mental illness having regard to the evidence admitted on appeal. 
     
      
    42 It is first necessary, however, to state the correct approach to this topic. Mental illness in a case such as the present may be relevant, principally, in two ways. First, it may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: Pearce (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported); Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Letteri (NSW CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported). 
     
      
    43 Secondly, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced, there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced: Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [254], Jiminez [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23], Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400 and Lauritsen (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [51]. 
     
      
    44 The inapplicability of the M’Naghten rules relating to the defence of mental illness is not in point. It may be noted that, in his report, Dr Westmore did not merely exclude the defence of mental illness, he went on to say that the role of the applicant’s mental illness in his behaviour on the day was, in his opinion, significant. He correctly suggested that this was relevant to mitigation of penalty. Dr Westmore’s opinion in that regard was amply supported by the evidence to which I have referred. 
     
      
    45 Although his Honour noted Dr Westmore’s opinion with apparent acceptance, it does not appear that his Honour took the applicant’s mental illness into account in that way.  
     
      
    46 His Honour imposed an effective aggregate sentence of eight and a half years with a non-parole period of five and a half years. That was after a 15 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. So his Honour’s starting point was a head sentence of ten years, for which a non-parole period in the same proportion as that fixed would be six and a half years. 
     
      
    47 Giving due weight to the objective circumstances of the offences and other relevant considerations, that was, on the evidence before his Honour, manifestly excessive, having regard to the applicant’s mental illness and its significance in moderation of general deterrence and in moderation of denunciation and punishment. 
     
      
    48 The additional evidence admitted on appeal renders the substitution of a lesser sentence the more necessary. 
     
      
    49 Grounds 2 and 3 are accordingly made out. 
     
      
       
      Appeal allowed 
       
      
    50 Grounds 1(a), 1(b)(ii), 2 and 3 being upheld, the appeal should be allowed. 
     
      
       
      Re-sentencing 
       
      
    51 I adopt the findings of the trial judge with the modifications and additions to which I have referred, including the finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    52 Having regard to the objective and subjective considerations which are then to be taken into account and allowing a discount of 22.5 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas, the sentence should be imprisonment for a term of five years with a non-parole period of three years. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    53 I propose the following orders. 
     
      
       
      (1) Grant leave to appeal; 
       
       
      (2) Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      (3) Sentence quashed, and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for five years commencing on 18 November 2002, with a non-parole period of three years commencing on 18 November 2002 and expiring on 17 November 2005, that being the earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: This is a Crown appeal under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed upon the Respondent by his Honour Judge Phelan for an offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s61J of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstances of aggravation were that the Respondent did maliciously inflict actual bodily harm on the victim. 
     
      
    2 His Honour imposed a sentence of two years with a non-parole period of six months. The maximum sentence is twenty years. The “standard non-parole period” under s54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, is ten years. 
     
      
    3 The events occurred in the early hours of Monday 19 May 2003 at the Respondent’s home. The victim was a former girlfriend, with whom he had had a long term relationship which, after an interruption, had then recently resumed. 
     
      
    4 The victim was subjected to a course of violence at the hands of the Respondent. He picked her up and carried her into the lounge room and threw her against the lounge. He hit her across the face. He told her to take her pants off and threatened “If you don’t do it I’m going to hit you again”. The victim undid the tie of her pants. The Respondent pulled her pants off and forced her to the ground saying “This is what happens if you don’t do what I tell you”. He told her to open her legs and then inserted a cigar wrapped in plastic into her vagina. He forced her to pose for him whilst he took sexually explicit photos of her. He dressed her in his suit coat, Akubra hat and draped a Eureka Stockade flag over her. He hit her a number of times. He picked up an empty wine bottle. She ran to the door which the Respondent had locked. He threw the bottle at her. He took a hammer and rubbed the outside of her legs with the claw and then put the hammer between her legs.  
     
      
    5 His Honour referred to a litany of bizarre behaviour by the Respondent: 
     
      
    · speaking to the victim in what she described as “riddles … words that didn’t make sense to me at all”. 
     
      
    · making the victim lick coffee from the wall. 
     
      
    · dressing up the victim in a flag and ordering her to pose in different positions. 
     
      
    · forcing her to drink detergent. 
     
      
    · placing a knight from a chessboard on her mouth and other chess pieces on her hands and asking her to balance the pieces. 
     
      
    6 A neighbour came to the unit and saw the Respondent holding the victim’s arms behind her back. She called the police. The police arrived and entered the premises. They took the victim to Tweed Heads Hospital. The cigar was removed from deep inside her vagina. 
     
      
    7 As a result of the offence the victim suffered bruises, grazes and contusions. Her right eye was so swollen that it caused the closure of the eye. A medical report outlined the significant extent of the injuries she suffered. The offence was degrading and humiliating to the victim. The insertion of an object into her vagina, which had to be medically removed, was particularly detestable. A Victim Impact Statement indicated the significant effect which the incident had upon the victim, both physically and emotionally. She was unable to continue to work, her university studies were affected, as was her social life, particularly her ability to develop a close relationship.  
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge described the offence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The objective circumstances … remain very serious and must have been extremely frightening to the victim.” 
        
       
      
    9 Nevertheless his Honour imposed a two year sentence with a non-parole period of six months. The reason for imposing so light a sentence, given the objective seriousness of the events, was the mental condition of the Respondent. 
     
      
    10 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted that the Respondent had no criminal record of any significance. Furthermore he noted the victim herself asserted that the conduct of the Respondent on the day in question was completely out of character. She said in her victim impact statement: “Luke Hopkins had never been physically or sexually violent towards me before”. A number of aspects of her statement indicated the irrationality of the Respondent’s conduct on the day in question. 
     
      
    11 The Respondent had been involved in a severe motor vehicle accident in 1994. He had a period of three months of unconsciousness and thereafter a lengthy period of hospitalisation, which included treatment with psychotic drugs for his condition.  
     
      
    12 His Honour set out his findings on the Respondent’s mental health history as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Northern Rivers Area Health Service has recorded him as a patient since July 1996, when he was referred by his mother who was concerned by his aggressive and threatening behaviour. He was diagnosed as having attention deficit syndrome and a hyperactivity disorder which was treated with Ritalin until aged sixteen. He was first seen by Doctor Braganza, a psychiatrist, on 19 January 2001 with a history of changed behaviour since a motor vehicle accident. His mother described him as more erratic, depressed, and, to use her word, apparently psychotic. He had had six weeks of depression, he was teary and withdrawn and felt life was not worth living. The history given that he had had a temper prior to the motor vehicle accident but it was worse after, and also he was inclined to forgetfulness and could not concentrate. He was put on anti-depressant medication but was not compliant. On 28 March 2001, his mother had complained about him talking about things that made no sense and talking to himself. The doctor concluded it was evidence that he was harbouring a psychosis but that the exact nature of the latter was difficult to assess. He describes him a week later as being paranoid. On 30 March he was seen by the acute care team emergency and referred again to Doctor Braganza. He was admitted to the Richmond Clinic following increased paranoid delusions, for example, that he had been poisoned and because of aggressive behaviour and property damage. He was discharged on a community treatment order on 12 April. Between April and September 2001 he was case managed by the Community Mental Health Services. During this time, he remained stable. He entered into employment and maintained contact with Mental Health. On 11 March 2002, he was referred to the Tweed Community Mental Health Service by his parents, who reported increasing paranoia and hyperactivity. He was apparently diagnosed as having hypomania. In July of 2001, he apparently ceased his medication of his own accord. He was again admitted to the Richmond Clinic on 5 May 2002 and discharged on 9 May on a community treatment order. He continued with case management up until 8 January 2003, the Acute Care Services to provide assessment and follow-up. 
        
       
       
        
        Things again apparently deteriorated because on 11 May he had contact with the Acute Care Services following reports of his being unwell. He was monitored until 16 May and was seen by Doctor Braganza on 12 May with an over-active mind and a euphemic mood. It was shortly afterwards that the offence was committed. 
        
       
       
        
        There is before the court a statement of the Community and Court Liaison Services, reporting an assessment on 3 June 2003. This assessment was carried out on 28 May by Doctor J O’Dea, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Doctor O’Dea’s notes indicated that he was suffering a manic episode which was then resolving. He was recommenced on both anti-psychotic and mood stabling medication and had been compliant with these. There had been a noticeable improvement in his mental state since starting the medication. At the time of the report, he was described as mildly elevated in mood and remained somewhat suspicious. There was no evidence of formal thought disorder or psychotic symptoms, although his insight into his illness was described as poor and his judgment as impaired. It was determined that he was not mentally ill or disordered in terms of chapter 3 of the New South Wales Mental Health Act. 
        
       
       
        
        The most significant document presented to the Court is the lengthy report of Doctor Robert Delaforce of 29 September 2003. After noting the prior accident history, he referred to his having completed all examinations for his electrician’s apprenticeship and just had to work some more months to complete that apprenticeship. Since 1999 he had always been in employment, mainly working as an electrician though was between jobs at the time of the offence. The report noted that he had been in a de facto relationship from the age of sixteen years with the victim of the current offence. They had been separated for two years but had recently resumed the relationship, although they were not cohabiting. It was in that period his mental problems had become more apparent.” 
        
       
      
    13 Doctor Delaforce’s diagnosis was expressed in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “Bipolar one disorder, most recent episode, manic. The details he provided to me about the change in his behaviour about a week prior to the current offences were very consistent with the diagnosis of a manic episode. Prior to the current offences he had been treated since 2001 for bipolar disorder, both for a manic/hypomanic episode and major depressive episode. Since his imprisonment following the offences, he has been diagnosed with and responded to treatment for bipolar disorder. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        At the time of the current alleged offences, Mr Hopkins was in a manic episode stage of his continued bipolar disorder. The manic episode represented his disease of the mind that resulted in his defect of reasoning, such that he could not calmly, rationally and appropriate reason in relation to the moral quality of the right or wrong in what he was doing. I would therefore support a use of the defence of mental illness (McNaughton Rules) for the current change. His excessive use of alcohol at the time probably contributed to some degree to his behaviour in the offences. Nevertheless that use alone would not cause him to act as he did. Instead it was his manic episode that caused him to act as he did. He felt influenced by a spirit related to a murdered rap singer, grandiose and all-powerful because he thought he had solved the mystery of that murder, and therefore for some reason he had power and control over the victim who somehow in some irrational manic state driven way he connected to the murder and the related styles of rap music. His behaviour during the night leading to the offences is typical manic behaviour, where he inappropriately interacts with his environment.” 
        
       
       
      Doctor Delaforce also said: 
       
       
        
        Speaking generally, bipolar disorder is generally an episodic lifelong illness with a variable course. Those with untreated bipolar disorder may have more than ten total episodes of mania and depression during their lifetime. The time interval between subsequent episodes usually decreases. Although the majority have no significant symptoms of bipolar disorder between episodes, the majority will have other symptoms or impairment in psycho-social functioning such as chronic inter-personal or occupational difficulties. The natural course of bipolar disorder can be in up to about 70 percent of cases, adequately managed/controlled by mood stabilising medication such as sodium valproate (Epilim Valpro) or Lithium. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        There has been a good response to treatment during Mr Hopkins’ imprisonment such as currently no manic symptoms are present. He does currently have some depressive symptoms which are not those of a major depressive order, but normal depressive symptoms expected as a result of the offences and his imprisonment. He well understands and accepts that he needs to take for the rest of his life, medication to prevent any further episodes of depression or mania. He will need to continue to have outpatient psychiatric treatment from the Northern Rivers Area Health Service including attendance on the psychiatrist, Doctor M Braganza. In my opinion he is not at risk of any significant mental or physical harm to another person, if he was from now closely managed by outpatient psychiatric services in the community. Medication compliance can be determined by the need to do a blood test to determine the levels of sodium valproate. The risk of violence only relates to his manic episodes.” 
        
       
      
    14 Doctor Delaforce concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Probably he will continue to have improved mental health if he continues to comply with psychiatric treatment that will include continued use of psychiatric medication.” 
        
       
      
    15 The sentencing judge referred to the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, including the new provisions of Div 1A dealing with standard non-parole periods and the list of factors required to be taken into account under s21A. The standard non-parole period for the offence is ten years. As noted above, the non-parole period in this case is only six months. 
     
      
    16 Phelan DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear both from the assessment immediately after the offence, his prior mental history and the report of Doctor Delaforce, that he was labouring under considerable disability at the time in the form of mental illness, such that Doctor Delaforce was prepared to go so far as to say that the McNaughton Rules applied so as to raise the availability arguably of that defence which in the circumstances he has not pursued.” 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So that in the light of the requirement of s54B, I am satisfied that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period in this case shorter than the standard non-parole period. I have no doubt that the community would be aghast if I would proceed to sentence him on the basis that he should spend ten years in gaol for a crime in which his understanding of what was taking place was so grossly irrational as brought about by his mental state. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        On its face, if one were to accept Doctor Delaforce, which I do, there seems to be a strong argument in favour of the proposition that s5 of the Act should prevail and there should be no sentence of imprisonment at all. On the other hand, the circumstances have an objective seriousness about them, and no doubt there will be some influence of a personal nature on the offender by way of the fact that he had been in gaol since the commission of the offence, so in order to recognise that aspect of the case, I propose to fix a non-parole period of six months which will have expired on 18 November this year. There will be a balance of parole of eighteen months which will expire on 18 May 2005.” 
        
       
      
    18 The Crown did not suggest his Honour failed to apply the new scheme in Div 1A Pt 6 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1991, in accordance with its terms. It was the result alone which manifested that error must have occurred. 
     
      
    19 The submissions focused on the standard non-parole period of ten years and the degree of divergence from that statutory guide in the sentence imposed on the Respondent. This is not, however, a case which turns on the particular statutory scheme. His Honour turned his mind to the relevant question. He expressly said that he found that there were reasons for setting a non-parole period shorter than the standard non-parole period, in accordance with the provisions of s54B(2). The reasons he expressed were entirely related to the mental condition of the Respondent at the time of the events.  
     
      
    20 In its appeal the Crown submitted that his Honour placed too much weight on the Respondent’s mental condition and, alternatively or in addition, that his Honour placed insufficient weight on the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    21 His Honour expressly concluded that the mental condition of the Respondent was a direct cause of the conduct, some of it quite bizarre, constituting the offence. The objective seriousness, particularly from the point of view of the victim, was not understated in any way by his Honour. This was a degrading and frightening experience which had both short term and long term adverse consequences for the victim. These were matters which his Honour took into account. The only basis for a conclusion that his Honour gave relevant matters inadequate or excessive weight is the ultimate sentence. This is tantamount to a submission that it was not open to his Honour to give the mental state of the Respondent, which was directive causative of the commission of the offence, determinative weight. 
     
      
    22 Where two highly relevant considerations are so totally incompatible as are the two considerations involved here, it is not necessarily the case that the end result must constitute some kind of averaging out between the two. There are circumstances in which one is entitled to be determinative. 
     
      
    23 In the legislative scheme under consideration, s54B(3) permits the decision that the standard non-parole period not apply, to take into account the range of matters referred to in s21A. Amongst those matters there appears in s21A(3)(j) “the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender’s … disability”. That appears to be the case here.  
     
      
    24 A person’s mental condition may also be pertinent in the sentencing exercise in a manner not entirely encompassed by ‘awareness of the consequences of his or her actions’. Such further considerations would be encompassed by s21A(c), which extends the range of considerations to “any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence”. 
     
      
    25 The mental condition at the time of the offence, goes directly to the level of culpability of the offender and would, in our opinion, affect “the relative seriousness of the offence”. A range of such matters may arise in a particular factual situation. (See, e.g. R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; Sully Traynor “Sentencing Mentally Disordered Offenders: The Causal Link”, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, Sentencing Trends & Issues No 23, September 2002.) 
     
      
    26 The manic episode experienced by the Respondent on the day of the offence was the first occasion on which his mental condition had manifested itself in this way. This is not a case where the psychotic state was self-induced by a failure to take medication (cf R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48). 
     
      
    27 The expert medical evidence suggested that the Respondent could experience a further manic episode, if he does not take his medication. However, such further episodes are unlikely to be a frequent occurrence. 
     
      
    28 The following circumstances were given considerable weight by the sentencing judge: 
     
      
    · The Respondent had no relevant criminal history. 
     
      
    · He suffered significant brain injury in an accident and was receiving treatment for mental injury. 
     
      
    · The manic episode on the day of the offence was entirely unprecedented. 
     
      
    · There was a direct causal relationship between the mental illness and the offence. 
     
      
    · He is unlikely to offend again, as long as he takes his medication and remains subject to medical supervision. 
     
      
    29 In our opinion it was open to his Honour to conclude that on the particular facts of this case the degree of culpability of the offender was considerably attenuated to the extent that a short sentence with a very short non-parole period was within the range of the appropriate exercise of discretion. In our opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    2 WOOD CJ at CL: The Crown appeals against the sentence imposed on the respondent by his Honour Judge Dodd, in the District Court, on 12 November 2003, following his plea of guilty to one count of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. One matter was taken into account on a Form 1, being an offence of having in his custody a NSW driver’s license, which he knew to be false, with the intention of using it to induce another person to accept that it was genuine. The respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 On 15 May 2003 police carried out observations on premises situated at 3 Westbourne Lane Petersham, as a result of information received as to the possible presence of drugs at that location. The respondent and another man were seen to leave those premises and to enter a taxi. That vehicle was followed and stopped. The respondent, who was carrying a shoulder bag, ran away but was detained after a short chase. The shoulder bag, which he was endeavouring to conceal under a parked car, was recovered and searched. Inside it were found the drugs the subject of the charge, which were analysed and found to be 992.2 g of methylamphetamine of an 84.5% purity.  
     
      
    4 The respondent made no admissions at the time of his arrest, and he declined to participate in a recorded interview. He entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court and adhered to that plea in the District Court.  
     
      
    5 The respondent, however, gave evidence before Judge Dodd to the effect that he had been carrying the drugs as a favour for an older friend, in return for the supply of a lesser quantity for his personal use. He had earlier informed Dr Roberts that by the time of the offence he owed his supplier $2000-$3000. Although he acknowledged that he did not commit the offence under any form of threat, he added that he had been informed that the debt would be cleared if he did “a favour” for the dealer. It was his account that, at the time, he had been overwhelmed and affected by his drug habit, and that it was only after a considerable period in prison that his mind cleared, leaving him able to consider his conduct.  
     
      
       
      The Respondent’s Subjective Circumstances  
       
      
    6 The respondent was born in China on 22 December 1984, and was aged 19 years at the time that he appeared for sentence. His mother emigrated to Australia when he was 5 years old. In 1999, at the age of 14 years, he also came to Australia, together with his father. 
     
      
    7 He commenced schooling at the International English College before moving on to Randwick Boys High School. He dropped out of school in the year 2000, at which time he became associated with older Mandarin speaking men who introduced him to the use of illicit drugs. His habit increased to the point where he was spending up to $500 per week on ice, ecstasy and marijuana, using money that was provided by his parents. They did not become aware of his use of drugs until his arrest.  
     
      
    8 A Probation and Parole Services report, which was tendered, recorded that the respondent’s parents had separated within two months of his arrival in Australia and that this had created turmoil in his life, which had led to his use of drugs. 
     
      
    9 The author of this report observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Shi presents as a young man who had difficulty assimilating into the western culture on arrival into Australia and at the same time was damaged emotionally by learning of his parents’ pending separation. Mr Shi was remorseful for his actions and he realized how the consequence of his behaviour could affect his residency status here in Australia.” 
        
       
       
      
    10 A report from an Alcohol and Other Drug Health Promotion Worker at the Parramatta Correctional Centre confirmed that, while on remand, the respondent had completed a Relapse Prevention Program, and noted that he presented “as having the motivation to address his drug use and offending behaviour”, although adding that it was “difficult to assess his needs and progress due to his language barrier.” 
     
      
    11 The respondent’s father gave evidence to the effect that he had indeed been having trouble with his new life in Australia, and that he had expressed remorse for his offence and for the shame that had been brought on the family. A cousin gave evidence as to his strict upbringing in China, and as to the support from his family that would continue to be available for him in this country. It was the respondent’s case that he had the support of his parents and of a girlfriend whom he wished to marry in due course.  
     
      
    12 A psychiatric report from Dr Roberts was tendered on sentence that recorded the respondent’s expressions of remorse, the extent of his physical dependence on drugs at the time of his arrest, and his desire to study information technology and to rehabilitate himself in the future. It was Dr Roberts’ opinion that, at the time of the offence, he had been depressed and exceedingly vulnerable to the approach of a person offering drugs to him. 
     
      
    13 While in custody the respondent had acquired a number of certificates of achievement for a variety of courses, which were primarily directed to information technology applications. 
     
      
    14 He has had no history of employment in this country or elsewhere. His record is clear of any conviction, other than that for the present offence.  
     
      
    15 Before turning to the grounds of appeal relied upon by the Crown, it is convenient to note the circumstances which led his Honour to impose the sentence that was passed, so far as they involved findings in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, and the subjective circumstances of the applicant. 
     
      
    16 In summary, his Honour found, in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, that: 
     
      
       
      (a) his role was as a runner or courier, and not as a principal in the supply network, and that as such, he occupied a position at the bottom of the supply hierarchy in that network; 
       
      (b) he had been vulnerable because of his age, background and drug addiction; 
       
      (c) he had been used and, to a certain extent, preyed upon, because of that vulnerability by older men; 
       
      (d) his offence was not in the middle range or above for the offence, on an objective basis; 
       
      (e) he had not been a mere dupe, as he had been obtaining drugs for his own use by carrying out the delivery role; 
       
      (f) the amount of the drug was towards the high end, almost at the highest end, for a commercial quantity and was of an unusually high level of purity; 
       
      (g) since it could have been cut to a substantial extent, the amount of the drug that he was delivering was of a considerable value, and of considerable potential destructive force to people who would have been able to use it; accordingly the offence was one that was committed without regard for public safety; 
       
      (h) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity, although he was not part of its actual planning or organisation, and was not profiting except by being able to feed his own addictive habit. 
       
      
    17 In these various respects his Honour noted there were present the factors listed in s 21A(2)(i) and (n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    18 Subjectively his Honour found that the respondent: 
     
      
       
      (a) had no prior convictions; 
       
      (b) was otherwise a person of good character who was a disciplined member of a loving and law abiding family; 
       
      (c) was unlikely to reoffend and had good prospects of rehabilitation both for that reason, and on account of his age; 
       
      (d) had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity, entitling him to a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea; 
       
      (e) had shown genuine remorse; 
       
      (f) had not fully analysed his position at the time of the offence, by reason of his age, personal drug addiction, and cultural dislocation; 
       
      (g) had on his side the benefit of his youth, his drug addiction and his cultural dislocation.  
       
      
    19 As his Honour noted, the subjective circumstances included factors which fall within 21A(3)(e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    20 Special circumstances, within s 44(2) of the Act were found by reason of: 
     
      
       
      (a) the respondent’s relative youth; 
       
      (b) the fact that this would be his first encounter with the criminal law; 
       
      (c) the fact that this would be his first time in prison; and 
       
      (d) the fact that he would need a longer than usual period of supervision upon his release from prison so as to assist in his rehabilitation. 
       
      
    21 As a consequence, a sentence was set in which the non-parole period represented 50% of the entire term.  
     
      
    22 In sentencing the respondent his Honour made express reference to the provisions of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as well as to the provisions of sections 21A and 44 of that Act, noting in the course thereof, that the present case was one where the standard non-parole period for an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness, was one of imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    23 His Honour’s approach to the sentencing exercise, as a matter of principle, is encapsulated in the following passages of the reasons for sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “It might be thought therefore that the starting point in the sentencing exercise for such an offence would be to determine where in the range of objective seriousness the offence falls, and in particular whether it falls in the middle of that range…However, s 54B which applies to sentencing for such an offence provides in part: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) when determining the sentence for the offence the court is to set the standard non parole period as the non parole period for the offence, unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non parole period. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        This means therefore that irrespective of where the offence falls in the range of objective seriousness the standard non parole period is to be set unless there are reasons to do otherwise. Is its position away from the middle of the range of objective seriousness a reason to do otherwise?” 
        
       
       
      
    24 After referring to s 54B and to s 21A, his Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems strange as a matter of drafting, but as I read the legislation it is only through s 21A(1)(c) that the position of the objective seriousness of the offence away from the middle of the range can be used as a reason not to set the standard non parole period.” 
        
       
      
    25 It was contended by the Crown in substance, that error is shown in that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the factors concerning the applicant’s vulnerability, the fact that he had been used by older men, and his contrition were inappropriately taken into account by his Honour in determining the objective seriousness of the offence; 
       
      (b) too much weight was given to the finding that the respondent was at the bottom of the relevant supply hierarchy, without sufficient attention being given to the weight of the drugs and to their purity; 
       
      (c) his Honour appeared to have approached the exercise upon the basis that once the matter was found to have been outside the middle range of objective seriousness, then the standard non-parole period had no further relevance, and in particular was not taken into account as a reference point when setting a non-parole period; and in that 
       
      (d) the imposition of a non-parole period, representing 20% of the standard non-parole period, for an offence involving an amount of a drug that was just within the upper limit for a commercial quantity, was manifestly inadequate. 
       
      
    26 It was also submitted, as a general proposition, that the determination of the relevance of the standard non-parole period, for any particular sentencing exercise, “is a function of the extent to which section 21A results in a categorisation of the matter as equal to, above, or below, the middle range of objective seriousness”. It was further submitted that the “determination of whether the standard non-parole period applies cannot derive from consideration of factors extraneous to those recorded in section 21A”.  
     
      
    27 The approach which is to be taken in applying Division 1A of Part 4 was determined by this Court in Regina v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131. In that decision, it was observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “117. In order to give the Division practical utility it seems to us, in the light of the foregoing analysis, that a sentencing judge must ask and answer the following question: “are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?” 
         
         
        118. That question will be answered by considering: 
         
         
        (i) the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind; 
         
         
        (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1).  
         
         
        119. Depending upon the considerations referred to in the first of these paragraphs, it may become immediately apparent that the case is not one for which the standard non-parole period specified in the Table was intended to apply. 
         
         
        120. Whatever be the case in that regard, the considerations referred to in the second paragraph may similarly provide a reason for a departure from the standard non-parole period.  
         
         
        121. If the question, which we consider should be posed, is answered in the affirmative, then it seems to us that the Court should exercise its sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practice and by reference to the matters identified in sections 3A, 21A, 22, 22A and 23 of the Act. The ultimate objective remains one of imposing a sentence that is just and appropriate, having regard to all of the circumstances of the offence and of the offender, and so as to give effect to the purposes mentioned in s 3A of the  
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
        .  
         
         
        122. In this approach the standard non-parole period can properly take its place as a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost, along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as are applicable and relevant. In particular, it can have a direct relevance as a reference point to be compared with the sentence which is provisionally reached after an assessment has been made of the relative seriousness of the subject offence, and of the various aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as any other subjective factor that may be present, including in particular the fact, if it be the case, that the offender entered a plea of guilty. In that regard the sentencing judge will need to keep in mind that the standard non-parole periods were framed upon the assumption that the case was determined at trial and that s 22 of the Act contemplates that the fact of a plea will attract a discount. 
         
         
        123. The reference point has, in this sense, an important role to play in ensuring consistency in sentencing. Because the standard non-parole period will be imposed, subject to s 21A, for matters within the mid range, it will act as a guide for cases that are outside the mid range.  
         
         
        124. The desirability of a judge adopting the practice of standing back after reaching a provisional sentence, and of reviewing it so as to be sure that it is appropriate for the offence at hand (see the observations made in  
        R v McGourty 
         [2002] NSWCCA 335 at para 45), cannot be understated, and the existence of a standard non-parole period is likely to be of assistance in this respect.“  
         
        ” 
         
        
       
      
    28 It was noted (at para 68) that the standard non-parole period is to be regarded as one that was intended to be applicable to mid range cases determined at trial, rather than by plea.  
     
      
    29 Additionally it was observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “85. The multiplicity of purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Act, quoted above, do not suggest a narrow perspective as to the range of facts and matters that are to be regarded as “objective” facts and matters which may affect the judgment involved in assessing “seriousness”. It is too narrow a perspective to confine attention to the physical acts of the offender and their effects, as those acts or effects could be observed by a bystander. The inquiry which we consider to have been intended is one that would take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, and those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender (see for example Fox and Freiberg,  
        Sentencing 
        , 2nd Edition at paras 3.506 to 3.510).  
         
         
        86. Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said “objectively” to affect the “seriousness” of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected:  
        Channon v The Queen 
         (1978) 20 ALR 1 and  
        R v Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence.  
         
         
        87. Questions of degree and remoteness arise which will need to be developed in the case law. There are potential areas of overlap. For example, impaired mental or intellectual functioning can go to either, or both, the seriousness of the offence and punishment, so far as deterrence is concerned.  
         
         
        88. In an assessment of the objective seriousness of the subject offence it seems to us that attention must accordingly be given to the factors mentioned above. Some of these relevant factors will be elements of the offence itself. Others will fall within the list of aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in s 21A (2) and (3) of the Act, so far as they relate to purely objective considerations. . 
         
         
        89. That there is a comparison which can properly be made, and which has always been made, in the course of sentencing, between an offence in the abstract, and an individual offence, when assessing the relative seriousness of the latter is inescapable as a matter of logic, and it was something which was adverted to in  
        Walden v Hensler 
         (1987) 163 CLR 561 at 577 per Brennan J and at 595 per Dawson J.  
         
         
        90. In that comparison, it is necessary to reflect the distinction between circumstances which go to the seriousness of the offence considered in a general way, and matters that are more appropriately directed to the objectives of punishment.  
         
         
        91. If that distinction is respected then the spectrum of offences, and the identification of those which fall in the mid range of seriousness can be confined to matters which are directly or causally related to its commission. “ 
         
          
        
       
       
        
       
      
    30 In my view his Honour fell into error in four respects.  
     
      
    31 First, there seems to have been an erroneous assumption that the standard non-parole period for a Table offence applied equally whether the case was determined at trial or after a plea.  
     
      
    32 Secondly, the considerations which are relevant for an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence are not confined, as his Honour appears to have assumed, to those that fall within s 21A(1)(c) of the Act. Rather, they embrace the full range of circumstances which, upon a common sense basis and, in accordance with the principles established in R v Way are relevant for such assessment.  
     
      
    33 Thirdly, his Honour seems not to have regarded the standard non-parole period as having had any further role, whether as a reference point, or otherwise, once the conclusion was reached that the offence was not one falling within the middle range of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    34 Fourthly, insufficient consideration was given to the weight and purity of the drug involved in this instance; or to the well recognised principle that the culpability of those who engage, at any level, in drug supply networks is significant, and that deterrent sentences are necessary, since absent the involvement of couriers, warehousemen and so on, these networks, whether established for the purposes of importation or subsequent distribution, would simply collapse: R v Le Cerf (1975) 13 SASR 237 and R v Laurentio and Becheru (1962) 63 A Crim R 402. 
     
      
    35 As was decided in Regina v Way the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence before the Court is not confined to a consideration of the circumstances which are specifically listed in s 21A(2) and (3). The motive of an offender, or any condition which affects the offender’s state of mind which impinges upon the elements comprised within the mens rea is of relevance, although less so in the case of any condition which is self induced through abuse of alcohol or drugs.  
     
      
    36 If, upon their proper reading, the Crown submission amounts to a submission to the contrary, then I would disagree with that submission. I would add that the approach suggested by the Crown seemed to require an unduly rigid two-step process in the sentencing exercise, in which the existence of the standard non-parole period was elevated beyond its true role as a reference point.  
     
      
    37 I am satisfied, applying the approach that was found to be appropriate in Regina v Way that error was shown. The offence involved in this case was a serious offence, having regard to the weight and the purity of the drugs involved, and also to the fact that the respondent knowingly, and with his eyes open, lent his aid to those who directed the supply network, in order to feed his habit, and in order to clear a debt.  
     
      
    38 Clearly the case fell well below the middle range of seriousness, since the respondent was not a principal, and was not shown to have been engaged in the work of a courier on more than one occasion. There is also the fact that his supplier had taken advantage of him.  
     
      
    39 Subjectively his circumstances were particularly favourable, and there were accordingly good and sufficient reasons for a sentence to be set that involved a non-parole period below the standard non-parole period. The non-parole period which was in fact fixed, which gave the respondent the full benefit of the subjective circumstances, was, however, in my view inadequate, to the point of establishing appellable error, when it is set against the reference point provided by the standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    40 In this respect it is noted that the Crown did not press any argument to the effect that the special circumstances, within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Act, should not have been found, or applied so as to vary the statutory ratio. As was pointed out in Regina v Way, s 44(2) can still have an application for Table offences, subject to there being no double counting.  
     
      
    41 There would, in my view, have been a compelling argument in this case that the factors which were identified, save for the finding that the respondent needed an additional period of supervision post release to readjust to the community, did involve double counting. Notwithstanding, in the absence of a specific submission by the Crown, I would not be minded to alter the ratio between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence.  
     
      
    42 I am, however, of the view that there should be some increase in the sentence. In accordance with the recognised principles of double jeopardy and the discretion which applies to Crown appeals, the resulting sentence should be the least that could properly have been imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    43 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
      2. Sentence below quashed, and in lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced for the offence to which he pleaded guilty (taking into account the Form 1 offence) to a term of imprisonment which is to consist of a total term of 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years, to date from 15 May 2003. 
       
      3. Direct that the non-parole period is to expire on 14 May 2006, and specify that date as the earliest date on which the respondent will be eligible to be released on parole.  
       
      
    44 The non-parole period which I propose is still less than the standard non-parole period for a s 25 offence, by reason of the circumstances that:  
     
      
       
      (a) notwithstanding the substantial quantity and level of purity of the drug involved, the fact that it was committed without regard to public safety, and the additional fact that it was part of an organised criminal activity, the respondent’s role was that of a runner or courier, who became involved in a circumstance where he had been preyed upon by older men, and at a time when he had been vulnerable (by reason of his age and background), with the consequence that the offence fell below the mid level of seriousness.  
       
      (b) he had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity; 
       
       
      (c) he had no prior convictions and was of prior good character; 
       
       
      (d) he had good prospects of rehabilitation; 
       
       
      (e) he had shown genuine remorse; 
       
       
      (f) he had not fully analysed his position; and  
       
       
      (g) he was relatively young and would be experiencing a first term of imprisonment.  
       
      
    45 SIMPSON J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: By legislative amendment taking effect from 14 February 2004 s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 had added: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case.” 
        
       
      
    2 N.K.S. (the respondent) is standing trial before Coolahan DCJ and a jury at Newcastle District Court upon an indictment charging crimes of a sexual nature committed upon his natural daughter. The offences are alleged to have occurred on a range of dates between 1 September 1980 and 30 October 1985. In short statement there are four counts of indecent assault, two counts of carnal knowledge and one count of sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
    3 The trial commenced on 3 May 2004. The Crown case was completed by 5 May save evidence which was proposed to be called from Helen Anglais, a psychologist who was in 1985 employed in the Catholic Education organization of the Diocese of Maitland. Senior Counsel for the respondent had notified objection to this evidence and it was agreed that her evidence should be taken first on voir dire. This was done. 
     
      
    4 On 6 May, his Honour ruled that the evidence desired to be tendered by the Crown was rejected. It suffices for present purposes to adopt this summary from his reasons for judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence as sought to be led by the Crown is contained in Miss Anglais’ evidence on the voir dire yesterday. So far as 29 October 1985 is concerned, the Crown seeks to lead evidence from Miss Anglais that the accused said to her during the course of that session that he had sexual thoughts about his daughter. Miss Anglais said that he raised it in the context of what he felt was normal father/daughter relationship and sought her approval or confirmation that such thoughts were normal. However, she said that he made it clear at that stage that there had been no sexual contact or impropriety between he and his daughter.” 
        
       
       
        
        “So far as the consultation of 3 December (1985) is concerned, Miss Anglais said that this was an impromptu session, with the accused attending her rooms, unscheduled, hoping to see her. She described him as being in a state of anxiety. She saw him on that day. She said that during the course of the consultation the accused said that there had been sex with his daughter. She said that he said that there had been no penetration but mutual masturbation. She said that he told her that he had tried to stop and succeeded for about 12 months but that the complainant had paraded herself naked through the house and he saw that as enticing him and sexual relationships began again.” 
        
       
      
    5 On that day (6 May) the Director of Public Prosecutions lodged an appeal pursuant to s 5F (3A) seeking the vacation of the judgment or order made by Coolahan DCJ. Such form of order is expressly provided for in s 5F(5)(a). 
     
      
    6 On 7 May the appeal was listed before this Court. A stay of the trial proceedings was granted to enable the correctness of the ruling to be tested: R v Pera  [1999] NSWCCA 106. The material tendered consisted of a copy of the indictment and the transcript of trial to date including the learned trial judge’s reasons for the subject ruling. 
     
      
    7 After hearing argument, the court ordered that the orders rejecting the evidence of Miss Anglais relating to the conversations allegedly had on 29 October and 3 December 1985 be vacated. The stay was lifted in terms which would enable the resumption of the trial on the next weekday, Monday 10 May. The Court indicated that its reasons would be published on 11 May which would, given the stage at which the trial had reached and would be anticipated to reach, be prior to his Honour’s commencing to sum up to the jury. 
     
      
    8 The evidence proposed to be adduced from Miss Anglais is plainly admissible. It is probative of the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the respondent in terms of the conduct in which he engaged and his expressed feelings. Certainly the evidence does not purport to constitute admission of guilt of any of the specific counts in the indictment. The evidence is not tendered on that basis. It is tendered to corroborate the testimony of the complainant. 
     
      
    9 The evidence of the complainant did not encompass an act or acts of mutual masturbation but corroborative evidence need not mirror the detail of evidence to be corroborated. The essence of such evidence is well settled by authority e.g. Doney v The Queen 1990 171 CLR 207 @ 211. In the present case it is noteworthy that the respondent’s case was put to the complainant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Let me suggest to you that each of the matters you’ve described, each of them, did not take place in the way you’ve described it, what do you say? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I’ve told the truth and I have recounted everything to the best of my ability and I have been honest. These things did happen.” 
        
       
      
    10 Senior Counsel confirmed that it was the respondent’s case that no form of sexual congress ever took place between his client and the complainant. 
     
      
    11 The Crown case includes sufficient evidence to go to the jury, absent the testimony of Miss Anglais. As stated, the latter is corroborative evidence, that is, evidence to support, confirm or strengthen other evidence that the respondent committed the offences charged. The extracted summary of the proposed evidence of Miss Anglais amply demonstrates that the Crown case would be substantially weakened if her evidence was prevented from being called.  
     
      
    12 Coolahan DCJ expressed his concern that the jury would be “highly likely” to accept the evidence of Miss Anglais and use it impermissibly as an admission of guilt (of a count or counts charged in the indictment). Such a concern is readily able to be dealt with by appropriate direction. With respect of his Honour’s view, I would expect it to be obvious to jurors that what the respondent said to Miss Anglais did not amount to admissions of guilt, or even refer to, matters specified in the charges and the way that a jury can use corroborative evidence can be explained in this case as it is frequently done in other cases. 
     
      
    13 Reference was made to the proposed testimony being comprehended within the notion of tendency evidence as that expression is used in the Evidence Act. It is not. Further reference was made to the exclusion of the evidence pursuant to s 137 of that Act. There is nothing in the material before this Court to justify the exercise of discretion to exclude the evidence. 
     
      
    14 The foregoing are my reasons for joining in the orders made on Friday 7 May. 
     
      
    15 Upon pronouncement of orders, application was made on behalf of the respondent for a certificate in respect of his legal costs pursuant to the Suitors Fund Act 1951. In R v Hookham (No 2) 1993 32 NSWLR 345 this Court granted a certificate to an unsuccessful respondent in respect of litigation brought before the Court by the Crown by way of stated case. More analogous to the present situation, in R v Rima [2003] NSWCCA 405 a certificate was granted to an unsuccessful respondent to a Crown appeal brought pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The issue was the rejection of evidence of identification. Given those precedents and the present circumstances I would grant a certificate. In making that determination it is of some weight that this appeal is novel in the sense that the Court was informed by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions who appeared to prosecute the appeal that this was the first case in which the right vested by s 5F(3A) had been sought to be exercised. 
     
      
    16 In the passage through Parliament of what became the Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Act 2003 which introduced the provision, it was observed in the second reading speech that the Crown has no avenue of appeal against an acquittal which results from an erroneous evidentiary ruling but it was also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not desirable that criminal trials be unnecessarily disrupted for the purpose of appealing evidentiary rulings. It is therefore anticipated that the Crown would exercise this new appeal power only sparingly.” 
        
       
      
    17 That observation is adopted and stressed. In the present case, the volume of evidence in the Crown case and the issues surrounding the proposed evidence rejected in the court below are in relatively limited volume and focus. It can be forecast that in other cases the volume of evidence may be large yet it will be the duty of this Court to examine it, and the disputed material, to determine for itself whether the prosecution case is eliminated or substantially weakened. A task involving a large volume of material may take proportionate time for hearing and determination yet a judge and jury may have to suspend the progress of the trial in the meantime. 
     
      
    18 It is not only by sparing use of the power to appeal by the Crown that such disruption should be avoided. An accused must be apprised by the committal process of the case that is intended to be made against him or her and of the evidence in support of it. It would be a rare occurrence for legal advisers not to be able to notify any objection and there is facility in all trial courts for pre trial determination of such objections. Any appeal following dissatisfaction with a pre trial ruling can then be determined without disruption of a current trial. I am conscious that this procedure would involve assessment of whether a Crown case is eliminated or substantially weakened by the absence of particular evidence in an anticipatory rather than actual context of the trial evidence but assessment in such a circumstance is far from impractical. 
     
      
    19 A formal order is made granting to the respondent a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1951 in respect of the costs of the appeal brought by the Crown pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 challenging the orders excluding evidence made by Coolahan DCJ on 6 May 2004. 
     
      
    20 HOWIE J: I have read in draft the reasons provided by Grove J and they are substantially the reasons why I agreed that the appeal should be allowed. I simply wish to add a few brief comments. 
     
      
    21 The evidence that could be given by Ms Anglais, as set out in the judgment of Grove J, was clearly evidence of the relationship between the complainant and the accused at a time roughly approximate to the alleged offences contained in the indictment and as such was plainly admissible. It is highly probative as corroboration of the complainant’s account of the alleged sexual misconduct by the accused against her. There was nothing in the reasons given by the trial judge or in the material placed before this Court that provided any reasonable basis for the trial judge to reject it under s 137 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    22 Although his Honour purported to make a ruling on admissibility based upon a weighing of the probative value of the evidence against its unfairly prejudicial nature, that discretionary judgment was so flawed that it could not be sustained. In particular, his Honour’s belief that the jury might misuse the evidence is without foundation. The jury were entitled to regard it as an admission of his sexual interest in the complainant when considering his denial of any sexual conduct between himself and her. The fact that the complainant gave no evidence of mutual masturbation was irrelevant. There is no reasonable prospect of the jury impermissibly using it as an admission of guilt of any offence charged or in any other way. His Honour’s assessment of the unfairly prejudicial effect of the evidence as being “extremely high” does not bear scrutiny. 
     
      
    23 Although not referred to by the trial judge, Mr Dailly SC relied upon the nature of the evidence to be given by Ms Anglais in support of the rejection of the evidence. The argument was that, as the witness did not take down the actual words used by the accused at the time they were said and that she admitted to drawing conclusions from what he said, the admissions were unreliable. That is principally a matter for the jury. However, I have difficulty in understanding how a trained psychologist might erroneously infer that the accused was admitting to having indulged in mutual masturbation with the complainant when, consistently with the case to be presented to the jury, he had no sexual interest in the child at all. 
     
      
    24 Contrary to his Honour’s view, I do not believe that there is anything in the nature of the evidence that would lead the jury to ignore appropriate directions from the trial judge as to the limited, but highly relevant, use to be made of it. 
     
      
    25 NEWMAN AJ: I have read the draft judgments of Grove and Howie JJ in this matter. I agree with the reasons they have given and the order proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: I agree with Levine J. 
     
      
    2 LEVINE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon her by his Honour Judge Sides QC at Campbelltown District Court on 2 June 2003. The applicant was charged with aggravated dangerous driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor causing grievous bodily harm under s52A(4) Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is 11 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 The sentence imposed by his Honour was imprisonment for 2 ½ years to commence on 2 June 2003 and to expire on 1 December 2005. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of 15 months to expire on 1 September 2004. His Honour also disqualified the applicant from obtaining a driving license for 3 years. 
     
      
    4 The offence occurred on 1 June 2001 and the circumstance of aggravation was constituted by what his Honour found to be, on the evidence of Dr Perl, a blood alcohol concentration in the range of 0.25 to 0.28. His Honour also accepted that the offender’s driving ability would have been “very significantly impaired”. 
     
      
    5 In brief, the facts of the driving incident were: at about 6.15pm on 1 June 2001 the applicant was driving a red Magna vehicle south along Gould Road at Eagle Vale. When approaching the intersection of Aquamarine Place it was necessary for her to negotiate a right, upward curve. As she did so she crossed the double unbroken separation lines and collided with a Falcon being driven in the opposite direction by the 19-year-old victim. 
     
      
    6 The applicant received from his Honour a 25 per cent reduction in penalty for the utility of her plea of guilty. There had been some “delay” in relation to that plea but his Honour quite properly gave her the full benefit of it as the delay was founded in a live issue as to whether “grievous bodily harm” had been suffered by the victim.  
     
      
    7 The principal ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in characterising the offence as involving “a very high degree of moral culpability”. That his Honour should so find was inappropriate, it was submitted, by reason essentially of two things: the acceptance of the fact that the applicant was forced to her vehicle by acts of domestic violence and the concession by the Crown that the grievous bodily harm suffered by the victim was towards the lower end of the scale for the type of offence (permanent dental damage). 
     
      
    8 His Honour accepted the explanation that the applicant gave in the proceedings on sentence as to why she went to the car, namely to escape her boyfriend’s violence. His Honour said, however, that that did “not explain her driving in that state”. 
     
      
    9 His Honour went on to say that there was no evidence that the violent partner was pursuing her to the car, or that he attempted to get into the car or that he was attacking it in any way. His Honour was of the view that it did not fall to him to provide those details or to fill in what appeared to be gaps in the evidence. His Honour concluded that driving the motor vehicle in that state of intoxication involved a very high degree of moral culpability. 
     
      
    10 It was submitted that his Honour in coming to that view in the light of his findings represented some form of “conflict” in approach. On the one hand his Honour was accepting that there was what is in submissions said to be “significant mitigating circumstances” that would support a finding that the moral culpability was not very high, yet his Honour went on to find it. 
     
      
    11 I can say for myself that this submission completely misconstrues what his Honour in a very thorough and detailed judgment concluded. 
     
      
    12 The offence, since it was an aggravated offence, was more serious than the subject of the guideline judgment in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 which was concerned with an offence against the provisions of s52A(1) and (2) of the Crimes Act. As the Crown argued, since the offence was not one involving a case of momentary inattention or misjudgement, the applicant had a high level of moral culpability and a custodial sentence was appropriately called for: see Whyte at para [214] per Spigelman CJ. I interpolate that during the course of submissions reference was made on behalf of the applicant to suggest that the crossing of the double line represented a level of “misjudgement” on the one hand or “mishandling” of the vehicle on the other. Whatever it was, it was clearly attributable to the applicant having between 0.25 and 0.28 grammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The applicant was affected by an extremely high degree of intoxication. Conformably with what was said in Whyte (see Spigelman CJ at paras [215] and [216](iv)) a sentence more severe than imprisonment for 2 years was required. 
     
      
    13 The decision of this Court in R v Dandachli [2004] NSWCCA 100 (16 April 2004) is distinguishable by reference to the charges and the facts and does not assist the applicant. 
     
      
    14 I agree with the Crown’s submission that it was open to his Honour to find that entering the car to avoid the violence of her partner was one thing, but did not constitute an explanation of why she drove it, no matter how short the distance, before the inevitable catastrophe occurred. 
     
      
    15 I am of the view that his Honour was correct in holding the applicant’s moral culpability to be very high. The sentence imposed by him is unaffected by error. 
     
      
    16 I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    17 HIDDEN J: I agree with Levine J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Shillington QC at the Sydney District Court on 14 November 2003. The Director gave notice of the appeal on 5 December of that year. 
     
      
    2 On Wednesday 12 May 2004 the Court ordered that the Crown appeal be dismissed undertaking to provide its reasons later. 
     
      
    3 These are the Court’s reasons. 
     
      
    4 On 4 August 2003 the respondent was found guilty after a trial lasting approximately 4 weeks of the following offences:  
     
      
       
      Count 1 - For that he between 1 November 2001 and 6 February 2002 at Fairfield and elsewhere in the state of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin in an amount not less than (1 kilo) the large commercial quantity. 
       
       
      Count 2 – For that he between 1 November 2001 and 6 February 2002 at Fairfield and elsewhere in the state of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely, cocaine. 
       
      
    5 The offence under count 1 was pursuant to s25(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment: s33(3)(a). Count 2 was an offence contrary to s25(1) and carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment: s32(1)(c).  
     
      
    6 The respondent was arraigned on an indictment which contained two counts of supply, one of supplying heroin and the other cocaine, both in amounts not less than the large commercial quantity. Each count also contained an alternative lesser count of supplying an amount of the relevant drug in an amount not less than the commercial quantity (250 grams). On the 11th day of the trial the respondent pleaded guilty in front of the jury to the alternative count to count 1. The Crown did not accept this plea nor ultimately did the jury accept it. In respect of count 2 the jury were not satisfied that the respondent supplied cocaine in either an amount not less than the large commercial quantity or even a commercial quantity, but rather an amount less than the commercial quantity.  
     
      
    7 The respondent was tried jointly with 2 co-offenders, Vien Duc Do and Quynh Duc Do. Vien Duc Do was found guilty of the same 2 principal offences and had pleaded guilty at the outset of the trial to the alternative to count 1. The Crown did not accept that plea nor ultimately did the jury. Quynh Duc Do pleaded not guilty to both principal counts, however the jury found him guilty of count 1, not guilty of count 2, but guilty of the alternative to count 2. We are informed that 8 offenders were ultimately convicted and sentenced for their part in the enterprise. 
     
      
    8 A substantial drug syndicate operating in Sydney obtained heroin and cocaine in bulk in block form. The drugs were then either on-sold in that form or cut down and mixed with a cutting agent and then pressed back and on-sold in that diluted form. What is described as the “syndicate” had, as its customers, dealers. 
     
      
    9 Evidence was given that the heroin and cocaine found in block form came in the shape of a block and weighed approximately 350g. It was compressed into that shape then normally wrapped in plastic. To dilute a drug in block form, the evidence was that a piece would be cut off the block, mixed with the diluting agent, placed in a blender or coffee grinder to mix it, recompress it into a block size, or weighed and placed into amounts needed for sale. Evidence was given that a 350g block of heroin had a retail value at the time of about $120,000 to $160,000 depending on the purity and that a block of cocaine had a retail value of up to $120,000. 
     
      
    10 A house at 10 Margaret Street, Fairfield was used for the purpose of dilution, recompression and distribution of heroin and cocaine and as a meeting place for members of the syndicate. A house at 85 Station Street, Fairfield, occupied by the respondent, was used for the storage. 
     
      
    11 The issue in the case in relation to the respondent was identification, which issue, as the Crown rightly says, became a non-issue upon his pleading guilty to the alternative charge which plea was not accepted by the Crown. 
     
      
    12 The sentences imposed upon the respondent were as follows: in relation to count 1, supply prohibited drug (heroin) being an amount not less than a large commercial quantity, imprisonment for 5 years to date from 6 February 2002 and to expire on 5 February 2007; a non-parole period of 2 ½ years was fixed and it will expire on 5 August this year. In relation to count 4, which was the alternative to count 3, being supply prohibited drug being an amount not less than a commercial quantity, a fixed term of 1 year was imposed to date from 6 February 2002 and obviously has expired as indeed it had expired at the time of its imposition. 
     
      
    13 His Honour’s remarks on sentence are brief. There is an explanation for that. His Honour sentenced Quynh Duc Do, and it is to be taken from his Honour’s remarks, in the present appeal, that issues of fact and comparative roles were canvassed far more broadly in the other sentencing proceedings. His Honour had a summary of facts which described the respondent as a junior member of the syndicate.  
     
      
    14 His Honour noted in his remarks on sentence that the respondent’s primary role was to store drugs at the Station Street, Fairfield, premises. He also assisted the recompression of heroin and as runner for the syndicate in deliveries and collection of monies. 
     
      
    15 There was no evidence that the respondent was engaged in the syndicate’s activities prior to 6 January 2002, and the relevant period of any involvement was from 6 January to 6 February (the date of his arrest). 
     
      
    16 When he was arrested there was found at his premises a large quantity of the drug, some 927g of heroin. His Honour found additionally that the respondent’s role was to store drugs for the syndicate during its operation. His Honour noted a degree of contrition was reflected by the entering of the plea to the alternative charge.  
     
      
    17 His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “With regard to this prisoner before the court, he is described in this summary as a junior member of the syndicate. His primary role was to store drugs at his premises at 85 Station Street, Fairfield. He also assisted the recompression of heroin and as runner for the syndicate in deliveries and collection of monies. He was overseas from the 4th of October until the 6th January. 
        
       
       
        
        There is no evidence that he was engaged in the syndicate’s activities prior to the 6th of January, so that the period runs with regard to his activities from the 6th of January to the 6th of February. 
        
       
       
        
        When he was arrested there was found at his premises a large quantity of the drug, some 927 grams of heroin, and his role, among other things, as I have said, was to store drugs for the syndicate during its operations. 
        
       
       
        
        There is certainly some evidence of contrition on his part by entering the plea of guilty to the alternative charge, that is to the first charge. The plea to the second charge in the indictment, as I have indicated, was not accepted by the Crown and the jury ultimately returned a verdict of guilty on the first count. 
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied that the prisoner was not a major member of the syndicate. His role was a relatively menial one. He was described by the Crown in the Crown’s opening as “the general dogs’-body” and that has been emphasised by Mr Fisher in his final submissions to the court. The fact that he was required to keep the substantial quantities of drugs from time to time would suggest that he was expected to take on the relatively dangerous activities of having the drugs under his personal control. Those are the objective facts”. 
        
       
      
    18 Having dealt with the objective facts and having so characterised the role of the respondent his Honour proceeded to deal with subjective matters, finding special circumstances based upon rehabilitation needs. Apparently, upon his arrest, at his request, the respondent went into protective custody, which was peculiarly stressful for him.  
     
      
    19 The Court was assisted by the provision by both the Crown and the respondent of extremely lengthy and detailed written submissions.  
     
      
    20 The Crown submissions assert error in the view his Honour took of the role in the organisation of the respondent as entitling him to a considerable degree of leniency; in failing to have regard to the maximum penalty; in failing to have proper regard to the objective gravity of the crimes; and in giving too much weight to the subjective feature of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    21 In the course of oral submissions the Crown amplified what it had put in writing by reference to the fact that the learned sentencing Judge, so it was said, appeared not to have given sufficient attention to a description of the respondent as a “loyal, trusted and industrious lieutenant”. When, however, one reads, at the least, the extract cited from the remarks above, this view cannot comfortably be held.  
     
      
    22 Emphasis was also sought to be placed upon the asserted failure of the sentencing Judge to give proper attention to the role identified by him in such a serious commercial drug dealing enterprise (cf R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34 at [33]). In other words, as the Court understood the submission, his Honour’s focus on the role of the respondent as found by him was erroneous at the expense of balancing it in the context of the overall large commercial quantity involved in the criminal enterprise. It is to be borne in mind that his Honour of course dealt with co-offenders, and was well acquainted with the ambit of the enterprise in which each offender participated. Reference is made below to sentences imposed on other offenders, however for present purposes the Court could not be persuaded by the Crown’s proposition, more particularly articulated in the course of oral submissions. The Court also was not persuaded by the Crown’s submissions that sought to expose error on his Honour’s part by not attending to what are asserted to be lies or unsatisfactory explanations in the ERISP and the notion of “profit” as part of the major commercial criminal enterprise as distinct from “reward” in relation to storing the drugs at his premises. The point the Crown was making was that his Honour was in error in some way in not inferring that, in addition to the hundreds of dollars received for storage, by reason of the other activities in which he engaged and which his Honour noted, the respondent would have received greater remuneration. 
     
      
    23 The plea of guilty to which his Honour refers, it was suggested, was the subject of erroneous weight and attention by his Honour: it could have been no more than a mere tactical move consequent upon the admission of evidence over objection. His Honour was entitled to give such weight to that plea, as he considered appropriate. 
     
      
    24 The Crown usefully provided details of the sentences imposed upon the other offenders in relation to the charges in respect of which respectively guilt was acknowledged or guilt found. In brief, these are as follows: 
     
      
       
      Quyen Duc Do 
      
    25 He pleaded guilty to two charges of supplying heroin and cocaine both in amounts not less than the large commercial quantity. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. He was the leader of the syndicate. His Honour found conservatively that during the period of the enterprise 6 kilos of heroin and 1.5 kilos of cocaine were involved (ROS 5.9-6.1). He had a criminal record which included offences for drug supply.  
     
      
      Vien Duc Do 
      
    26 The jury found him guilty in the joint trial with the respondent of the two charges of supplying heroin and cocaine both in amounts not less than the large commercial quantity. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. Whilst Quyen Duc Do (above) was overseas from 13 to 26 January 2002 he acted as the leader of the syndicate. He was aged 25 years at the time of sentence, had no prior convictions, but had a serious gambling habit at the time of arrest and was a user of cannabis and amphetamines. 
     
      
      Quynh Duc Do 
      
    27 He stood trial jointly with the respondent and Vien Duc Do. He was convicted of the two charges of supplying heroin and cocaine both in amounts not less than the large commercial quantity. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. 
     
      
      Nam Van Pham 
      
    28 He entered an early plea to three offences contrary to s25A Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act of ongoing supply of heroin. The period spanned by the three offences was from 19 November 2001 to 5 February 2002. Each offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 4½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2½ years. He was a runner who delivered both samples and larger amounts to customers and collected the money. He was 31 years at sentence. He had prior convictions for possession of drugs and goods in custody. His Honour accepted that his involvement arose from addiction to heroin and as a means of satisfying that addiction rather than greed. He gave evidence expressing his remorse.  
     
      
      Chien Van Khong 
      
    29 He pleaded guilty to three offences. Firstly, on 2 November 2001 knowingly took part in the supply of heroin. This involved negotiating with senior members of the syndicate regarding the supply of heroin. Secondly, on 23 December 2001 he knowingly took part in the supply of cocaine. On this day he demonstrated testing methods for the purity of cocaine at 10 Margaret Street. The maximum penalty for knowingly take part in the supply of these drugs was 15 years imprisonment. Thirdly, an offence of “ongoing supply of heroin and cocaine” from 8 January to 19 January 2002. He was also a customer of the syndicate. His Honour also took into account a matter on a Form 1 being his possession of .79 grams of heroin on the day of his arrest on 29 January 2002. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. 30 These offences breached a good behaviour bond he had received in October 2000 for supplying drugs. He was 37 years at the time of sentence. At the time of his arrest he was addicted to heroin, ecstasy and cocaine. He gave evidence in which he expressed his remorse.  
     
      
       
      Minh Tuan Truong 
      
    31 He entered an early plea of guilty to two offences of ongoing supply of heroin and cocaine. The period spanned by the two offences was from 10 December 2001 to 8 January 2002. The total amount of drugs involved in these offences was 252 grams. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 4½ years with a non-parole period of 2½ years. 32 He leased the premises at 10 Margaret Street although his Honour did not find great significance in this fact. His Honour observed that “it would be in the interests of those involved more higher up in the hierarchy to keep their names off the (tenancy) document” (ROS 2.4).33 His Honour referred to the summary document A (ROS 1.8) which referred to Triet Minh Do, Nam Van Pham and Minh Tuan Truong being “runners” for the syndicate and delivering samples and larger amounts of heroin and cocaine to customers and collecting money. In imposing the same sentence as that received by Nam Van Pham, another runner, his Honour appears to have accepted the submission that this offender should not receive a heavier sentence.34 He was 28 years at the time of sentencing with a low intellectual capacity. His involvement in the enterprise was due to addiction to heroin. He had prior offences dating back to 1995 which included possession of drugs and supplying drugs, receiving a sentence of six months periodic detention for the latter offence. 
     
      
       
      Triet Minh Do 
       
      
    35 He entered an early plea to three offences of ongoing supplying of heroin and cocaine. The period spanned by the three offences was from 10 December 2001 to 26 January 2002. The total amount supplied was 670 grams of heroin and 240 grams of cocaine. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences of imprisonment of 4 ½ years with a non-parole period of 2 years. 
     
      
    36 His role was a runner. He was 31 years old at the time of sentence and addicted to gambling, heroin and using ecstasy regularly. His Honour found he became involved to fund his own need for drugs. His Honour found there were “excellent prospects for rehabilitation” (ROS 4.10), that he had had a very difficult upbringing, was a person always ready to work and that he was now intent of giving up any return to drugs. 
     
      
    37 The Crown then seeks to distinguish the role of the respondent in the context of “parity” vis-à-vis each of the above, which exercise of course can only be undertaken given certain assumptions as to the merits of the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    38 The respondent, in equally detailed submissions, paid particular attention to a record of interview given by the respondent and some evidence in other material, pointing to the extent of the respondent’s involvement which was available to his Honour for appropriate and proper consideration of the sentence of the respondent. Not unnaturally, particular attention was paid by the respondent in submissions to subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    39 In R v Hernando (2002) 136 A Crim R 451 at [12], Heydon JA, with whom Levine J and Carruthers AJ agreed, said that the Crown must surmount two hurdles if the Court is to impose a more severe sentence. The first is to locate an appellable error in the sentencing judge's discretionary decision. The second is to negate any reason why the residual discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal not to interfere should be exercised. 
     
      
    40 When one considers his Honour’s remarks on sentence against the background of such factual material as was available to this Court and which clearly had been available to his Honour, we were not persuaded of any error in his Honour’s approach. 
     
      
    41 The sentence imposed upon the respondent could well be regarded as lenient even in the context of the symmetry constituted by the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders. A view would be open that to some extent those sentences were lenient in the light of the criminal enterprise with which all of them were concerned. 
     
      
    42 The Crown failed, however, to provide any basis for this Court to intervene. Thus the order dismissing the appeal was made.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 10 December 2003 at Penrith District Court the respondent, Darren Leahy, pleaded guilty before Nicholson DCJ to a charge of armed robbery. His Honour determined that the appropriate course was to adjourn the proceedings pursuant to s11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and he gave reasons for his decision on that day. On the following day he adjourned the proceedings to 12 March 2004 and allowed the respondent bail, conditioned that he submit to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and undertake the drug rehabilitation program provided by the We Help Ourselves organisation (WHOS) at Chippendale.  
     
      
    2 On 12 December 2003 the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against that order. On 10 May 2004 we dismissed the appeal, undertaking to give our reasons later. These are those reasons. 
     
      
    3 On 12 March 2004 the respondent appeared again before Judge Nicholson. In the light of evidence of his satisfactory progress at WHOS, and also being aware that the Director had lodged an appeal, his Honour adjourned the proceedings to 11 June 2004. However, it was his Honour’s reasons of 10 December 2003 which were challenged in the appeal. 
     
      
    4 It is unnecessary to recite the facts of the offence in any detail. It is sufficient to say that in the early evening of 25 June 2003 the respondent went to the Subway restaurant in Mulgoa Road, Jamisontown, disguised by a balaclava and armed with a tomahawk. The restaurant was staffed at the time by two young women, aged seventeen and eighteen. The respondent displayed the tomahawk to the seventeen year old woman, demanded money, was given $600 from the cash register and left. There were patrons of the restaurant present at the time, including children. The incident caused great distress to the seventeen year old victim, who was terrified and who afterwards had difficulty sleeping, as well as attending to her study for the higher school certificate. 
     
      
    5 The offence was undoubtedly serious, a fact about which his Honour made no bones in his reasons for the adjournment. Moreover, the respondent was thirty five years old at the time of the offence and was by no means a first offender. He has a substantial criminal record, although he has no previous conviction as serious as the present offence. The entries comprise offences of violence and dishonesty, drug offences and driving offences. All were dealt with summarily but for many of them he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In this and in a number of other respects his Honour found that there were aggravating factors within the meaning of s21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    6 The respondent was arrested on the same day as the offence, made full admissions to police in a recorded interview, and pleaded guilty from the outset. He committed the robbery to obtain money to buy heroin, and it is his long-standing drug addiction which led his Honour to take the course he did. 
     
      
    7 The respondent had been using heroin and amphetamines since his teenage years. As is so often the case, his conflict with the criminal law was against the background of this abuse. However, in the three years prior to the present offence he had tried to address the problem, spending periods of several months at WHOS in 2000 and again in 2001. He appears to have had a measure of success, moving into a Housing Department flat at Kingswood and avoiding the company of his former associates. However, he relapsed into drug use after a tragic accident in February 2003 when his flat mate fell to his death from the balcony of the flat. It was in these circumstances that the armed robbery was committed a few months later. 
     
      
    8 At the time he appeared before his Honour he had been in custody for over five months. He told a psychiatrist who provided a report to the court that he had not used illicit substances on a regular basis during that period, but that he still felt the urge to do so. While he was making a personal effort to remain abstinent, he was willing to undergo a further six month period of residential rehabilitation. 
     
      
    9 Judge Nicholson said of the respondent that the “principal threat to his rehabilitation is his drug abuse.” Nevertheless, his Honour saw hopeful signs of rehabilitation in the history which I have outlined. In addition, he had resolved differences with members of his family and enjoyed their support, and had developed his skill as a guitarist and songwriter. His Honour recognised that the objective criminality of the offence and the need for deterrence called for “a substantial period of custody …” However, he added that “the question of what weight is to be given to his rehabilitation prospects is an important factor.”  
     
      
    10 His Honour referred to the examination of s11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by Smart AJ, with whom Spigelman CJ and Grove J agreed, in R v Trindall (2002) 133 ACrimR 119 at [41] ff. He concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it would be so much better for me to have evidence of what has actually taken place than to seek to sentence on some sense of false euphoria as to progress that has thus far been made. For that reason I have determined that it is appropriate to have regard to the two matters to which s11 allows me to have regard. I am entitled to adjourn proceedings for the purpose of assessing the offender’s capacity and prospects of rehabilitation and I intend to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        I am entitled to give him an opportunity to demonstrate that his rehabilitation is taking place.” 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour’s reference to “the two matters to which s11 allows me to have regard” was derived from the opening words of s11: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A court that finds a person guilty of an offence (whether or not it proceeds to conviction) may make an order adjourning proceedings against the offender to a specified date, and granting bail to the offender in accordance with the Bail Act 1978: 
         
          
         
        (a) for the purpose of assessing the offender’s capacity and prospects for rehabilitation, or 
         
         
        (b) for the purpose of allowing the offender to demonstrate that rehabilitation has taken place, …” 
        
       
      
    12 The Crown prosecutor before us submitted that his Honour’s resort to s11 amounted to an error warranting this Court’s intervention. Put shortly, he argued that the case was one in which a substantial custodial sentence was inevitable and that no purpose would be served by further evidence of rehabilitation in determining either the head sentence or the non-parole period.  
     
      
    13 In Trindall Smart AJ examined s11 against the background of authorities dealing with the common law procedure of the Griffiths remand: Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293. It is unnecessary to set out his Honour’s observations, which have been cited in a number of subsequent cases. It is sufficient to say that his Honour concluded that an adjournment under s11 is not confined to cases in which, if the offender maintained progress towards rehabilitation, a non-custodial sentence might be expected. The adjournment may be appropriate in cases, such as the present, where a fulltime custodial sentence remains the most likely outcome even if rehabilitation has been achieved. The sentencing court still has the advantage of a more reliable assessment of the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation in determining both the head sentence and the non-parole period. The same approach was endorsed by this Court in  R v Di Gregorio [2004] NSW CCA 9 and R v Williams [2004] NSW CCA 64. 
     
      
    14 This is not to deny that the s11 procedure is one which should be used sparingly. In most cases the sentencing court will be adequately informed about the offender’s rehabilitation prospects, and to adjourn the proceedings under the section would be merely to delay the inevitable for no good purpose. In Trindall Smart AJ said at [64]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The granting of a  
        Griffiths 
         remand is likely to arise for consideration in a relatively small number of cases. Generally, such a remand should not be granted unless there are good reasons for concluding that it is likely to assist the court in determining whether an offender should be sent to gaol or in fixing the length of the sentence or the non-parole period.” 
        
       
       
      By the expression “a  
      Griffiths 
       remand” his Honour was, of course, referring to an adjournment under s11. 
       
      
    15 In R v Palu (2002) 134 ACrimR 174 at [30], Howie J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The exercise of the power given under s11 will inevitably result in delay in the finalisation of the prosecution of the offender. On many occasions, as in the present case, that delay will be substantial. Unless the further delaying of the sentencing of the offender is wholly justified in order to ensure that the sentencing discretion is properly exercised, there will be a miscarriage of justice. Time and again sentencing courts are asked to have regard to the delay in sentencing an offender as a matter of mitigation because of the adverse effects of delay upon the well-being of the offender and the disruption it causes to his or her everyday life. Delay unavoidably results in unfairness: unnecessary delay results in injustice. Steps have been taken throughout the criminal justice process to eliminate unnecessary delay wherever possible. Unless delay in the sentencing of the offender is essential in order to ensure a just result, the court has failed in its duty both to the offender and the community.” 
        
       
      
    16 It is apparent from his reasons, including his reference to passages from Trindall, that his Honour was well aware of these principles. It is also apparent from those reasons, and from the transcript of the preceding discussion between his Honour and counsel, that the respondent was left in no doubt that he would most probably be facing a fulltime custodial sentence at the end of the adjournment period. His Honour’s decision was a discretionary one. In our view, it was open to him to conclude that the adjournment would be of material assistance in the sentencing process and was in the interests of justice. In any event, given the well recognised constraints upon this Court’s intervention in a Crown appeal, we were not persuaded that his Honour’s order should be set aside.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: This is an appeal against sentence by Steven Rodney Craig Fernando (the applicant). Mr Fernando was charged with breaking and entering a dwelling house at Walgett on 22 June 2001, and having committed a serious indictable offence therein, namely an act of indecency, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900. Mr Fernando pleaded guilty to that offence. He was sentenced by English DCJ on 3 June 2003 to a term of imprisonment of 9-1/2 years with a non parole period of 7 years 1 month and 16 days. 
     
      
       
      The incident. 
       
      
    3 The complainant is a woman who lived alone in a house at Walgett. At the time of the incident she was 29 years old. On Thursday 21June 2001 she went to bed at about 11.00 pm. Before doing so, she locked the doors and windows of her home. At approximately 3.30 am she woke up as the applicant placed his hand across her mouth to prevent her screaming. With his other hand, he groped for her vagina, later moving his hand towards her buttocks.  
     
      
    4 The complainant resisted as strongly as she was able. She tried to place her attacker in a headlock. She attempted to gouge his eyes and grabbed at his earring. In the course of the struggle she fell off the bed. As she did so she upset a glass of water on her bedside table. The glass fell to the floor and smashed, as did her bedside lamp. 
     
      
    5 The complainant fell onto the broken glass, lacerating her back. Her attacker fell on top of her. He grabbed at her genital area through her pyjama pants. The complainant then took hold of a sliver of glass from the floor and threatened her assailant. He got up and withdrew. She went to the window after he had fled. She saw a pile of her property in the garden. It included her handbag and other personal items. Her attacker had gained entry by forcing a window. 
     
      
    6 The complainant in fact knew Mr Fernando, although not well. In the darkness, however, she did not recognise him. She could only describe her assailant in very general terms. He was thin. He was young. She thought he was 18 or a little older and Aboriginal. 
     
      
    7 She telephoned a friend, who came to her home, having first summoned an ambulance and the police. She was taken to the Walgett hospital where 19 stitches were inserted in the lacerations to her back. There were significant bruises to the genital area and her inner thigh. She has been left with scarring to her back. 
     
      
    8 In the course of the struggle Mr Fernando lost an earring. He also left behind a pair of blue scissors. The police approached two persons whom they regarded as suspects, neither being Mr Fernando. They obtained DNA samples from each. A comparison was made between these samples and the DNA found on the earring. There was no match. 
     
      
    9 In April 2002 the complainant told the police of her suspicion that Mr Fernando may have been her attacker. On 26 April 2002 the police spoke to Mr Fernando at the Walgett police station. He was invited to provide a buccal swab, having been warned (on video) that he was not obliged to do so. He agreed to do so. The sample was then analysed. It matched the DNA obtained from both the scissors and the earring. 
     
      
    10 The police then attempted to locate Mr Fernando. He had been charged in the meantime with other offences and given bail. However, he failed to answer his bail. Ultimately, on 29 June 2002, he presented himself at the Walgett police station and was arrested.  
     
      
    11 The impact upon the complainant of the attack has been severe. A Victim Impact Statement was tendered. English DCJ described the effect upon her in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""His victim has been left physically and emotionally scarred. The scarring to her back resulted from the lacerations sustained during the struggle with the offender, glass remains embedded at the site of the scarring, and she says it is painful. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She has received, and requires, ongoing counselling. She has gone from being a financially independent employed young woman to someone in receipt of Government assistance, who is now required to live with her mother. Her social life has suffered as has her capacity for work."" 
        
       
       
      Breach of parole. 
       
      
    12 At the time of the offence Mr Fernando was on parole. This was a serious matter of aggravation. There were also similarities between the offences which were the subject of the parole order and the offence of 22 June 2001, although there were differences. On 10 February 2000 Mr Fernando had pleaded guilty before English DCJ to two counts which were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Count 1: 
         On 20 February 1999 at Walgett did, in circumstances of aggravation, break and enter a dwelling house at 104 Arthur Street and did commit a felony therein, namely did steal a pair of scissors, a number of handbags and their contents and a quantity of beer. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         On 20 February 1999 at Walgett, did break and enter the garage of Terence John Gudgeon situated at 8 Peel Street, and then in the garage did steal two outboard motors, two fuel cans and two spotlights. ..."" 
        
       
      
    13 Her Honour, on that occasion, found special circumstances. On the first offence she imposed a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a minimum term of 1-1/2 years, and on the second a concurrent fixed term of 1 years imprisonment. Mr Fernando was released on parole on 13 October 2000. Within less than a year (22 June 2001) he committed the present offence. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case. 
       
      
    14 Mr Fernando was born at Walgett on 27 May 1980. He was 21 years when the offence occurred and 23 years when sentenced (3 June 2003). He was the first of ten children of his mother. She was 18 at the time of his birth. She is Aboriginal and his father is Caucasian. Mr Fernando has not met his father. He feels some anger at his father's neglect. 
     
      
    15 Soon after his birth the applicant was given into the care of his grandmother. She brought him up in a small Housing Commission home. She had several other children. There were ten living in the home. He also saw his mother from time to time, as well as his siblings. He witnessed the violence of his mother's relationship with one of her husbands. 
     
      
    16 At an early age Mr Fernando began smoking cannabis and drinking. Although assessed as soundly intelligent, literate and well able to express himself, he left school at an early age. Apart from odd jobs, he has not been employed. Her Honour, in her remarks on sentence, having referred to the principles in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, said this: (at 5/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have taken into account his disadvantaged circumstances, dysfunctional upbringing, overcrowded living conditions, exposure to violence, alcohol and drugs, lack of contact with his nature father, and limited education, as I am required to do."" 
        
       
      
    17 Mr Fernando had a long term relationship and a child who, at the time he was sentenced, was one year old. He had been brought before the Children's Court on a number of occasions. Control orders had been made. Having been sentenced by English DCJ on 10 February 2000, and released to parole on 13 October 2001, he committed a number of other offences apart from the offence which is the subject of this appeal. The offences included committing an act of indecency with a person 16 years or over, for which he was sentenced on 7 August 2002 to 3 months imprisonment commencing on 29 June 2002, being the date of his arrest on the present charge. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence. 
       
      
    18 Having heard submissions on sentence, her Honour reserved her decision. Her remarks are detailed. In respect of the offence, she said this: (at 10) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The objective facts involve a serious breach of the criminal law. I regard the objective seriousness of the offence as being at the top end of the scale constructed for like offences. There is no need for me further to enlarge upon the seriousness of the offence, so much can be seen from the maximum penalty imposed for like offences by the legislature. 
        
       
       
        
        General and specific deterrents are matters which loom large in a sentencing exercise of this offender, and the community has a rightful expectation to be protected from the likes of this offender. 
        
       
       
        
        I find the subjective features lose much of their force as this offender has committed a similar serious offence in the not too distant past. The matter is one which calls for the imposition of a custodial sentence."" 
        
       
      
    19 The breach of parole was obviously a serious matter of aggravation. However, it created an issue as to the commencement date of the sentence. The parole was not due to expire until 13 April 2003. It had been revoked after Mr Fernando's arrest on 29 June 2002. As set out above, there was the further complication that on 7 August 2002 he was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for an unrelated offence, the sentence commencing on 29 June 2002. 
     
      
    20 Her Honour, in these circumstances, appropriately, recognised the potential for double counting. She said this: (at 10) 
     
      
       
        
        ""As his breach of parole has been taken into account, as an aggravating circumstance, the sentence to be imposed will be backdated to take into account the time spent in custody after the commission of this offence, so the offender is not being punished twice for breach of parole."" 
        
       
      
    21 When dealing with the subjective material, her Honour drew attention to her concerns in respect of rehabilitation. She said this, referring to a report of Ms Robilliard, psychologist: (at 8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Following personality testing Ms Robilliard expresses concern at his test results, results which indicate deeply entrenched psychopathology in several areas. His attitude is according to Mr Robilliard that he will only undergo sex offender therapy 'if he has to'. I infer from the report that he is well aware of the need to be motivated to undertake such therapy before the therapy has any prospects of success."" 
        
       
      
    22 Her Honour referred to the leniency extended to Mr Fernando when he was sentenced by her in February 2000, and the lengthy period of parole. She added: (at 9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have no confidence that he will undergo rehabilitation, either voluntarily or forcibly. As he clearly knows rehabilitation is only successful if the offender is motivated. He has acknowledged that to Ms Robilliard during their sessions together. One thing is certain he has continued to re-offend. Not only did he commit this offence whilst on parole, but he has committed further offences. Those are not matters which I have taken into account on sentence, but rather are referred to, to demonstrate why I have little confidence in his prospects of rehabilitation.""  
        
       
      
    23 Her Honour did not accept that Mr Fernando felt contrition. She said this: (at 8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am not satisfied that this offender is either remorseful or contrite. His plea of guilty, once confronted with the DNA evidence, is in my view on his part merely an acknowledgment of the inevitable irrespective of how the sample came to be provided. It is of very great concern that he will only attempt rehabilitation if forced to do so."" 
        
       
      
    24 Her Honour did not, as such, quantify the discount for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    25 When she began her sentencing remarks her Honour mistakenly described the offence as arising under s112(2), being an aggravated form of breaking into a house and committing a serious indictable offence. The matter of aggravation was not identified (cf s105A(1) Crimes Act 1900). The maximum punishment under s112(2) is 20 years imprisonment (cf 14 under s112(1)). Her Honour sentenced Mr Fernando upon that basis to 13-1/2 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 10 years 1 month and 16 days. The Crown then rose and drew her Honour's attention to the error. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Your Honour it has become apparent to me since your Honour dealt with the matter earlier today, that I unintentionally misled your Honour in relation to the earlier course of the proceedings. What I had said to your Honour was this. I led your Honour to believe that what had happened was this. That in March, when Mr Fernando was arraigned he was arraigned on one count of break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation. To that end I gave to your Honour a bundle of papers including what I thought was a copy of that document. It transpires that I was incorrect. What in fact had happened in March was that he was arraigned on one count of break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence in its simple form. For your Honour's purposes the significant difference is this. The maximum penalty for the thing that I told your Honour he pleaded guilty to was 20 years. What he in fact pleaded guilty to was an offence carrying 14 years as a maximum penalty. ..."" 
        
       
      
    26 The Crown then made application under s43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to correct the error. Counsel for Mr Fernando joined in that application. Her Honour corrected the error at once. Having described what had happened, and the difference in the maximum penalty, her Honour said this: (at 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I therefore correct the sentence entered by me by setting that part of it aside. I made reference to the remarks delivered by me to the aggravating circumstances which would have applied, had the charge been brought under s112(2) and those remarks are to be corrected to reflect the offence for which the offender is now facing sentence, that is not an aggravated offence, and that portion of the judgment is to be edited accordingly."" 
        
       
      
    27 She added: (at 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This does not mean, however, that the matter does not remain a serious breach of the criminal law and it continues to fall at the top end of the scale for such offences, and the offender is of course entitled to the discounts which were previously applied."" 
        
       
      
    28 Mr Fernando was then sentenced to 9-1/2 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 7 years 1 month and 16 days. 
     
      
       
      The Amended Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    29 An Amended Notice of Appeal was filed in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1:  
        Her Honour erred in not allowing a sufficient discrete allowance for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty, irrespective of the strength of the Crown case. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2:  
        Her Honour erred in failing to give an appropriate allowance for the applicant's assistance to authorities by way of the supply of a DNA sample. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3:  
        The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    30 However, in argument, the grounds were, to some extent, refined and in other respects, broadened. Without abandoning the first ground, most of the argument was directed to the second. On the third ground, complaint was made concerning the adjustment undertaken by her Honour once the error had become manifest. The adjustment was mathematical. No attempt had been made to re-evaluate the appellant's criminality in the light of the actual offence to which he had pleaded guilty, that is, under s112(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      The discounts on sentence. 
       
      
    31 It is convenient to deal with grounds 1 and 2 together. In respect to the plea of guilty, and the provision of the DNA, her Honour said this: (at 9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The offender is, of course, entitled to the benefit for his plea of guilty in having utilitarian value. He is also entitled to a further discount as he chose to present himself at the police station and to undergo DNA testing voluntarily. I have had regard to the fact that he was not one of two suspects initially under suspicion, although the complainant did attend at the Walgett Police Station and nominate the offender as her possible attacker prior to his arrest. His partner, Edna Gibbs, made a statement in which she stated she saw the offender in June 2001 with a swollen, bleeding ear. He also had a swollen and bruised hand at the time. She was able to confirm that the offender wore an earring in his right ear, although she could not identify the earring shown to her by police as being an earring worn by the offender during the time they were together."" 
        
       
      
    32 Her Honour, as mentioned, did not quantify the discount for the plea of guilty. It would have been helpful had she done so (R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, per Spigelman CJ at 418/419 paras 157, 158 and 160). However, she was not obliged to do so. No error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    33 Counsel for Mr Fernando made the following submission: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Her Honour placed no significance on the way that the DNA was volunteered, notwithstanding that this was evidence bearing on contrition and afforded utility to the investigation of the offence in circumstances where it was by no means certain that a sample could be compelled."" 
        
       
      
    34 In argument, counsel went further. He asserted that there was error in not quantifying the discount in respect of the provision of DNA. 
     
      
    35 Under Part V of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000, the police may make application to a Magistrate for an order that a defendant supply a sample of DNA (s25). A Magistrate may make an order when satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person, the subject of the application, has committed an offence. 
     
      
    36 Counsel for Mr Fernando analysed the information available to the police at the time his client was asked to provide a DNA sample (26 April 2002). Mr Fernando's appearance conformed to the very general description the complainant had provided of her attacker. He had also been behaving oddly, and somewhat suspiciously, in the vicinity of the complainant, after the offence. Information, mainly hearsay, had been passed to her concerning the suspicions others entertained in relation to Mr Fernando. The complainant passed that information to the police. It was not until some months after Mr Fernando had voluntarily provided a DNA sample that rather more concrete information was provided to the police by his former partner, the mother of his child. She made a statement on 29 June 2002 which included the following:  
     
      
       
        
        ""4. I remember about June last year Steven came home to 86 Peel Street and told about a fight he had with Lucas Fernando. I saw his ear was swollen; it was bleeding and looked like it was getting infected. His hand was also swollen and bruised. I don't know what the fight was over and I don't know if he went to see a doctor, he doesn't go to doctors. I remember it being his right ear."" 
        
       
      
    37 I am prepared to assume that an application by the police in April 2002 for an order that Mr Fernando should provide a DNA sample was certainly not assured of success. Should the provision of DNA in such circumstances be reflected in a specific discount? Can it be said that there was error in not doing so? 
     
      
    38 Counsel for the applicant was unable to point to any authority which directly supported his contention. Reference was made to R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 and the statement of principle by Street CJ (at 604) where a person voluntarily discloses his involvement in a crime otherwise unknown to the police. Counsel also referred to Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339, where the majority of the Court spoke of a willingness to facilitate the course of justice as a matter in mitigation. In AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111, Gummow and Callinan JJ referred to the waiver by the defendant of extradition rights. Having been extradited on certain offences, the accused confessed to other offences which were not part of the extradition order. In respect of the same aspect, Kirby J said this: (at 148) 
     
      
       
        
        ""However, there was one further and particular consideration, additional to the foregoing, that was not given any attention at all. This was that, had the appellant not waived his privilege under extradition law to insist on the speciality, it would have been effectively impossible, or certainly extremely difficult, to try and punish him for the thirty-nine offences which he disclosed after his extradition. The appellant's confessions exposed him to additional punishment for the thirty-nine offences which he acknowledged against nine additional pupils. It also resulted in judicial castigation for the number of victims and the duration of his offences which could not have been prosecuted without evidence that the appellant did not object on the basis of speciality and without the consent of the United States. Without such evidence, it would have been extremely difficult or virtually impossible to obtain that consent."" 
        
       
      
    39 His Honour added: (at 148/149) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Unless the sentencing judge were to mark in a specific and express way the credit to which the appellant was entitled for having surrendered his privilege to insist on the rule of speciality under extradition law, the outcome of this case would not encourage others, in a like position, to act as he did (cf  
        R v Winchester 
         (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 at 350). "" 
        
       
      
    40 The matter was returned to the Court of Criminal Appeal for further determination (Spigelman CJ, O'Keefe and Barr JJ). The head sentence was reduced by 25 percent. Barr J (with whom Spigelman CJ agreed) said this: (para 97) 
     
      
       
        
        ""97. ... It was conceded by counsel for the Crown that the utilitarian value of the appellant's pleas of guilty, his voluntary co-operation and his waiver of his extradition rights concerning the post-extradition offences entitled him to a reduction of twenty-five percent from the sentence which would otherwise apply. I think that the concession was appropriate and I would make such an allowance."" 
        
       
      
    41 Here there was no justification for a specific discount. Mr Fernando did not give evidence. It is not known, for instance, whether Mr Fernando appreciated that the police had his earring, although he presumably knew he had lost an earring. His motivation in providing the sample was unknown. In some circumstances co-operation with the police may signify contrition, especially where admissions are made after arrest, and more especially made in respect of matters completely unknown to the police (as in R v Ellis (supra)). Contrition may justify more lenient treatment, although the degree of leniency is not usually quantified. Where an offender unwittingly assists the police, whether by making statements which he does not recognise as incriminating, or providing a sample of his handwriting or DNA, not fully appreciating its evidentiary significance, it is difficult to see why any discount is justified unless it can be seen as evidence of contrition. 
     
      
    42 Her Honour, in this case, acknowledged Mr Fernando's co-operation and said that she took it into account. Her failure to elaborate, or quantify the discount does not, in my view, amount to error. 
     
      
       
      Was the sentence manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    43 There was no specific challenge to the characterisation by her Honour that the offence was at ""the top end of the scale"". The challenge, rather, was to the mathematical adjustment of the sentence, once the error had emerged. 
     
      
    44 It is clear from an examination of her Honour's remarks, including those made immediately after the error came to light, that she did mathematically adjust the sentence. The proportions between the maximum penalty under the statute, the term of imprisonment imposed and the non parole period, remained constant once Mr Fernando was re-sentenced under s112(1). The applicant submitted that his criminality, in the light of the elements of s112(1), was not reconsidered. To only adjust the sentence mathematically, it was suggested, was too crude an approach, and signified error. 
     
      
    45 The Crown acknowledged that the approach of her Honour was mathematical and, as such, too crude. Ordinarily such an approach could be expected to produce error. However, as it happened, the sentence finally imposed, given the serious nature of the crime, and specifically the breach of parole, was, in the Crown's submission, appropriate. According to the Crown, no lesser sentence was justified (s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912); R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, paras 79-80 per Spigelman CJ, and para 100 per Sully J. 
     
      
    46 The adjustment by her Honour was crude. However, her Honour, once the error became known, did to a limited degree revisit the issue of Mr Fernando's criminality. She should perhaps have recomposed her remarks so that they unmistakeably addressed s112(1). However, the result, I believe, would have been no different. The crime by Mr Fernando was very serious. It was at the top end of the scale. It had been committed in circumstances of a breach of parole. Mr Fernando had been given the benefit of leniency in the past and failed to take advantage of it. Deterrence, both personal and general, was important. The sentence was appropriate. I am not persuaded that any lesser sentence was warranted in the circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    47 The orders I propose therefore are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal should be granted. 
       
       
      2. The appeal should be dismissed. 
       
      
    48 BELL J: I agree with Kirby J.

     REGINA v Thi Bach Tuyet DO 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J: I agree with the orders proposed and with the reasons given.  
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Thi Bach Tuyet Do, was tried in the District Court upon a charge of importing into Australia a trafficable quantity of heroin. She was found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. She appeals against conviction only.  
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    3 The evidence in the Crown case was not in dispute. The appellant travelled from Australia to Vietnam on 26 September 2002, returning to this country on 20 October. Upon her arrival at Sydney Airport, customs officers found heroin concealed in her shoes. Interviewed with the aid of a Vietnamese interpreter, she told the officers that she had bought the shoes at a market in Vietnam and did not know that there was anything secreted in them. Australian Federal Police officers came to the airport and she gave them the same account, saying that she had travelled alone and no-one had asked her to bring the shoes into the country. In a later recorded interview at AFP headquarters, she gave quite a detailed account of the circumstances in which she had to discard the shoes which she had been wearing and of her purchase of the new shoes. 
     
      
    4 However, the appellant took part in a further recorded interview on 4 February 2003, in which she retracted that account. Put shortly, she said that about a year earlier she had borrowed some money from a woman named Huang, whom she had met while gambling at the casino in Sydney. With interest, that debt had grown to a considerable sum, and some days before her trip to Vietnam Ms Huang had threatened her life if she did not repay it. She said that Ms Huang introduced her to a male associate, and arrangements were made for her to travel to Vietnam to “do something” for them, in return for which she would be paid some money and her debt would be discharged. 
     
      
    5 She went on to say that Ms Huang made the travel arrangements and she was accompanied on the journey by a woman named Mai, an associate of Ms Huang. In Vietnam they were given three dresses and two pairs of shoes, and the appellant was instructed to take them back to Australia and give them to Ms Huang’s brother. Mai wore one of the pairs of shoes, and she told the appellant to discard her own shoes and wear the other pair. The appellant said that she did not know that anything was concealed in those shoes. There were diamantes sewn into the dresses, and she thought that the enterprise was the smuggling of diamonds into Australia. 
     
      
    6 The appellant also said that, if anything went wrong, she had been instructed to say that she had bought the shoes and dresses at a market and had been assured that she would be looked after. She was also told that her life would be in danger if she implicated any of those involved in the enterprise. 
     
      
    7 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial, but relied upon her account to police in the second recorded interview as her case. The only issue at the trial was the mental element of the offence, that is, whether the appellant knew that she was, or was likely to be, carrying heroin into Australia: Pereria v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 63 ALJR 1. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    8 Neither the Crown prosecutor nor senior counsel for the appellant in this Court had appeared at the trial. Two grounds of appeal were argued, although reliance was placed primarily upon one of them. This ground arose from the trial judge’s directions to the jury about the appellant’s admitted lies to customs officers and police when she was first interviewed.  
     
      
    9 The Crown prosecutor at the trial did not rely upon those lies as evidence of a consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant of the crime charged. His only argument had been that they bore upon the credibility of her account to police in the second recorded interview. However, in summing up his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown has suggested to you that the accused has been telling lies concerning these matters. Of course, that is a question of fact for you to decide, but indeed, in relation to the first interview, it is not disputed that she was telling lies. If you find that she has been lying, it does not necessarily mean that she is guilty. She is not charged with lies, she is charged with the offence of importation. People can tell lies for a number of different reasons, fear of being wrongly convicted, being one of them, I suppose. The Crown still bears the onus of proving the case against the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        However, if you are satisfied that the accused was telling lies, one effect it may have is to make it easier for you to accept the evidence of the Crown witnesses, and the inference which the Crown says you should draw from that evidence, whether it does have that effect on you, is entirely a matter for you. 
        
       
      
    10 Later, in the course of directing the jury about the mental element of the offence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        In the present case the Crown sets out proving the intention in this way, as I understand it. They say, firstly, she had actual knowledge of the importation and in relation to that, as I understand it, they say when she was arrested or spoken to at the airport she in fact had brought the heroin into the country. That is the first thing, she brought it. It was not in somebody else’s luggage, it was she who brought it in attached to her feet, she walked it in, and they then say that if you look at the reasons that she gave at the time she lied and she lied deliberately about that. She told a story that was untrue and fanciful and just would not stand up to examination, and the reason for doing that, they would suggest, is because she knew she had it in her shoes, that material being a narcotic substance. 
        
       
       
        
        Counsel for the accused says: well, she knew she was bringing something in but she did not think it was narcotics. She thought it was diamonds. That is not what she said originally. What she said was she did not know and only came upon these shoes when something happened, and you have got a transcript that it only happened when she was coming out of the hotel and the strap broke on her shoe and she needed to get another pair. They sold her the pair containing 600 grams of heroin. The Crown said you would not accept that as anything other than lies and that you would be satisfied of itself in relation to this charge that she knew and therefore intended to bring into the country the prohibited import, namely, the narcotics. 
        
       
      
    11 These directions must have conveyed to the jury that they could use the evidence of the appellant’s lies to infer her knowledge of the presence of the heroin in the shoes, which was the central issue in the trial. Clearly, then, the jury were invited to treat the lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt: Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193. As such, the directions failed to meet the now familiar requirements spelled out in the joint judgment in Edwards at 210-11. 
     
      
    12 His Honour did not identify with precision the relevant lies, although they may well have been apparent to the jury. He did not direct the jury that they must be satisfied that the appellant lied because she knew that the truth would implicate her in the offence charged. He touched upon the proposition that a person may lie for reasons consistent with innocence of the crime charged. However, his brief reference to the appellant’s asserted belief that she was involved in the smuggling of diamonds would not have conveyed to the jury that her account in the second recorded interview provided a possible explanation for her lies consistent with innocence: that she believed she was involved in an illegal activity, albeit different from the offence charged, and that she feared reprisals if she revealed the true circumstances, thereby implicating others.  
     
      
    13 More importantly, however, the case was not one in which an Edwards direction was called for at all. As I have said, the Crown prosecutor relied upon the lies as bearing upon the credibility of the appellant’s account in the second interview, not as evidence of consciousness of guilt. The importance of the distinction was emphasised in the joint judgment in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 at [15] ff. In my view, all that was appropriate in the present case was a direction along the lines suggested by their Honours at [23], explaining to the jury how the Crown relied upon the lies, leaving it to them to determine their significance in relation to the central issue in the case, and cautioning them against reasoning that the appellant was guilty simply because she had lied. A recent examination of that approach, together with helpful references to authority, is to be found in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Ray [2003] NSW CCA 227 at [72] ff. 
     
      
    14 No redirection about this matter was sought by counsel for the appellant at the trial but, given its significance, I would not refuse leave to argue this ground. The Crown prosecutor in this Court properly and fairly acknowledged that it would not be appropriate to apply the proviso. The ground is made out and there must be a new trial. 
     
      
    15 However, brief mention should be made of the other ground which was argued. The appellant raised her character at the trial, her counsel eliciting in evidence from a federal police officer that she had no previous convictions. In his final address to the jury, counsel told them that they could consider that evidence of good character on the question whether she knew the heroin was in her shoes and also “in assessing her credibility.” The trial judge interrupted counsel at that point, saying that the evidence could not be relied upon in support of the appellant’s credibility as she had not given evidence at the trial. His Honour later affirmed that view in the absence of the jury. 
     
      
    16 As the Crown prosecutor in this Court conceded, this was in error. In R v Murphy (1985) 4 NSWLR 42 at 54, after a review of authorities dealing with evidence of good character, this Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        This line of authority shows that, whilst the primary significance of evidence of good character is upon the unlikelihood of guilt, there is a corollary to the effect that evidence of good character can be used with reference to credibility of the accused in his denial of the charge, and hence the unlikelihood of his guilt. 
        
       
       
      It matters not whether the accused’s denial of the charge is before the jury by way of his or her evidence at the trial or in some other form, such as a recorded interview with police. Of course, whether the jury should be given a direction about character evidence and, if so, what the terms of that direction should be are matters for the trial judge to determine in the light of the issues in the particular case:  
      Melbourne v The Queen 
       (1999) 198 CLR 1. 
       
      
    17 Senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged that, in the circumstances of this case, this ground alone would not be sufficient to warrant setting aside the conviction. As I have said, it is the other ground which determines the outcome of the appeal. I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. 
     
      
    18 HISLOP J: I agree with Hidden J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN AJA: The opponent was admitted to the Roll of Legal Practitioners of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 18 December 1987. He commenced practice as a solicitor but his Practising Certificate was cancelled on 5 June 1998. 
     
      
    2 On 17 December 2003 the Prothonotary filed a summons claiming: 
     
      
       
      1. A declaration that the opponent is guilty of professional misconduct.

    3 The particulars relied upon in the summons were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) That between 17 December 1997 and 22 December 1997 the opponent made a false instrument with intent to induce a person as genuine, contrary to s 300(1)  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (NSW); 
       
       
      (ii) That between 1 May 1998 and 15 May 1998 the opponent made a false instrument with intent to induce a person as genuine, contrary to s 300(1)

      ; 
       
       
      (iii) That between 1 May 1998 and 15 May 1998 the opponent made a false instrument with intent to induce a person as genuine, contrary to s 300(1)  
      Crimes Act 
      ; 
       
       
      (iv) That on or about 22 December 1997 the opponent used a false instrument with intent to induce a person to accept such instrument as genuine, contrary to s 300(2)  
      Crimes Act 
      ; 
       
       
      (v) That on or about 15 May 1998 the opponent used a false instrument with intent to induce a person to accept such instrument as genuine, contrary to s 300(2)  
      Crimes Act 
      ; 
       
       
      (vi) That on or about 15 May 1998 the opponent used false instrument with intent to induce person to accept such instrument as genuine, contrary to s 300(2)  
      Crimes Act 
      . 
       
      
    4 For the purpose of these proceedings, the parties have agreed the relevant facts which have been included in an agreed statement of facts and I substantially adopt in these reasons. 
     
      
    5 The opponent commonly uses the name Nick Milios. However, on 18 December 1987 the opponent was admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales under the name Nicholas Milios. 
     
      
    6 The opponent operated as a sole practitioner from premises at 498 Anzac Parade, Kingsford. In 1996, the opponent acted on behalf of clients who wished to borrow money for short periods. The opponent obtained funds from the clients of other solicitors through a mortgage broker. One such solicitor was Mr James Carter, a principal of Nugent, Wallman and Carter Solicitors. 
     
      
    7 In 1997 the opponent began approaching Mr Carter directly in order to obtain loans on behalf of his clients. The loans were secured by mortgages over real property. 
     
      
    8 On 17 November 1997, the opponent was in possession of the title deeds of two properties owned by Steve and Christine Hardas and their daughter Sandra Hardas, namely, 1219 Botany Road, Mascot and 1-2 O’Rourke Crescent, Eastlakes. The opponent had acted for the Hardas family since 1990 and had acted on their behalf in relation to the purchase of these properties. 
     
      
    9 On 17 November 1997, the opponent approached Mr Carter and requested a loan of $210,000 on behalf of his clients, the Hardas family who were unaware that such a request had been made. 
     
      
    10 On 18 December 1997 Mr Carter prepared the necessary mortgage documents to support the loan. The mortgagee was Peter Schultes, a client of Mr Carter’s. The sum proposed to be loaned was $210,000 and the repayment period was for a term of three months. The property secured by the mortgage was land and a dwelling house at 1219 Botany Road, Mascot owned by Steve and Christine Hardas and their daughter, Sandra. 
     
      
    11 On 18 December 1997 the mortgage documents, including the unsigned mortgage number 3861471B were sent to the opponent. 
     
      
    12 On or about 20 December 1997 the opponent forged the signature of Steve, Christine and Sandra Hardas on the mortgage and other mortgage related documents and then fraudulently purported to witness their signatures. The opponent then returned the falsified documents to Mr Carter and then directed Mr Carter to pay the settlement sum of $210,000 into his trust account. Upon receipt of these documents, Mr Carter provided a bank cheque form the mortgagee in the sum of $210,000 in favour of the opponent’s trust account. 
     
      
    13 On 15 May 1998 a further loan was arranged in favour of Steve, Christine and Sandra Hardas without their knowledge. At the opponent’s request, Mr Carter arranged finance in the sum of $315,000 from a number of his clients. Mr Carter drew up two mortgages, namely a primary mortgage numbered 5074443U and a collateral mortgage numbered 5463549J. The first mortgage secured the Hardas’ family property situated at 1219 Botany Road, Mascot and the second mortgage secured Sandra Hardas’s property situated at 1-2 O’Rourke Crescent, Eastlakes. The sum proposed to be loaned was $315,000 and the term of the loan was 12 months. The unsigned mortgages and related documents were sent to the opponent who then forged the signatures. He forged the signatures of Steve, Christine and Sandra Hardas on the first mortgage (5074443U) and the signature of Sandra Hardas on the second mortgage (5463549J). 
     
      
    14 The opponent then forged the Hardas signatures on the related mortgage documents and fraudulently purported to witness those signatures. These documents were then given to Mr Carter and the sum of $315,000 was advanced. Out of the loan monies of $315,000 the opponent directed the mortgagees to pay Mr Peter Schultes the sum of $212,221.50 thereby discharging the original mortgage (numbered 3861471B). 
     
      
    15 Apart from outstanding legal costs and accrued interest payments the balance of the loan amounting to $97,957.09 was directed by the opponent to be paid to three separate companies, namely, Raztech Holdings Pty Ltd ($42,000), Samyo Enterprises Pty Ltd ($36,000) and Southern Cross Enterprises (NSW) Pty Ltd ($19,957.09). The latter payment was by way of a business loan arranged by the opponent in favour of Charles Boustani, the Director of Southern Cross Enterprises Pty Ltd. Mr Boustani repaid the sum of $15,000 to the opponent. 
     
      
    16 Some time in 1998 the opponent came to the attention of the Law Society of New South Wales. 
     
      
    17 On 20 November 1998 the Supreme Court appointed a receiver, Mr David Watson in respect of some of the opponent’s property. 
     
      
    18 In a statement dated 19 September 2001 Mr Watson noted that the balance of the opponent’s trust account was $1,325,380.99 as at 5 January 1998 which included the original advance of $210,000 for the Hardas mortgage, the subject of charges 1 and 4. Mr Watson was of the view that the advance of $210,000 intermingled with other monies in the opponent’s trust account and was applied by the opponent either in the purchase of shares by Vacentia Pty Limited, a company in respect of which the opponent owned one of three issued shares or was applied by the opponent for the benefit of a vendor of property. 
     
      
    19 On 14 December 1998 Mr Steve Hardas became aware of the mortgages entered into by the opponent. On the following day he reported the matter to the police. 
     
      
    20 The police interviewed the opponent on 25 July 2001. During the interview, the opponent admitted that he had forged the signatures of the Hardas family on the mortgage documents referred to above and that they had no knowledge of the financial arrangements. The opponent agreed that after falsifying the documents he returned them to Mr Carter. He stated that the proceeds of the mortgages were deposited into his trust account. The opponent agreed that he had directed that the balance of the monies advanced on the second occasion, after the original mortgage had been discharged, be paid in favour of Raztech Holdings Pty Limited, Samyo Enterprises and Southern Cross Enterprises. However, he was unable to recall why the payments were made to these companies. The opponent was unable to say whether the original advance of $210,000 formed part of the proceeds used to purchase shares by Vincentia Pty Limited. 
     
      
    21 On 25 July 2001 the opponent was charged by police with six offences, being the offences particularised in the summons in these proceedings. 
     
      
    22 On 11 October 2001 the opponent appeared before the Downing Centre Local Court for committal at which time the opponent pleaded guilty to the said charges and was convicted of each offence. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment, the effect of which was imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of two years. The opponent has served the non-parole period of the sentence and on 11 December 2003 was released on parole. 
     
      
    23 The opponent does not wish to contest the orders and declarations sought by the claimant in the summons filed herein, save for any order in respect of costs. However, when the matter was called this morning, the opponent did not appear. I should have indicated that the statement of agreed facts to which I have previously adverted has been signed by the opponent. However, the opponent has made no submissions to this Court in relation to the relief now sought by the claimant. 
     
      
    24 In Allinson v General Council of Medical Education and Examination [1894] 1 QB 750 Lopes LJ (at 763, with whom Lord Esher MR and Davey LJ agreed) said that ""professional misconduct"" consists of behaviour on the part of the (in this case) legal practitioner; ""which would be reasonably regarded as disgraceful or dishonourable by his professional brethren of good repute and competency.”  
     
      
    25 This test was applied in In re A Solicitor; Ex parte Law Society [1912] 1 KB 302 at 311-312. It has also been applied in relation to barristers of this Court; (see Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Costello [1984] 3 NSWLR 201 per Glass and Samuels JJA at 203. 
     
      
    26 In New South Wales Bar Association v Smith (NSWCA, unreported, 9 May 1991) Samuels JA formulated a test of professional misconduct, being whether the conduct “would reasonably incur the reprobation of professional brethren of good repute and competency.” 
     
      
    27 In the present matter, the opponent engaged in conduct over a period of several months which amounted to a continuous course of fraudulent behaviour. The opponent’s conduct was of a serious criminal nature. On three separate occasions he forged the names and signatures of his own clients in order to create mortgage instruments to fraudulently obtain monies for his own purposes. He has been convicted of relevant offences. The mere fact of a conviction for a criminal offence, although not determinative of the character of the opponent’s conduct, is material which is relevant to the question as to whether he is a fit and proper person to remain on the Roll of Legal Practitioners.  
     
      
    28 The opponent’s clients had invested their trust in him and engaged him in his professional capacity to act in their interests as their solicitor. The opponent has abused this position of trust by wilfully entering into loan and mortgage agreements without the consent of the client. The opponent further abused his position by forging his clients’ signatures in order to complete and execute the mortgage instruments and other associated documents necessary for him to obtain the relevant monies. 
     
      
    29 Apart from defrauding his own clients, the opponent deliberately deceived his fellow practitioner, a solicitor, Mr James Carter, by leading him to believe that the opponent was acting in a bona fide manner on behalf of his clients. The opponent deliberately and dishonestly caused Mr Carter to prepare mortgage documents and then used the fraudulently executed mortgage documents to induce Mr Carter to arrange for his own clients to provide loan monies. 
     
      
    30 I am in no doubt that by his actions the opponent has been guilty of professional misconduct and has demonstrated that he is not of good fame and character (see Ex parte Tziniolis, Re The Medical Practitioners Act [1967] 1 NSWLR 357 at 451; see also Incorporated Law Institute of New South Wales v Meagher (1909) 9 CLR 655 per Higgins J at 692. 
     
      
    31 The High Court considered the conduct of a legal practitioner who had committed criminal acts in In Re: Davis (1947) 75 CLR 414 which was an appeal in relation to the removal of a barrister from the Roll in which Dixon J stated (at 420): 
     
      
       
        
        “It would almost seem to go without saying that conviction of a crime of dishonesty of so grave a kind as housebreaking and stealing is incompatible with the existence of a candidate for admission to the Bar of the reputation and the more enduring moral qualities denoted by the expression, ‘good fame and character,’ which describe the test of his ethical fitness for the profession.” 
        
       
      
    32 The observations in In Re: Davis are applicable to a solicitor, particularly where, as in the present case, the crimes committed are serious crimes of dishonesty.  
     
      
    33 There is no evidence from which it could be concluded that the opponent is reformed. 
     
      
    34 I am also satisfied that the opponent’s conduct demonstrates that he is not a fit and proper person to remain on the Roll of Legal Practitioners. The public are entitled to place their trust and confidence in legal practitioners in the knowledge that they will act in the client’s interest. The public must be protected from persons such as the opponent who pursue their own financial gain by fraudulent means at the expense of the interests of their own clients. Other practitioners must also be deterred from acting in a similar manner. 
     
      
    35 In my opinion it is appropriate for this Court to make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. A declaration that the opponent has been guilty of professional misconduct. 
       
      2. A declaration that the opponent is not a fit and proper person to remain on the Roll of Legal Practitioners of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. 
       
      3. An order that the name of the opponent be, and hereby is, removed from the Roll of Legal Practitioners for the State of New South Wales. 
       
      4. An order that the opponent pay the costs of and incidental to these proceedings. 
       
      
    36 SANTOW JA: I agree. 
     
      
    37 BRYSON JA: I agree with McClellan AJA. 
     
      
    38 SANTOW JA; Accordingly those become the orders of the Court.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPERLING J: The course of the trial is set out in Kirby J’s judgment. 
     
      
    2 Counsel objected to the tender of the alibi notice. In her judgment given on 14 August, her Honour decided that the notice should be admitted as evidence going to the credit of the accused, but not as evidence of consciousness of guilt. That, however, was on the understanding that the accused would both be giving evidence. 
     
      
    3 Immediately following the judgment, counsel said he could give no assurance that the accused would be called. Her Honour’s response was that, if the accused were not called, the jury would be instructed that the notice could be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    4 When the time came for tender of the notice, counsel said that at least one of the accused would be called. That left open the possibility that one would not. It was in these circumstances that her Honour then admitted the notice into evidence but deferred the question of what directions the jury would be given concerning its use.  
     
      
    5 In the event, Solomon Siulai, the appellant’s co-accused, gave evidence. The appellant did not.  
     
      
    6 No further submissions in relation to the alibi notice were made or invited before the summing-up.  
     
      
    7 It is apparent from the summing-up that her Honour had, by then, decided not to direct the jury that the alibi notice could be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt on the part of either of the accused, notwithstanding that the appellant had not been called. It is also apparent from the summing-up that her Honour believed that, having so decided, a direction of the kind referred to in Zoneff (2000) 200 CLR 234 would be appropriate.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The alibi notice should have been excluded 
       
      
    8 The relevant question is, of course, whether the notice should not have been admitted in the Crown case against the appellant. 
     
      
    9 I agree with Kirby J’s view that the notice was admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt and ought to have been so admitted, with the usual Edwards directions. However, that does not justify the admission of the notice into evidence because it was a use which her Honour ultimately intended should not be left to the jury for consideration. 
     
      
    10 However, as Kirby J has said, the alibi notice was relevant and admissible as to credit. Solomon Siulai gave evidence in answer to the Crown case which was not only evidence in his own case, but also evidence in the appellant’s case. It was evidence on which the appellant relied for a different version of events. Solomon Siulai’s evidence was that he was present, but innocently. It followed that the notice was admissible against him pursuant to s106 of the Evidence Act 1995 because the notice was capable of being construed as a statement that he was not present at all. 
     
      
    11 As for the appellant, he did not give evidence but he had told the police, when interviewed, that he had no involvement and could not tell the police anything. The jury were entitled to treat that as evidence of innocence. The alibi notice was then relevant and admissible against him, pursuant to s108A of the Evidence Act, as going to his credit in relation to what he said to the police.  
     
      
    12 It is Kirby J’s opinion that, if the notice was not to be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt, her Honour was bound to exclude the notice altogether in the exercise of her discretion because of the risk that the jury might, unprompted, use the notice as evidence of consciousness of guilt without having received the full Edwards directions in that regard.  
     
      
    13 I assume, without deciding, that there was error in this regard. 
     
      
    14 I then note that, at no stage, either before or at the time of the admission into evidence of the notice, did counsel submit that the notice should not be admitted, even on the limited basis, because of such a risk.  
     
      
    15 The explanation for no submission having been made along those lines is obvious enough. Any such submission could well have precipitated a decision by her Honour that, irrespective of whether the accused or either of them gave evidence, the notice should be admitted as evidence of consciousness of guilt. That was a substantial risk. Not making the submission is explicable as a tactical decision by counsel. (The wisdom of the decision is borne out by what then occurred. The notice was not left to the jury explicitly as evidence of consciousness of guilt, even against the appellant, who did not give evidence, as it should have been and as might well have occurred if the submission had been made.) 
     
      
    16 There can have been no substantial miscarriage of justice by reason of the alibi notice having gone into evidence. The Crown case was overwhelming apart altogether from whatever use the jury might have made of the notice. Mr Stephen’s evidence was credible. Those respects in which it was shown to be inaccurate were not significant. The evidence of the 000 call was compelling. By contrast, Solomon Siulai’s account of events was absurd, as Kirby J has explained. Mr Young was discredited.  
     
      
    17 Kirby J has explained the limited way in which the alibi notice might have been misused as evidence of consciousness of guilt due to lack of the full Edwards directions. 
     
      
    18 In these circumstances, the admission of the alibi notice into evidence cannot have resulted in the appellant losing a chance of acquittal. 
     
      
    19 Rule 4 applies. Having regard to the foregoing considerations, leave should not be given to mount this argument on appeal. 
     
      
    20 There was no other reasonably arguable basis on which it could be said that the notice should have been excluded. 
     
      
    21 For these reasons, Ground 1 fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Her Honour erred in the directions given concerning the use to which the jury should put the evidence of the alibi notice and of denials of guilt by the accused 
       
      
    22 It was common ground on the hearing of the appeal that, because her Honour did not intend to leave the alibi notice to the jury for consideration as evidence of consciousness of guilt, the appropriate direction was that proposed by the High Court in Zoneff. 
     
      
    23 I agree, for the reasons given by Kirby J, that the directions given by her Honour did not conform in all respects with the model direction proposed in that case and that the departure constituted error. 
     
      
    24 However, I agree with Kirby J's opinion that leave to argue this ground of appeal should also be refused under r4, no redirection having been sought and there being no reasonable prospect that the result might have been different but for the error.25 Ground 2 fails. 
     
      
       
      Result 
       
      
    26 For the foregoing reasons, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    27 KIRBY J: On 12 August 2002, Toai Siulai (the appellant) and his brother, Solomon Siulai, stood trial before Latham DCJ and a jury upon the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Count 1 
        : On 4 August 2001 at Mayfield ... he did break and enter the dwelling house ... and whilst therein did commit a serious indictable offence, namely steal ... in circumstances of aggravation in that at the time of the offence Solomon Siulai and Toai Tess Siulai were in the company of another person whose identity is unknown. (s112(2) Crimes Act 1900) 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : On 4 August 2001 at Mayfield ... being in the company of another person whose identity is unknown he did assault Jim Lea Stephens with intent to rob him. (s97 Crimes Act 1990)"" 
        
       
      
    28 Both the appellant and his brother pleaded not guilty to each charge. On 20 August 2002 the jury returned verdicts of guilty against both accused on both counts. 
     
      
    29 In the course of evidence an Alibi Notice was admitted against each accused (Exhibit J). The Grounds of Appeal by the appellant relate to that notice. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The alibi notice, exhibit J, should in all the circumstances of the case (have) been excluded. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Her Honour erred in directions and the use to which the jury should put evidence as to the alibi notice and denials of guilt by the accused. 
        
       
      
    30 The Crown asserted that, even were the Court to find error, there had been no miscarriage of justice. The proviso under s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case. 
       
      
    31 Mr Jim Stephens and his daughters occupied part of a house in Mayfield. The house had been divided into units. At the rear of the premises there was a separate building, which had been converted into a further unit, which was occupied by Mr Earl Young. 
     
      
    32 On the evening of 4 August 2002, Mr Stephens was watching television. At about 11.40 pm he heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there and heard a muffled reply. He then opened the door and was confronted by three men. They forced their way into the house. 
     
      
    33 Mr Stephens said that he recognised one of the men. He described him as ""an islander"", and knew him as Toai. Mr Stephens said this: (T40) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. How many times had you seen him before? 
         
        A. A few occasions. My daughter was friends with a little girl down the road and I think they were related somehow because he was usually there."" 
        
       
      
    34 The second man was also ""an islander"", Toai's brother, Solomon. The third man was caucasian. He was smaller and had tattoos. According to Mr Stephens, Toai pushed him to the door of his bedroom. He then demanded drugs and money. Mr Stephens said that his immediate concern was for the safety of his daughters. He told the men that his wallet was downstairs in his car (although in fact he had no car). 
     
      
    35 The group then moved downstairs. Mr Stephens said that he was dragged by the shirt. The appellant and his brother were much bigger men. As he was passing the entrance to Mr Young's unit, Mr Young emerged. In cross examination Mr Stephens acknowledged that he may have knocked on his door. When Mr Young emerged he was holding a long screwdriver. According to Mr Stephens, Solomon Siulai told Mr Young to mind his own business. At the same time he took hold of the screwdriver, whereupon Mr Young retreated, shutting the door behind him. 
     
      
    36 According to Mr Stephens he then told his assailants that there was money in the laundry. The group moved towards the laundry, at which point Solomon Siulai held Mr Stephens with the screwdriver at his throat. However, at that moment the appellant said that someone was coming. The three then fled. Mr Stephens immediately escaped by jumping through a louvred window. Some of the louvres were broken as he did so. 
     
      
    37 Mr Stephens said that he ran down the street. From a position about four houses away, he hid under a trailer. He then rang 000. The transcript of that call was an exhibit (Exhibit A). The terms of the call were entirely consistent with Mr Stephens' account. He was whispering and in obvious fear. The transcript included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""S. Big tall kiwi blokes, one about 6 foot odd and one about 5 foot odd and one's Australian. 
        
       
       
        
        F. Have you ever seen them before? 
         
        S. Yes 
        
       
       
        
        F. So you know them do you? 
         
        S. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        F. OK. Are they after what money or something from you? 
         
        S. Yes, yes."" 
        
       
      
    38 Within ten minutes a number of police arrived. A search was made of the house to determine whether anything was missing. Two mobile phones had been taken. Mr Stephens gave a brief account to one police officer of what had happened. He later provided a more detailed statement. 
     
      
    39 Later that evening, after the police had left, Mr Stephens heard someone at the front of his house. The person yelled out: ""Dog, don't go to the police"". Mr Stephens said that he was terrified. He again complained to the police. 
     
      
    40 On 13 October 2001 Mr Stephens was shown a series of photographs. They included the appellant, whom he identified. On 19 October 2001 he was shown further photographs. He identified Solomon Siulai. 
     
      
    41 The Crown case depended upon an acceptance of Mr Stephens' evidence. He was cross examined at some length. In various ways, mostly minor, he departed from statements made to the police shortly after the incident. He said, for instance, that at one point the three men were in his bedroom, having entered his flat, whereas his account before the jury suggested that only the appellant was in the bedroom, just inside the threshold. More importantly, Mr Stephens said to a police officer on the night of the incident that, having been marched downstairs, he was ""forced against the vehicle"" in the carpark with a 12 inch screwdriver against his throat. His account before the jury suggested that the assault with the screwdriver occurred inside the premises. It had not involved a car. 
     
      
    42 The daughters of Mr Stephens were called. They did not add greatly to the picture. One had seen her father downstairs with three men. 
     
      
    43 When the appellant was arrested on 13 October 2001 he sought legal advice. He thereafter (as recorded on a video interview) declined to be interviewed. He also declined to participate in an identification parade. The video interview by Det Snr Const Irwin included the following introduction, describing the matter under investigation: (ERISP 1) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q4 As I have already explained to you, Detective Morley and I are making inquiries in relation to a home invasion at Unit 1, Number 2, Silsoe Street, Mayfield, on the 4th of August, 2001..."" 
        
       
      
    44 The brief formal interview included the following: (ERISP 4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q28 OK. Do you agree that you did not wish to be interviewed in relation to this matter as in your own words, you weren't involved? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q29 OK. So, hang on. Do you agree that the reasons why you are, didn't wish to be interviewed about the matter were that you had no involvement so you couldn't tell us anything? 
         
        A. Yeah."" 
        
       
       
      The Alibi Notice. 
       
      
    45 As mentioned, the offence occurred on 4 August 2001. Solomon Siulai was arrested on 8 October 2001 and his brother, Toai (the appellant), on 13 October 2001. Both were in custody at the time of the committal in Newcastle on 11 December 2001. Mr Graham of counsel was briefed to appear at the committal. Having spoken to each accused, the matter proceeded as a paper committal. Both were committed for trial. 
     
      
    46 On 13 December 2001, Mr Graham wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""These accused have been committed for trial and are to appear on arraignment on 31.1.02. 
        
       
       
        
        Please note that both intend to rely on alibis as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        (a)  
        Toai Siulai 
         
        States that he was at the relevant time at home at 33 Margaret St, Tighes Hill. He will call Laine Gostini of that address in support. He only states this to the best of his belief. I have been unable to contact Ms Gostini to verify this and am informed that she may be on holiday in Queensland. If I am able to obtain further information I will immediately advise you. 
        
       
       
        
        (b)  
        Solomon Siulai 
         
        States that he is fairly sure he was at home with his wife, Caroline Puru, and his 2 yr old son, 334 Ridley St, Charlestown. He intends to call Ms Puru in support of this."" 
        
       
      
    47 During the trial, the appellant, on the advice of counsel, made an admission in these terms (s184 Evidence Act 1995): 
     
      
       
        
        ""On 4th August, 2001 at about 11.40 pm Toai Tess Siulai attended the residence at Flat 1/2 Silsoe Street, Mayfield and spoke to Jim Lea Stephens."" 
        
       
      
    48 The appellant's brother, Solomon, made a corresponding admission. 
     
      
    49 The Crown thereafter sought, as part of its case, to tender the Alibi Notice. Objection was taken on behalf of each accused. The notice was, however, admitted against both accused (Exhibit J). 
     
      
       
      The Defence Case. 
       
      
    50 The appellant, Toai Siulai, did not give evidence. His brother, Solomon, however, did so. He said that he, his brother and a caucasian male, Brendon Panowitz, went to Mr Stephens' home late on 4 August 2001. They knocked on the door, which was then opened by Mr Stephens. Toai Siulai said this: (T226) 
     
      
       
        
        ""We are here to talk to you about certain things that have been going on in the area."" 
        
       
      
    51 In cross examination there was an elaboration: (T241) 
     
      
       
        
        ""We are here to talk to you concerning a neighbour who's name is Kelly Walters as she has made complaints to junkies being in the area, syringes laying around, also prostitutes being around and that's at all hours of the day."" 
        
       
      
    52 Mr Stephens responded by suggesting that they go downstairs and talk. They moved to the garage area, which he described as a large empty area (of which there were a number of photographs). As they walked through this area they passed a door. It was the door to the unit of Mr Stephens' neighbour, Mr Earl Young. Mr Stephens knocked on the door. Mr Young emerged. He was then asked by Mr Stephens: ""Can we come into your house?"" Mr Young refused. He attempted to close the door but could not do so because the appellant had placed his foot in the door. Mr Young then picked up a screwdriver, pointing it in the direction of Toai Siulai. Toai Siulai stepped back. He said that he did not want trouble. 
     
      
    53 Mr Stephens, at this point, asked Earl Young for the keys to the back laundry, which Mr Young then gave him. Mr Stephens, the appellant and Solomon then moved to an area in the vicinity of the laundry, where they continued their conversation. There had been complaints about drug users in the laneway which children used to get to school. Syringes had been left in the laneway.  
     
      
    54 Part way through this conversation, Solomon Siulai walked away, returning to Mr Young's unit. According to his testimony, he then shared a cup of coffee with Mr Young for about 15 minutes. They then left the unit, walking towards the laundry where they again saw Mr Stephens and Toai Siulai. Mr Stephens did not look happy. Indeed, he appeared uneasy. Solomon Siulai heard his brother (the appellant) make the following comment to Mr Stephens as they parted: (T231) 
     
      
       
        
        ""To snap out of it, with what's going on, because of the children and that within the area and also not to forget the rubbish, meaning the syringes."" 
        
       
      
    55 Solomon Siulai denied having threatened Mr Stephens, or having held a screwdriver to his throat. He did not hear anyone threaten Mr Stephens. Neither his brother (the appellant) nor Mr Panowitz entered Mr Stephens' home. They had gone directly downstairs to have their discussion. No property had been taken from Mr Stephens' unit. 
     
      
    56 Mr Solomon Siulai also gave evidence concerning the Alibi Notice. He saw his counsel, Mr Graham, for the first time in December 2001, on the morning of the committal. They met in the interview area below the court. At that stage he had not seen the police brief. However, in the course of the day he did see the brief. His conference with counsel lasted no more than eight minutes. The offence was described as a home invasion. Counsel simply asked whether he and his brother had been ""there"". Solomon Siulai told counsel that he had not been there. He did not do it. They then discussed an application for bail. At no time was he shown the Alibi Notice. 
     
      
    57 The neighbour, Mr Earl Young, was then called in the defence case. He leased the back flat, which he had occupied for a short time before this incident, a matter of weeks. He had recently separated from his wife. Late on the evening of 4 August 2001, Mr Stephens knocked on his door. He asked if he could use the unit. Mr Young said he could not. He gave an account of having produced a screwdriver, which corresponded with that given by Solomon Siulai. Mr Stephens then asked to use the laundry. Mr Young provided a key. They then left. 
     
      
    58 Soon after Solomon Siulai returned to his unit. They had a cup of coffee in the kitchen. From the kitchen he could see Toai Siulai and Mr Stephens talking in the laundry. Nothing unusual happened during that conversation. He heard no raised voices. Later they all walked towards the front of the house and said goodbye. 
     
      
    59 When cross examined, Mr Young acknowledged that, at the time of these events, he was experiencing a major depression. He was going through a ""very messy divorce"". He said he had known Solomon Siulai a couple of weeks, although he had known of him for much longer. He was reminded of the terms of his police statement in which he had told the police he had known Solomon Siulai for eight years, which he denied (T270). He acknowledged that some months after the incident, and before he went to the police to make a statement (in January 2002), he met both brothers at the Cessnock Correctional Centre where he was an inmate. He denied that he was giving an untruthful account to assist each of the accused. 
     
      
    60 Mr Young was shown photographs of the premises. He agreed that he could not see the laundry from the kitchen. He said that he must have seen them talking when he went to the toilet. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The admissibility of the Alibi Notice. 
       
      
    61 A Voir Dire was undertaken in respect of the admissibility of the Alibi Notice. Mr Graham of counsel was called as a witness. The notes he had taken on 11 December 2001, during his conferences with Toai and Solomon Siulai, were tendered. None of this material ultimately found its way into evidence before the jury. The argument proceeded upon an assumption by her Honour and the Crown that both accused would give evidence. Counsel made a statement suggesting such a course early in the proceedings. Adopting that assumption, her Honour gave judgment, ruling that the Alibi Notice was admissible in the Crown case, and adding: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I can see on that basis, no relevant unfairness or unfair prejudice within the terms of s90, 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act which would cause me to exercise my discretion to exclude the alibi notice from evidence in the Crown case."" 
        
       
      
    62 Her Honour then turned to whether a limitation upon the use of the document should be imposed under s136 of the Evidence Act 1995. She said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is, however, an issue to deal with, that is, the limit to which use of that evidence should be placed upon the Crown and if one looks to the terms of s136 of the Evidence Act, that provides that evidence may be limited in terms of its use if there is a danger that a particular use might be unfairly prejudicial. The particular use which the Crown seeks to make of the alibi notice is to allow the jury to use it as a lie going to consciousness of guilt, that is in proof of the charge brought by the Crown against each of the accused. In my view there is some unfair prejudice in that particular use by the jury of the alibi. That is because the issue in this trial has now resolved itself into whether or not Mr Stephens was robbed in the circumstances described by him by the accused or whether in fact the accused merely called upon Stephens to discuss matters which, according to the accused, included Mr Stephen's alleged drug dealing. In view of the fact that the issue in the trial really does not turn on the accused's presence on the evening in question or the movements from the house to the shed at the rear of the premises, I propose to limit the use which the Crown might make of the alibi notice and I propose to limit it to the issue of credit."" 
        
       
      
    63 Her Honour said that such a course would not infringe the credibility rule, since that rule does not apply where the evidence ""tends to prove that a witness made a prior inconsistent statement"" (s106 Evidence Act 1995). 
     
      
    64 Having given judgment, the following exchange then occurred between counsel appearing for both accused (Mr Stewart) and her Honour: (T187/8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""STEWART: Just one issue your Honour. If this evidence is only to be admitted on the issue of credit, there is an issue as to whether it should be allowed to be tendered on the Crown case because ... 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Well I know that, that is why, I mean I did discuss whether or not it would be proper to allow the Crown to split its case because the convention is, if the Crown has notice then all of these matters should be tendered in the Crown case. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Yes I was just concerned that at this point in time credit is not in issue, the credit of the accused is not in issue and if it was going to be allowed to be used for the issue of guilt or innocence, well clearly it would be able to be tendered in the Crown case but if it is used as evidence in regard of the credit of the accused, at this point of the trial, during the Crown case the credit of the accused is not in issue."" 
        
       
      
    65 The discussion continued in these terms: (T189) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HER HONOUR: Mr Stewart let's cut to the chase shall we, you indicated at the beginning of the trial that both your clients were going to give evidence. Are you resiling from that position? 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Your Honour it's a matter that I'm reconsidering. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Well you see all of these rulings were made on the basis that the Crown was on notice and you indicated, and certainly without any prompting from me, you indicated that both your clients would be giving evidence."" 
        
       
      
    66 There followed a discussion between her Honour and counsel. In the course of that discussion the following was said by her Honour: (T189/190) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HER HONOUR:  
        So if you were to take the position that your clients would not be called, then I would take the position that the evidence of the alibi notice was admissible and would be capable of use by the Crown as a lie going to consciousness of guilt because in the absence of any contrary version the issue before the jury is not one of credit 
        , really, it is one - it comes back to whether or not the Crown has proved its case through Mr Stephens. 
        
       
       
        
        You see I was - my ruling was entirely premised on the fact that at the end of the day the jury would have evidence of a conversation that your clients had with Mr Stephens which was entirely of a different nature. And that's why I made a ruling to the effect that the issue of this trial would turn substantially upon the credit of Mr Stephens because they would have a contrary version with which to contrast Mr Stephens' evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        And that's why I said that the alibi notice on that basis would only be properly capable, or would only be fairly capable of being used by the jury on the question of credit. But if your clients don't give evidence, where's the evidence - where is the evidence of the competing account? 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: You can't have it both ways can you? You can't go to the jury and say look in fact Mr Stephens - well you can go to the jury and say Mr Stephens is a liar, and you wouldn't believe him, but you can't go to the jury and say Mr Stephens is a liar and what's more my clients have explained to you what in fact happened that night. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: No, I appreciate that I couldn't say that. Because the matters that I put to him were not adopted. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: I would be in a position where I would merely say that you would not accept his version beyond a reasonable doubt. But your Honour had indicated to me that ... 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: In which event ... it would then be a matter for the jury whether or not the alibi notice was a lie going to consciousness of guilt because they'd have no other explanation for the alibi notice. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Yes. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: You see that's the problem. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: If your Honour allowed that to be admitted, yes. And your Honour has indicated what your position would be and I will take that on board."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    67 The trial then continued. Detective Irwin was called and, in the absence of the jury, there was a further discussion concerning the admission of the Alibi Notice. It was in these terms: (T210/11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HER HONOUR: Well we need to determine the tender of the alibi notice. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I've got to tender that before I finish in chief because I want to ask the police officer about the investigations. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: About the investigations. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: All right, well, Mr Stewart, when the alibi notice is tendered I'm going to have to give some direction to the jury so what is the position? Have you determined whether or not your clients are going to go into evidence or not? 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: At least one will. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: At least one will. Does that mean only one will? 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Well, your Honour the ruling or the ruling that you foreshadow ... 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR:  
        Well I've made a ruling, the ruling is the alibi notice is going in. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: The only issue is how is the Crown permitted to use it. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Yes, yes, I understand. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: If you want me to defer giving them directions about that until at the end of the trial then I will. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Yes, I'd prefer that at this stage, well no, no, so your Honour would be indicating that you would be directing the jury that it would be evidence that goes to the guilt or innocence of ... 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR:  
        Well I'm not going to give the full  
        Edwards 
         direction now, I will be giving it in the course of the summing-up, if I give it. The only reason that I would say anything at all to the jury would be to prevent them from speculating about the use of the alibi notice as anything other than going to the credit of - I would be limiting the use to which the jury can put the alibi notice if it was the case that your clients were going to be giving evidence of their account. 
         But look, I don't think that I can safely say anything at this stage because I don't think the position is clear. So I think we'll just have to let the Crown tender the alibi notice through the Detective, and when we know what the position is I'll give the appropriate directions at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: Perhaps your Honour could indicate to the jury that you will be giving directions as to the use that can be made of this ... 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Yes I will, I'll say that, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        STEWART: At the time of the tender. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: At the appropriate time. Yes."" 
        
       
       (emphasis added) 
       
      
    68 Counsel for the appellant had no objection to the Alibi Notice being tendered in the Crown case in chief (T214) (see also: supra para 64). The Alibi Notice was then tendered (Exhibit J). Her Honour said this to the jury: (T214/15) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HER HONOUR: Yes, I'll read it. Ladies and gentlemen I'll give you some directions later on about the use to which the alibi notice might be put. It's referred to as an alibi notice because there's a provision in the laws of this State to the effect that if accused persons wish to raise alibi evidence then they should notify the authorities so the authorities have a chance to make inquiries based on that notice. Anyway this alibi notice reads on the letterhead of Jeffrey J Graham, Barrister, dated 13 December 2001. 
        
       
       
        
        EXHIBIT J READ TO JURY."" 
        
       
      
    69 Thereafter Solomon Siulai, but not Toai Siulai (the appellant), gave evidence. In doing so he provided a version which Toai Siulai could also rely upon. Her Honour then summed up, attempting to confine the relevance of the Alibi Notice to the issue of credit, as she had foreshadowed in her judgment. 
     
      
    70 On this appeal it was submitted that the Alibi Notice should have been excluded, so far as the appellant was concerned, upon the following bases (as set out in the written submissions): 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""1. it was not relevant 
        
       
       
        
        2. it was likely to be misused by the jury 
        
       
       
        
        3. it was by its nature and contents equivocal 
        
       
       
        
        4. it was not a statement of the appellant but hearsay in nature 
        
       
       
        
        5. it has not been adopted by the appellant 
        
       
       
        
        6. it was likely to divert the jury from the issues in the trial the accused having made an admission as to his attendance at the premises"" 
        
       
      
    71 Alternatively, it was suggested the notice should have been limited to an attack upon the credit of Solomon Siulai. 
     
      
    72 The notice was plainly relevant. It was capable of being regarded as a deliberate lie told through a consciousness of guilt (Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193). If accepted as a lie, it was an attempt to provide a false alibi. It was also (if accepted as a lie) capable of affecting the credibility of Toai Siulai (in the section of the notice dealing with his whereabouts) and the credit of Solomon Siulai (in that part of the notice dealing with his whereabouts). The admissibility of the notice did not depend upon it having been expressly adopted by the appellant. The notice had been given by Mr Graham of counsel. There was a rebuttable presumption that the notice had been given with the authority of the accused (s48(6) Criminal Procedure Act 1986). 
     
      
    73 The notice in each case included a qualification. In the case of Toai Siulai that qualification was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(a)  
        Toai Siulai 
         
        States that he was at the relevant time at home at 33 Margaret St, Tighes Hill. He will call Laine Gostini of that address in support.  
        He only states this 
          
        to the best of his belief 
        . ..."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    74 No doubt it was a jury question whether a notice in these terms could be regarded as a deliberate lie. That issue did not render the document irrelevant.  
     
      
    75 The Alibi Notice was a statement by the appellant (made through his agent) which included a representation as to his whereabouts ""at the relevant time"". It was hearsay if tendered to prove the truth of that representation. However the Crown had in mind a different purpose (cf s60 Evidence Act). The statement was not tendered for its truth. Rather, the Crown sought to contrast the admission made by the appellant in the course of the trial (acknowledging his presence at Mr Stephens' home late on the evening of 4 August 2001) with the assertion in the notice that he had been elsewhere. It was arguably a statement inconsistent with that admission. 
     
      
    76 Should the notice have been excluded under the discretion given in s135 or s137 of the Evidence Act, or limited by s136? Her Honour thought that, because both accused ultimately acknowledged their presence at Mr Stephen's home, that unfair prejudice would attend the use of the notice as a lie told with a consciousness of guilt. With respect, I disagree. In my view, notwithstanding the admission, the Crown was entitled to prove the lie and assert that it was told with a consciousness of guilt. The appellant had made the representation in the Alibi Notice at a time that he had been apprised of the allegations against him. He had responded by asserting a belief that he was elsewhere. That was very different from saying that he was there, but that nothing of the kind alleged by Mr Stephens had taken place. In my view the notice had significant probative value, notwithstanding the qualification. It was, as I have said, capable of being regarded as a false alibi. 
     
      
    77 Unfair prejudice arises where there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way, by, for instance, provoking an irrational or emotional response, or, where it is liable to be given more weight than it deserves (Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297, per McHugh J at 325, quoting Hunt CJ at CL in R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139).  
     
      
    78 Here, there was no unfair prejudice in the admission of the notice as a document capable of being regarded as a lie told with a consciousness of guilt. In my view, there was no basis to exclude the notice, either under s135 or s137, nor (on the basis of unfair prejudice) to confine its use to the issue of credibility. 
     
      
    79 Accepting that her Honour did not deal with the notice in that way, should the notice have been admitted where it was confined to the issue of credit? Part 3.7 of the Evidence Act deals with evidence relevant to credibility. Such evidence is not admissible (s102 Evidence Act), unless it falls within one of a number of defined exceptions. Her Honour referred to the exception created by s106(c) where the credibility rule does not apply to evidence tending to prove that a witness has made a prior inconsistent statement. She did so at a time when it was assumed that both accused would give evidence. That exception justified the reception of that part of the notice dealing with Solomon Siulai, who was a witness. However, the appellant did not give evidence. He was not a witness. Section 106 had no application to him. Nonetheless, the following provision of the Evidence Act, in my view, justified the reception of the notice against the appellant in relation to his credibility, subject to the discretion under s135 and s137, and assuming always that there was an issue as to his credibility.  
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        s108A  
          
        Admissibility of evidence of credibility of person who has made a previous representation 
         
         
        (1) If: 
         
          
          (a) because of a provision of Part 3.2, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation; and 
           
          (b) evidence of the representation has been admitted; and 
           
          (c) the person who made the representation has not been called, and will not be called, to give evidence in the proceeding;

        (2) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard in deciding whether the evidence has substantial probative value, it is to have regard to: 
         
          
          (a) whether the evidence tends to prove that the person who made the representation knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the person was under an obligation to tell the truth; and 
           
          (b) the period that elapsed between the doing of the acts or the occurrence of the events to which the representation related and the making of the representation.""  
          
         
        
       
      
    80 However, since the appellant did not give evidence, was his credibility an issue? It will be remembered that the appellant's response to Det Snr Const Irwin in the video interview, included the following: (ERISP 4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q29 OK. So, hang on. Do you agree that the reasons why you are, didn't wish to be interviewed about the matter were  
        that you had no involvement so you couldn't tell us anything? 
         
        A. Yeah.""  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    81 Although brief, that was a version from the appellant which the jury may add to any doubt which may exist as to his guilt. Even if Toai Siulai did not give evidence, during the Crown case it was clear that his credibility would be an issue. The admissibility of the Alibi Notice was not dependent upon him giving evidence.  
     
      
       
      Discretion to exclude. 
       
      
    82 Should the evidence, if admitted upon the basis of credibility, have been excluded as being unfairly prejudicial? There were a number of difficulties in approaching the issue as one going only to credit. The Crown cannot split its case (Shaw v The Queen (1952) 85 CLR 365; Killick v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 565; The Queen v Chin (1985) 157 CLR 671; and Soma v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 299). It must present such evidence as it intends to rely upon in chief before the accused can be called upon to decide the course he intends to follow (Soma v The Queen (supra) Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at 309-310). If the Crown intends to rely upon statements by the accused which are relevant and incriminatory, they must be proved in chief. Only in very exceptional circumstances will the Crown be permitted a case in reply. In this context, relevantly, that required proof that at the time of the notice Mr Graham had been retained as Toai Siulai's counsel, that he had taken instructions from him, and that the notice had been sent to the prosecuting authority. 
     
      
    83 Where evidence simply goes to credit, there is, during the Crown case, one aspect which may present an inhibition to the tender of such evidence. The Crown cannot know, at that point, whether the accused will give evidence. If the accused were to give evidence, then obviously the credibility of his version would need to be determined by the jury. The fact that he made a prior inconsistent statement may be relevant to that issue. In these circumstances, before the close of the Crown case, it may (as happened here) invite the accused to disclose whether he intends to give evidence, to enable a ruling to be made. However, the accused may or may not make that disclosure. In many cases the accused may not know whether he will give evidence before the close of the Crown case. If the accused is invited to make a disclosure, and either refuses or is unable to say what he will do, that will be relevant to whether the Crown is permitted a case in reply. 
     
      
    84 However, the real difficulty in treating the notice as being relevant only to credibility was the nature of the alleged lie. It was a lie (or was capable of being so regarded) in respect of a central issue, namely the appellant's presence at the scene on the night of the home invasion. It was, as stated, capable of being regarded as a false alibi. That really is not a credibility issue. If it was a lie, it betrayed a consciousness of guilt. It would be difficult for a jury not to so regard it. If they were to find that the notice was a deliberate lie, there was a real risk that they would misuse that finding as evidence from which guilt may be inferred. On the issue of credibility, therefore, there was the danger of unfair prejudice. It outweighed the probative value. If the notice were confined to the issue of credibility, it should, in my view, have been excluded under s137. 
     
      
    85 On this basis, I would be prepared to find error. However, the issue having evolved in the way described, and the appellant having elected not to give evidence, no application was made to exclude the Alibi Notice from the evidentiary material available against the appellant. Rule 4 applies. I will postpone, for the moment, a consideration of whether leave to appeal should be given. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The directions on the Alibi Notice. 
       
      
    86 The Crown made the following submission upon the Alibi Notice in his final address: (T313) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I'd suggest to you, members of the jury, that the alibi notice is a pathetic attempt by them to put themselves away from the scene of the crime. They've later realised it wasn't going to work. Mr Stephens had identified them. They had to come up with plan B, and that's what Solomon Siulai has said in this Court."" 
        
       
      
    87 Her Honour dealt with Solomon Siulai's credibility in her summing up, he having given evidence. She drew the jury's attention to the issue of whether the statement in the Alibi Notice, qualified as it was, could be regarded as a lie. She said this: (S/U 11-12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Can I just say something further whilst I am on the subject of Mr Solomon Siulai's credibility. You will recall, as I said, that the Crown Prosecutor cross examined Mr Siulai and in effect suggested that he was telling a pack of lies in his evidence. In particular, the Crown Prosecutor suggested that Mr Solomon Siulai's instructions to his then counsel in October of 2001, that he was at home with his defacto spouse on the evening of 4 August, was obviously a lie because it is clear that he is now admitting that he was at the premises on that night. Can I just say this. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies, either then when he said that he was at home, or now when he acknowledges that he was there, albeit that something entirely different from Mr Stephen's account occurred. So you make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies, and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is important that you take into account that it may not have been in Mr Solomon Siulai's mind to deliberately lie in establishing through the alibi notice, that he was with his defacto spouse. You will recall that there was some submissions made about the fact that he never asserted with absolute certainty that he was at home with his defacto spouse, but that it was expressed in terms of, 'I'm fairly sure'."" 
        
       
      
    88 Her Honour then gave directions as to the significance of the lie, if the jury were to so find: (S/U 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""But in any event, you will determine whether or not you think that that was a lie and whether it was deliberately told. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies might have in relation to the issues in the case. But the point I am making about all of this is that it is very important that you do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something that that is evidence of guilt. It does not automatically follow that just because a person lies, therefore he is guilty of the offence with which he has been charged."" 
        
       
      
    89 Immediately thereafter her Honour dealt with the Alibi Notice. Her directions substantially mirrored the directions already given in respect of the credibility of Solomon Siulai, as set out above. She said this: (S/U 12-13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The same caution should be used when you consider the significance of the alibi notice, which is an exhibit in the trial, and it is evidence against both of the accused. So both of the accused in that sense gave instructions to their legal representative that resulted in that alibi notice being sent to the Crown in mid-December 2001. Can I just, at the risk of repetition, indicate that the Crown relies on the alibi notice in order to suggest that if each of the accused were prepared to offer the alibi in December, it demonstrates a preparedness on their part to give a deliberately false account. The Crown says that you now know it was a false account because they have made a formal admission, which again is an exhibit in this trial, that they were both at the premises that night, albeit for a different purpose than had been alleged by the Crown."" 
        
       
      
    90 Her Honour then dealt with the significance of a lie, if that is what the jury found, in respect of a particular accused. She said this: (S/U 13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""If you were to conclude that the alibi notice was, in effect, a deliberately false account, and that is a matter for you, then you may think it has some significance. But again, I warn you, do not automatically conclude that either or both of the accused are guilty of one or both of these charges just because they may have told an untruth on some prior occasion."" 
        
       
      
    91 The only other direction given by her Honour, which was directly relevant to the Alibi Notice, was the following: (S/U 17) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Could I just indicate, and I have said this already, that the alibi notice which is an exhibit in the trial, that is evidence against both of the accused. It is available to you in the way that the Crown has suggested, namely, the Crown says that the alibi notice is evidence of the accused, both of the accused, being prepared to give an account which is subsequently proved to be false, and proved to be false by the admissions that they made where with respect to their presence at Mr Stephens' house on 4 August 2001."" 
        
       
      
    92 In dealing with the arguments of counsel, her Honour again referred to the Crown position in these terms: (S/U 40) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Of course the Crown says that you will take into account the fact that these accused, in terms of the alibi notice, have given a false account of their movements on some prior occasion."" 
        
       
      
    93 At the end of the summing up, her Honour invited submissions from counsel on any redirections sought. The following exchange took place with counsel for the appellant: (S/U 43) 
     
      
       
        
        ""STEWART: Nothing in law. ... Your Honour, one matter which arose in cross examination when my learned friend was questioning Mr Solomon Siulai in regard to the alibi notice, one important matter which I'd submit arose which was bearing on his mind when he was considering this during the conference, that he was thinking that he wasn't involved in a home invasion. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Well you have heard that, ladies and gentlemen, so that may be an explanation that you wish to take into account."" 
        
       
      
    94 Had the Alibi Notice been tendered as material from which the jury could infer a lie told with a consciousness of guilt, a direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (supra) would have been required. Such a direction requires that the jury are told that they must be satisfied that the accused told a deliberate lie. The lie must relate to a material issue (that is, it must be concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence), and must be a lie told in circumstances where the explanation for the lie was that the accused knew that the truth would implicate him in the offence (Edwards v The Queen (supra) at 210). Such a direction should be accompanied by an elaboration on the last of these requirements, along the following lines (Edwards v The Queen (supra)): ( at 211) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Moreover, the jury should be instructed that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realization of guilt (see eg  
        Lonergan v The Queen 
         [1963] Tas SR 158 at p 160;  
        Broadhurst v The Queen  
        [1964] A C at p 457). A lie may be told out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence extraneous to the offence. The jury should be told that, if they accept that a reason of that kind is the explanation for the lie, they cannot regard it as an admission."" 
        
       
      
    95 The direction by her Honour plainly did not satisfy those requirements. It was not intended to do so. Her Honour had already ruled that the Alibi Notice should not be received as a matter from which the jury (if they found the lie) might use the lie as evidence from which guilt could be inferred. 
     
      
    96 It was common ground during the hearing of this appeal that, having finally limited the Alibi Notice to the issue of credibility, her Honour should have given the direction suggested by the High Court in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 (the ""Zoneff direction""). 
     
      
    97 It was asserted by the Crown, and denied by the appellant, that the directions in fact given by her Honour reproduced the ""Zoneff direction"". Zoneff was, as the Court said, an unusual case. The accused represented himself. He was cross examined by the Crown. On various issues, the Crown suggested that he was lying. However, the cross examination neither expressly nor by implication suggested that the lies had been told through a consciousness of guilt. Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said, in these circumstances, that it was unnecessary, and indeed undesirable, that a direction of the kind with which Edwards was concerned should be given (p245 para 20). In Zoneff, the trial Judge was, apparently, concerned that there may be a serious risk that the jury might engage in an impermissible process of reasoning were they to conclude that Mr Zoneff had lied (p245 para 22). To address that concern, their Honours suggested the following direction: (p245 para 23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt."" 
        
       
      
    98 Although her Honour plainly had that direction in mind, she departed from the formulation in a number of respects. When dealing with the evidence of Solomon Siulai (supra: para 87) her Honour accurately reproduced the ""Zoneff direction"", but then added these words: (S/U 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It does not automatically follow that just because a person lies, therefore he is guilty of the offence with which he has been charged."" 
        
       
      
    99 The additional words may suggest that in some circumstance (not defined), you may infer guilt from the lie. If that occurred, then such a direction would have been misleading because it did not conform with the limitations her Honour had imposed upon the relevance of the notice, namely, that it went only to the issue of credibility. An inference directly from the notice (assumed to be a lie) to the guilt of the accused would be appropriate only where the lie was capable of being regarded as one told through a consciousness of guilt (assuming there is other evidence to support such an inference). The additional words, however, on one view, are not very different from the formulation suggested by the majority in Zoneff (""that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something that is evidence of guilt""). In respect of the directions given concerning the Alibi Notice, in the context of Solomon Siulai, I would not find error. 
     
      
    100 Moving to the directions given in respect of the Alibi Notice itself (Exhibit J), her Honour referred to the Crown's contention that the Alibi Notice demonstrated a preparedness by each accused to give a deliberately false account of his whereabouts. In Zoneff the High Court suggested the jury should be told that if they found the accused had lied, they should then decide the significance of such lies, having regard to the issues in the trial. Her Honour, on the other hand, said this: (S/U 13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""If you were to conclude that the alibi notice was, in effect, a deliberately false account, and that is a matter for you,  
        then you may think it has some significance. 
        "" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    101 The direction which followed did not include the words which had been given moments before (in the context of the credibility of Solomon Siulai) which were important, and which were taken directly from Zoneff, namely: (S/U 12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""But the point I am making about all of this is that it is very important that you do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something that that is evidence of guilt."" 
        
       
      
    102 Instead, her Honour made the following statement, again arguably leaving open the possibility of consciousness of guilt reasoning. She said: (S/U 13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""But again, I warn you, do not automatically conclude that either or both of the accused are guilty of one or both of these charges just because they may have told an untruth on some prior occasion."" 
        
       
      
    103 The issue of credibility was different in the case of each accused. The direction, with respect, did not identify the different ways in which the issue arose. Solomon Siulai had given evidence but had not provided an interview, whereas Toai Siulai had provided a brief interview but had not given evidence. If the lies were relevant simply to credibility, and the jury determined that a particular accused had lied, then the lie could only be used in determining whether the version of that accused was to be believed. If he were not believed, his evidence should be put to one side. The question would still remain: has the Crown proved its case beyond reasonable doubt? The jury could not, as a matter of reasoning, move directly from a determination that there was a lie to an inference of guilt. 
     
      
    104 The direction did not, to my mind, conform with these requirements. Error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
       
      Application of Rule 4. 
       
      
    105 Accordingly, two errors have been demonstrated, one in respect to the admission of the Alibi Notice, (by not excluding it once its use had been limited to the issue of credibility), and the other in respect of the directions given concerning that notice in the summing up. 
     
      
    106 Counsel for the appellant (then also appearing for his brother, Solomon) certainly objected to the admission of the Alibi Notice. He interrupted his cross examination of the main Crown witness, Mr Stephens, to announce the admissions which each accused was prepared to make, namely that they were at the premises at the relevant time (T86) (Exhibit 1). It was within that context, and on the assumption that both accused would be called to give evidence, that her Honour determined that the Alibi Notice should be admitted but limited to the issue of credibility (supra para 62). 
     
      
    107 Unquestionably that was a very favourable ruling from the viewpoint of each accused. Having obtained that ruling, counsel then indicated his uncertainty as to whether either accused would give evidence (supra para 65). He questioned whether their credibility would be relevant if they were not called. Her Honour responded by saying that if they were not called, the notice may be admitted on the basis of consciousness of guilt (supra para 66). There the matter was left, to be revisited, if the need arose, once counsel had determined the course his clients wished to take. 
     
      
    108 In the result, Solomon Siulai gave evidence but not the appellant. Yet counsel did not, at that point, return to the issue of the Alibi Notice, and its relevance to Toai Siulai (the appellant). No application was made to have the notice excluded, so far as the evidence against the appellant was concerned. He did not suggest that the appellant's credibility was not, relevantly, an issue, nor that the admission of the Alibi Notice might give rise to unfair prejudice, in that the jury may impermissibly use it as a basis for consciousness of guilt reasoning (cf s137) (supra para 84). 
     
      
    109 It is instructive to enquire what might have happened had counsel made an application to exclude the notice from the case against the appellant. Her Honour had already foreshadowed her likely response (supra para 66). She had said, admittedly in the context of a suggestion that neither accused may give evidence, that, in that event, she would permit the Crown to use the notice as evidence of consciousness of guilt. In that context, the appellant had elected not to give evidence. 
     
      
    110 Rule 4 of the Court of Criminal Appeal Rules provides that no direction (or omission to direct) or decision as to the admission or the rejection of evidence shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction or decision. It has been said that the Rule is not a ""mere technicality which may be simply brushed aside"" (Hunt J in R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536). In R v Moussa (2001) 125 A Crim R 505, Howie J said this: (at 521) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It may well be the case that, if the failure to seek a direction or warning was a result of a considered and competent decision made for tactical reasons, it would be virtually impossible for the appellant to obtain leave to rely upon the point because no miscarriage of just could have occurred."" 
        
       
      
    111 The Court is often provided with an affidavit from counsel who appeared at the trial, explaining decisions made in the course of the trial. Indeed, Sully J in R v Hines (1991) 24 NSWLR 737 said this: (at 743) 
     
      
       
        
        ""For my own part, I consider that it should become the fixed practice of this Court that in a case where the person who is to appear for the appellant on the hearing of the appeal did not appear for the appellant at the trial, there should be filed an affidavit which puts before this Court such explanation as it might be desired to advance for the failure to take, at the proper time and in the proper form, at trial an objection upon which it is sought to rely on the hearing of the appeal. I feel very strongly that a failure on the part of this Court to take such a stand will detract seriously from the efficient administration of criminal justice according to law. That efficient administration of criminal justice requires imperatively -- although, no doubt, amongst other things -- the affording by the legal profession of proper assistance to trial judges. A fundamentally important aspect of that professional duty of assistance is the duty to take at the proper time and in the proper way proper objections to the trial judge's summing-up in a particular case."" 
        
       
      
    112 Here, there was no affidavit from counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial. Had an application been made to exclude the Alibi Notice in the case against Toai Siulai, it is likely to have provoked a re-examination of the basis upon which the notice was to be admitted (not only against the appellant, but also perhaps against Solomon Siulai). The appellant, and perhaps Solomon Siulai, were at risk of the notice being admitted as evidence capable of exhibiting a consciousness of guilt. Were that to occur, her Honour would have been obliged to give a full ""Edwards direction"", as she recognised (supra para 67). Necessarily that would have given prominence to the Alibi Notice and the issue of whether the appellant had told a deliberate lie through a consciousness of guilt. More than that, were the notice admitted upon that basis, it was capable of being regarded as evidence independent of Mr Stephens which supported an inference of guilt. Here her Honour gave what may be termed a ""Murray direction"" (R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12) emphasising that the Crown case depended upon an acceptance of the evidence of Mr Stephens (S/U 8). Had there been evidence independent of Mr Stephens, the summing up would have been somewhat different. Whilst obviously Mr Stephens would still have been the backbone of the Crown case, the impact of the ""Murray direction"", if given, may have been diluted by reference to the evidence which did not depend upon Mr Stephens. 
     
      
    113 There were sound tactical reasons, therefore, why counsel for the appellant should have refrained from making such an application. It is plain from the numerous exchanges which have been set out above that counsel was well aware of these issues. I would therefore infer that no application was made for tactical reasons. 
     
      
    114 Moving to the second error, made in the course of the summing up, again no redirection was sought. The error was more subtle. It depended upon an appreciation of the differences between the direction given in the context of Solomon Siulai (supra paras 87, 88) and that in respect of the Alibi Notice itself (supra paras 89, 90). It is not possible to say that counsel refrained from objecting for tactical reasons. Nonetheless, no redirection was sought. 
     
      
    115 Did either or both errors result in the possibility of a miscarriage of justice? Here the Crown case substantially depended upon an acceptance of Mr Stephens (and a rejection of the possibility that Solomon Siulai may have provided a truthful and accurate account). There were aspects of Mr Stephens' evidence where you would have expected corroboration, and yet none was provided. Mr Stephens said, for instance, that he threw his keys over his neighbour's fence to prevent his assailants re-entering the house and endangering his daughters. After his return to the house, once his assailants had gone, he said he searched for his keys (it being dark). The search was made whilst the police were there.  
     
      
    116 The Crown called Snr Const Sullings, who was the officer who spoke to Mr Stephens shortly after the incident. In cross examination Snr Const Sullings said this: (T197) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And you did not or Mr Gallagher did not assist him to look for something such as a set of keys in the garden next door? 
         
        A. Not that I recall."" 
        
       
      
    117 There were a number of police present. However, none was called to support this aspect of Mr Stephens' account which suggested that he was in fear.  
     
      
    118 Mr Stephens also said that, after his assailants fled, he escaped through the laundry window, breaking a number of louvres. The owner of the premises was called. He did not corroborate that assertion, although it was acknowledged that ultimately the window had been replaced. 
     
      
    119 Nevertheless, the account of Mr Stephens was handsomely supported by the 000 call to the police. He whispered his urgent message over the phone, providing an account consistent with the evidence he gave before the jury. The evidence of Solomon Siulai also corroborated aspects of Mr Stephens' account. He said that he was one of three men who had gone to the front door of Mr Stephens' home very late on 4 August 2001. He went with his brother, Toai, and another man, who was caucasian. They went downstairs where they encountered Mr Earl Young. Mr Young produced a screwdriver after the appellant placed his foot in the door. The group then moved to the laundry. 
     
      
    120 It may be noted that there was evidence in the Crown case which contradicted aspects of Mr Stephens' account. The front door had a deadlock. He said that as he left the house he closed the door to safeguard his daughters. One daughter and the police, however, said the front door was open. Moreover, Mr Stephens' first account to the police suggested an assault with a screwdriver when he was forced against a motor vehicle, which he later denied.  
     
      
    121 On the other hand, the account given by Solomon Siulai was inherently absurd. It involved three men going to Mr Stephens' home at 11.40 pm to discuss a matter of community concern. Mr Stephens made the suggestion that they move downstairs, no doubt because the issue was one of some delicacy and there was a need for privacy. Having moved downstairs, through areas large enough to hold a public meeting, Mr Stephens, according to Solomon Siulai, asked his neighbour of three weeks, Mr Young, whether they might enter his flat, presumably so they could continue their discussion. And once that was refused, and a screwdriver produced, Mr Stephens, it was said, selected a small laundry as their meeting place, again by-passing more spacious alternatives. 
     
      
    122 What prejudice is it suggested the appellant suffered by reason of the errors? The prejudice was that the jury may resort to consciousness of guilt reasoning if they found that the account in the Alibi Notice was a deliberate lie. The jury did not have the benefit of the warning, which was part of the ""Edwards direction"" (supra para 94) that there may be many reasons for telling a lie, apart from a realisation of guilt. Lies may be told out of panic, or to escape an unjust accusation, or to protect some other person, or for some other reason. No doubt such a direction is especially important where a person is confronted at the scene, or soon after the event, where allegations are put, and a spontaneous response provided. That, of course, was not this case. Here, the notice was given four months after the incident. It was given whilst the appellant and his brother were in custody, having been arrested on this offence some time earlier. It was given after consultation with their counsel. There was no question of panic. The real issue was whether, by reason of the description given to the offence (home invasion) and the passage of time, they may have been mistaken about the particular occasion and where they were. That was an issue which, in the summing up of her Honour, was well and truly before the jury. It was not an issue in respect of which the Edwards warning was especially relevant. 
     
      
    123 I am not persuaded that there was the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. I would apply Rule 4 and refuse leave to raise the issues which the appellant now seeks to canvass. 
     
      
    124 I would therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    125 BELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Kirby J generally for the reasons his Honour gives, subject to the qualifications expressed by Sperling J, with respect to ground one. In relation to ground one I agree with the reasons of Sperling J.

    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon the applicant by her Honour Judge Backhouse on 21 March 2003 for a number of offences in breach of the criminal law of the Commonwealth. 
     
      
    4 On 25 July 2002 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court under the now repealed s 52A of the Justices Act to thirty-two offences as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) 12 offences contrary to s 29D of the  
        Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
        , being counts 1 to 9, 25 and 26 on the committal document; 
         
         
        (b) 18 offences contrary to s 134.2(1) of the  
        Criminal Code (Cth) 
        , being counts 10 to 24 and 30 to 32 
         
         
        (c) 3 offences contrary to s 135.1 of the  
        Criminal Code (Cth) 
         being counts 27 to 29. 
        
       
      
    5 The offences falling within the first category above were offences of defrauding the Commonwealth under a now repealed provision of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty prescribed for an offence against that section was imprisonment for 10 years and a pecuniary penalty of $66,000. The offences in the second category were offences of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity and carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years and a pecuniary penalty of $66,000. The offences in the third category were offences of lodging a false document with intent to obtain dishonestly a gain from a Commonwealth entity, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and a pecuniary penalty of $33,000. 
     
      
    6 The offences fall into these three categories by reason of the fact that, during the course of criminal conduct engaged in by the applicant, the relevant offence-creating provision of the Crimes Act was repealed and replaced with provisions of the Criminal Code. Thus some of the particular frauds perpetrated by the applicant resulted in a charge laid under the Crimes Act provision and others under the provisions of the Code. In some instances a particular fraud resulted in two charges being laid because the criminal conduct bridged the repeal of one statute and the commencement of the other. It was conceded by the Crown that there were nine extra offences arising only as a result of the change in the legislative basis for the charges laid against the applicant. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was ultimately sentenced by her Honour, and not without some confusion as to the appropriate counts included in each sentencing order, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) Counts 1 to 8: imprisonment for five years to commence on 15 May 2002 and to expire on 14/2/07. 
         
         
        (ii) Counts 9 to 11, 14 to 19, 26 and 30: imprisonment for five years to commence on 15 May 2002 and expire on 14 May 2007. 
         
         
        (iii) Counts 12 to 13, 20 to 24, 31 to 32: imprisonment for two years cumulative to the sentences imposed in respect of the sentences for the offences referred to in (i) and (ii). 
         
         
        (v) Counts 27 to 29: imprisonment for one year cumulative to the sentences imposed in respect of the offences referred to in (iii). 
        
       
      
    8 It appears, however, that her Honour intended to structure the sentences to achieve the following result: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) Sentence of imprisonment for five years for each of the nine s 29D offences; 
         
         
        (ii) Concurrent sentence of imprisonment for five years for each of the equivalent nine s 134.2 offences; 
         
         
        (iii) Cumulative sentence on (ii) of imprisonment for two years for each of the 134.2 offences committed while on parole; 
         
         
        (iii) Cumulative sentence on (iii) of imprisonment for one year for each of the 135.1 offences committed while on parole. 
        
       
       
      Her Honour unfortunately did not achieve that result and failed to sentence the applicant for count 25 on the committal document, a matter to which I shall return later. 
       
      
    9 As a result of these sentences her Honour imposed an effective head sentence of eight years to date from 15 May 2002 with a single non-parole period of five years to commence from that date and to expire on 14 May 2007. The specification of a single over-all non-parole period is in accordance with s 19 AB of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    10 The offences arose from a course of fraudulent activity engaged in by the applicant during a period from November 1997 until he was arrested for the subject offences on 15 May 2002. Over that period the applicant obtained financial benefits from the Commonwealth by the use of 23 false identities and at the time of his arrest was in receipt of 18 benefits in false names. As a result of this fraudulent conduct the applicant obtained from the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency the sum of $362,997.24 to which he was not entitled. In respect of three of the offences charged the applicant was unsuccessful in his attempts to obtain a benefit by the use of false names and these were the offences contained in counts 27 to 29 on the committal document. 
     
      
    11 It is unnecessary to detail the facts and circumstances surrounding each of the offences committed by the applicant. It is sufficient to note that they involved a scheme of some complexity in which false identities were created for the sole purpose of obtaining benefits from the Commonwealth and designed to make investigation and detection of the frauds extremely difficult. The applicant used identities gleaned from obituary notices of Australian citizens deceased overseas and manufactured documents supporting the claims and the continued payments of the benefits obtained as a result. On occasions he recruited other persons to assist him in perpetrating the frauds by producing on his behalf the false documents previously manufactured by him. 
     
      
    12 The offences came to light only when comparison was made across the data-base held by the agency and it became apparent that there were similarities in the details of some claimants. Closer inspection of these claims revealed a similarity in the handwriting on the claim forms. The claims were supported by fraudulent statutory declarations and other documentation, such as forged bail continuation forms. The search of the applicant’s premises revealed a considerable amount of documentation used in support of the false claims. However, when he was arrested and interviewed, the applicant denied some of the offences and refused to answer questions in relation to others. There is little doubt that, had the offences not been brought to light through investigations by the relevant agency, the frauds would have continued unabated. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was receiving more than $7,000 per fortnight in fraudulently obtained benefits at the time of his arrest. No assets of any significance were realised with the funds received and there is no prospect of the payments being recovered. The applicant was arrested living in rented premises in Woollahra with a female whom had been supporting to the extent of $1,000 a week. There were at least two females whom the applicant had been “rehabilitating” by the use of the funds he obtained from these frauds. He provided them with comfortable accommodation in two of Sydney’s more prestigious suburbs, paid their expenses and bestowed on them gifts of cash and expensive presents. This is the only explanation forthcoming from the applicant as to what happened to the funds obtained by him. 
     
      
    14 Subject to the issue of the applicant’s mental state at the time of the offending, this was a plain case of the applicant setting out to defraud the Commonwealth Government of a large amount of money for his own use over a lengthy period of time through a well-planned and carefully executed course of fraudulent criminal activity. There was a significant degree of organisational and management skills exhibited by the applicant in conducting these frauds under so many identities and with a number of different bank accounts and postal addresses. The applicant is a highly intelligent person who put to good use in perpetrating these frauds his academic qualifications; a degree of Bachelor of Economics and a Diploma in Business Studies from the University of New England. 
     
      
    15 The applicant’s criminal record is significant. In 1993 he was convicted of an offence involving a breach of the Passports Act by making a false document and was sentenced to 150 hours community service. In August 1994 he was sentenced for offences concerned with aiding in the obtaining of a false passport, the opening and operation of false bank accounts and breaching the community service order. He was sentenced to imprisonment for three months. 
     
      
    16 On 21 April 1997 the applicant was before the District Court on appeal from a magistrate on four counts of making false statements. He was convicted but sentence was deferred on the applicant entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for two years. That bond was current when the applicant committed the first of the offences now before the Court. 
     
      
    17 On 13 March 2000 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court for an offence of malicious wounding and the detention of a police officer, who had attempted to arrest him for a series of fraud matters. He appealed against the sentence imposed in respect of those offences but in the meantime was sentenced on 14 June 2000 for a series of fraud and forgery offences against both State and Commonwealth law to a period of imprisonment. This Court dismissed an appeal against those convictions on 30 March 2001. See R v Knight [2001] NSWCCA 114. 
     
      
    18 On 5 September 2001 this Court determined an appeal against the sentences imposed in March 2000 and redetermined one of the sentences. See R v Knight [2001] NSWCCA 344. As a consequence of these offences the applicant was required to serve a term of imprisonment of four years from 21 September 1999 with a non-parole period of 18 months that expired on 20 March 2001, the date upon which the applicant was released to parole. 
     
      
    19 During his period in custody, payments were made as a result of his earlier fraudulent claims, although he did not personally receive them. Other benefits lapsed because the applicant was unable to comply with the conditions for their continued payment. However, on release from custody the applicant immediately applied himself with vigour to take up his fraudulent activity from where he had been forced, by incarceration, to leave off. He re-applied for the lapsed payments and invented twelve new identities in order to obtain previously unclaimed benefits. 
     
      
    20 In submissions before Judge Backhouse the Crown divided the offences into three classes as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Class 1: Offences which began before the prisoner’s gaol term commenced, continuing whilst he was there and ceased only when he was arrested by the Australian Federal Police on 15 May 2002. These are the matters of Barg, Daw, Hughes and Warburton each of which was a false name. 
         
         
        Class 2. In each of these the claim was made before the prisoner was gaoled, lapsed during that period and resumed after his release; Montgomerie, Selmes, Shanks, Richard Smith and Roger Smith  
         
         
        Class 3. These offences began after the prisoner’s release in 2001; Collette, Ewald, Ewins, Glayde, Harding, Harris, Kirk, Milton, Oates, Quinn, Sampson, Helen Smith. 
        
       
       
      It should be obvious that the offences in the second and third categories were either instituted or re-commenced while the applicant was on parole for earlier fraud offences. 
       
      
    21 The prosecutor submitted to her Honour that the matters before the court were in the very worst category of offences of their nature. That was in my view an appropriate categorization of the criminal conduct disclosed by the offences. Her Honour did not find it to be in the worst category because of the applicant’s mental condition, to which I shall refer later, but in my opinion the applicant was fortunate in that assessment. True it is that the amount obtained, although considerable, may not have been a record for offences of this kind and not all of it was received by him personally. But the commencement of this course of criminal activity while he was subject to a good behaviour bond and then persisting in it, despite the fact that he had been sentenced to imprisonment for fraud and released to parole, are seriously aggravating features that in combination with the nature and the extent of the applicant’s fraudulent conduct made it a most serious example of conduct falling within the relevant provisions. The applicant’s personal circumstances do little in my view to mitigate the offences. 
     
      
    22 It should be borne in mind that the maximum penalty with which her Honour was concerned and by which her discretion was limited was not the maximum for any one offence. Had her Honour come to the view, which in my view would have been open to her, that the criminal conduct engaged in by the applicant warranted a sentence of more than ten years imprisonment, there was no legal principle that would have prevented her from imposing a total sentence that, by way of cumulation, would have exceeded the maximum for any one offence. Nor would her Honour have had to come to a finding that the conduct fell within the worst category for offences of its kind before it was open for her to impose a sentence equivalent to the maximum for any one offence. 
     
      
    23 The first three grounds of appeal concern her Honour’s decision to accumulate the sentences for some of the offences. It is argued that, because the applicant was involved in a single course of criminal conduct, her Honour had no reason, or gave no reasons, for not making all the sentences concurrent. It was submitted that her Honour may have been unduly influenced by the number of offences and overlooked that they were inflated by two facts, that there was a change in the relevant legislation and that the Crown abandoned its normal practice of charging a number of acts of fraud in a single count when they formed part of a single course of criminal conduct. It is further argued that the application of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 worked unfairly against the applicant because of the number of offences that he faced. 
     
      
    24 As I have already noted there were nine additional offences charged as a result of the change in the legislation, so that, in respect of each of nine of the twenty-three identities used by the applicant, two charges arose rather than one. In my view this fact is of lesser significance than it might have been given the number of identities adopted by the applicant and the extent of his fraudulent conduct in providing support for those identities when making the claims and in obtaining the benefits. However, her Honour was well aware of this anomaly, it having been brought to her attention by the prosecutor at the commencement of the hearing. She referred to it in her sentencing remarks and intended to make the offences arising from that circumstance concurrent with the counterpart offences under s 29D. Although her Honour did not achieve that result, this error did not have the effect of unduly inflating the overall sentence. 
     
      
    25 The Crown appearing before this Court has disputed that any practice existed whereby the prosecution relied upon a single charge to encompass separate acts of fraud performed as part of a single enterprise in obtaining benefits from the Commonwealth. It is unnecessary to determine whether such a practice did exist for at least three reasons: firstly, it is a matter for the prosecution to determine what charges are laid against an accused person as a result of his or her criminal activity; secondly, if such a general, indiscriminate practice did exist it is not one that, in my view, this Court should endorse; and thirdly, the relevant issue at the end of the day, so far as sentencing is concerned, is not the number of offences before the court but the criminality revealed by them.  
     
      
    26 The Crown has an almost unfettered discretion in determining what charges are to be brought against an offender provided that the nature or number of the charges does not result in oppression or unfairness to the accused; R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25 at [42]. The time for any genuine complaint to be made as to the conduct of the prosecutor in this regard is at the time of, or shortly after, the charging of the offences rather than at the time of sentence or on appeal. The court is able to curb any excesses on the part of the prosecution, in the rare case where it is necessary to do so, by staying the prosecution of a charge or charges as being oppressive. In the more usual case, the sentencing court will be astute to make a proper assessment of the criminality actually arising from the offender’s conduct and to ensure that the sentence imposed does not exceed what is appropriate to reflect the criminality of that conduct, regardless of the number of charges for which sentence is to be imposed. 
     
      
    27 However, I doubt that it would be appropriate for a prosecutor, in a case where there are a significant number of distinct and serious fraudulent acts over a lengthy period of time but against a single victim, to reflect that course of criminality in a single rolled up charge. Such a procedure has the tendency to mask the real extent of the criminal conduct perpetrated by the offender and can result in a sentence that fails to adequately reflect that criminality. It can also lead to issues about duplicity and fairness to the accused where he or she might have a defence available to some of the allegations but not to others. In the present case the prosecutor indicated to Judge Backhouse, in explanation for the number of charges, that the Crown had taken the course it did in fairness to the accused in case he had a defence to some particular charge or charges. 
     
      
    28 The prosecutor also stressed to her Honour that the Crown was relying upon the totality of the criminality involved rather than the number of charges and cautioned the sentencing judge against being “dazzled” by their number. There is in my view no reason to suspect that the sentencing discretion exercised by Judge Backhouse may have miscarried merely by reason of the number of the charges faced by the applicant and to which he had pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    29 Counsel for the applicant argued forcefully both in written submissions and orally that her Honour had erred in imposing cumulative sentences because this was a single course of criminal conduct aimed at defrauding the Commonwealth. I would reject the submission as in my view it would be inappropriate to class the present case as being one of a single course of conduct warranting concurrent sentences simply because the applicant had resolved on a particular course of criminal activity through which to obtain whatever money he required for whatever purpose. Not only did the applicant use a number of different identities, he also claimed different types of benefits, he used persons to assist him in claiming some of those benefits, and he made a number of false claims at different times during the course of his criminal enterprise. Perhaps more significantly the applicant instituted or resurrected fraudulent claims after he had been released to parole from serving a sentence for fraud offences. To regard those matters as being merely a continuation of the same course of criminal conduct engaged in before he was sent to prison, is in my view, incompatible both with a proper appreciation of the facts and established sentencing principles. 
     
      
    30 In any event, the fact that the offences arose from a single course of criminal conduct would not have required her Honour to impose concurrent sentences for those offences. See Wilkins (1988) 38 A Crim R 445. It is erroneous for a court to impose concurrent sentences on the basis that the offences arose from a single course of criminal conduct where the overall sentence imposed does not reflect the total criminality involved in that course of conduct: Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516. 
     
      
    31 The contention that in some way the applicant was disadvantaged because of the application of Pearce is in my opinion completely misconceived. The fundamental principle in sentencing for multiple offences is that the overall sentence imposed must reflect the totality of the criminality evidenced by those offences: the totality principle. Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15 makes it clear that this principle was neither established nor affected by the decision in Pearce. The significance of Pearce, in this regard, was to indicate the preferred manner in which sentences are to be structured in order to achieve compliance with the totality principle. In particular this Court has interpreted Pearce as prohibiting the practice of increasing a sentence for one offence merely to reflect the totality of the criminality disclosed by all of the offences for which sentence is being passed. Johnson merely confirms that compliance with the totality principle can also be achieved by decreasing a sentence that is to be made wholly cumulative with a sentence for another offence. 
     
      
    32 In the present case her Honour sought to apply the principle in Pearce, but, with respect, not altogether successfully. However, her Honour did recognise that the totality of the criminality reflected by the offences before her required that there be some accumulation of the sentences to be imposed because the appropriate sentence for any one of the offences would not have been sufficient to reflect the totality of the criminality involved in all the offences. Further, her Honour sought to overcome the double punishment aspect arising from the change in legislation by making the sentences for the s 29D offences and the counterpart s 134.2 offences concurrent. 
     
      
    33 The applicant was aged 59 years at the date of sentencing and has some health problems. These matters can have little significance in determining the appropriate sentence having regard to the objective facts and, in particular, that the applicant committed further offences by inventing eleven identities after his release to parole in 2001. It is trite that advanced age and ill health cannot, generally speaking, provide an excuse for the commission of criminal activity. Nor do they themselves necessarily warrant leniency. In a case such as this where the applicant has a record for serious fraudulent conduct over a lengthy period of time and these present offences continued unabated until his arrest, these subjective considerations can be given little, if any, weight. 
     
      
    34 This is a case where the applicant’s criminal antecedents give rise to considerations that were enunciated by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No2) 164 CLR 465 at 477, and the applicant has “manifested in his commission of the instant offence[s] a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law”. The sentences to be imposed had not only to act as general deterrence but also had to reflect an element of specific deterrence. 
     
      
    35 The next ground of appeal contends that her Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the applicant’s mental state at the time of the commission of the offences. There were two reports before her Honour relevant to his mental state; the first a report by Dr Clark of February 2000, the second a report of Dr Carne dated 20 January 2003. Dr Clark opined that the applicant was suffering from a Bipolar Disorder and his feelings of “over-valued ideas of his own worth and capabilities are grandiose”. 
     
      
    36 Dr Carne, however, did not believe that the applicant was suffering from a mental illness but that he had a Personality Disorder “by virtue of his tendency to self-isolation, his feelings of being an outcast from childhood and his predisposition to help others without regards to the consequence for himself”. He thought that there may be some form of treatment available to assist the applicant but stated “it would be difficult to offer a prognosis without first assessing the response to an initial period of treatment”. Dr Carne found that the applicant’s criminal conduct was related to his personality disorder particularly manifesting in “his fraudulent use of disability allowances, not primarily for himself, but to support his friends”. 
     
      
    37 Judge Backhouse took into account the applicant’s mental state as a mitigating factor in assessing his criminal responsibility. She also was conscious of that line of authority that holds that general deterrence may be given less weight in a case where the offender suffers from a significant mental disability. In my view the sentence imposed does not indicate that her Honour mistook or otherwise failed to appreciate the significant of the applicant’s mental state, such as it was. The repetitious nature of his offending over a very lengthy period indicates that he is an entrenched fraudster and he is not an inappropriate subject for a sentence involving the full measure of general deterrence that such criminal conduct warrants. 
     
      
    38 The final matter of complaint was that her Honour failed sufficiently to take into account that the applicant will serve his sentence on protection. There was in evidence before Judge Backhouse a letter from the NSW Police Service which explained that the applicant had, during the course of his imprisonment before his release in March 2001 given information to police investigating a gaol murder. That information was not considered to be crucial to the Crown case and the applicant was not called at the trial of the alleged offender. 
     
      
    39 The current position is that the applicant is housed at the Junee Correction Centre in the Special Management Area Placement (SMAP), which offers protection without segregation from other prisoners with similar concerns. There are presently 450 inmates being held in the SMAP. The applicant has full access to employment, TAFE programmes, and recreational opportunities. There is no evidence that his imprisonment will, physically at least, prove more onerous to him by reason of his protected status. Although it was submitted that he would find prison more mentally stressful because of his protected status, there is no evidence to that effect and I would not be prepared to infer it in the applicant’s case at least. The applicant must have known that further criminal activity after his release to parole would inevitably return him to custody, and to protection. In all of these circumstances there would have been no requirement, and no justification, for her Honour to have given any mitigation by reason of his protected status. 
     
      
    40 Although the sentence imposed was a substantial one, especially having regard to other cases to which we were referred, and at the top of the existing range, it was in my view a sentence well justified by the objective facts. 
     
      
    41 Insofar as the unsentenced count 25 is concerned the Crown has submitted that this Court should remit the matter to the District Court. I agree as I do not believe this Court has any jurisdiction to pass a sentence where the sentencing court has failed to do so. This is unsatisfactory because the Crown concedes that any sentence imposed for that count would not affect the term of the sentence to be served by the applicant. However, it seems to me to be inappropriate that the applicant should have been convicted of an offence but remain unsentenced for it. 
     
      
    42 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. The matter is to be remitted to the District Count only for the purpose of that Court sentencing the applicant in respect of count 25 on the committal document.

    3 HIDDEN J: After a trial at the Parramatta District Court before Payne DCJ and a jury, the respondent, Barry John Niass, was found guilty of a charge of break enter and steal: an offence under s112(1) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. When he appeared for sentence he asked her Honour to take into account an offence of possessing a prohibited drug, arising from the fact that the police who arrested him in respect of the major offence found a small quantity of amphetamine in his possession. Taking that matter into account, her Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of fifteen months, but suspended that sentence under s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act upon his entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for the period of the sentence. Pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, the Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against that sentence. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 In the early hours of 24 December 2001, the respondent and two other men broke into a factory at Guildford through a side door, having removed a padlock from a perimeter fence. They then broke through an inner wall and opened a roller-door. They “hot wired” a Bobcat loader, valued at about $45,000, drove it through the roller-door and onto a truck, using heavy metal ramps. However, the further pursuit of the offence was frustrated by the arrival of the police, who had been contacted by a member of the community who saw the truck. By the time they arrived, the Bobcat was on the back of the truck and the truck’s motor was running. The respondent was arrested but his co-offenders got away. 
     
      
    5 Her Honour found that it was the respondent who provided the truck and the metal ramps, and that it was his function to take the Bobcat away from the premises. The truck was not registered in the respondent’s name, and police found in it a spanner, pinchbar and screwdriver which did not belong to its owner. Her Honour found that the offence was planned, and described the respondent’s role in it as “vital and integral”. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    6 The respondent was thirty-six years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty-eight. He has a criminal record which, while it does him no credit, is somewhat unusual. There are entries in Children’s Courts and Local Courts between 1981 and 1991 for offences of violence and of dishonesty, drug offences and driving offences. However, between 1991 and 1999, when he was living in Queensland, his record is clear except, apparently, for some driving offences. Between 1999 and 2002 there are further entries in New South Wales Local Courts for offences of violence and dishonesty and driving offences, and in July 2003 he was placed on a bond for goods in custody. 
     
      
    7 There is one entry for break enter and steal, but that was dealt with in a Children’s Court in 1981. Apart from committals to juvenile institutions in that same year, his only custodial sentence was a term of twenty months imprisonment imposed at a Local Court in August 2000 for a number of counts of obtaining money by deception. However, in 2001 he was ordered to perform concurrent terms of community service in respect of offences of violence and a drug offence, and he was subject to those orders at the time he committed the offence the subject of this appeal. Moreover, it was while he was on bail in respect of the present offence that he committed the offence of goods in custody which was dealt with in July 2003, to which I have referred. 
     
      
    8 Before her Honour was a pre-sentence report, from which it appears that the respondent had a disturbed background. He is one of five children, whose father died in a car accident in 1975 and whose mother died from cancer in 1994. There were difficulties in his relationships with his siblings. He left school after completing Year 8 and worked in various unskilled labouring positions in different parts of the country. However, about six years prior to the present sentence, he himself was involved in a car accident. As a result of his injuries, he was unable to work to the extent that he had previously and has been on a disability pension. 
     
      
    9 He has had three relationships with women, the first two of which produced a daughter and a son. The daughter is an adult but the son is a dependent child, who lives with his mother and for whom the respondent has provided some child support. The third relationship had existed for about a year at the time of sentence, but his partner had relapsed into drug abuse after a period of abstinence. 
     
      
    10 The author of the report noted that the respondent was attending an anger management program, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Niass has complied with the requests of this Service for the most part during the preparation of this Pre-Sentence Report. He failed to attend the first scheduled appointment, claiming that he had “forgotten about it”. However, he responded on the next occasion and appeared to be genuine about his claim. The offender has a poor reporting history with this Service. Possibly, these issues are related to many issues that extend back to his childhood years and hopefully his current anger management program will have some impact. 
        
       
       
        
        His upbringing would be considered to be difficult at best, albeit the efforts made after 1975 by his single parent mother caring for five children. The impact on the family after his father’s death when he was ten years old would have weighed heavily. His drug use and behavioural problems commenced a few years later followed by his criminal activities that all appear to have had a domino effect after losing his father. Coincidentally, he then has a car accident himself at age thirty-one. His relationships are also indicators of his instability and more so recently after his defacto recommenced her drug use. 
        
       
       
        
        If the Court should place the offender on a Bond, the offender has been assessed as requiring a [medium-High] level of intervention in the areas of: Anger Management and Psychological Intervention including Assessment and Treatment. Supervision would focus on the identified area and include participation in: An Anger Management program provided by this Service and a referral to a relevant psychologist for assessment and treatment. There are a range of anger and family related issues, along with perceived injustice issues, and possibly culminating in his accident, that may have had a significant impact on the offender’s offending behaviour over the last two decades. These issues, arguably, are a catalyst for his offences and require attention in an attempt to avoid further offence related behaviour. He has consented to undertake such a program of intervention to address his issues. 
        
       
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    11 Judge Payne considered the aggravating and mitigating factors set out in s21A(2)&(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In aggravation, she noted the respondent’s criminal record, the fact that the offence was committed while he was subject to community service orders, and that the offence was planned. In mitigation, she found that the loss or damage occasioned by the offence was not substantial and that the respondent had “reasonable” prospects of rehabilitation. She also had regard to the factors bearing upon sentence for the offence of break enter and steal examined in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327, as well as to the fact that the respondent was not entitled to the leniency he might have earned by a plea of guilty and the expression of remorse. 
     
      
    12 A matter which troubled her Honour was the delay in the case coming to trial and, later, to sentence. As I have said, the respondent was arrested on the day of the offence, 24 December 2001. He was committed for trial on 9 May 2002. However, the trial before her Honour did not begin until 31 July 2003. The jury returned their verdict on 8 August, but the sentence proceedings were not concluded until 19 December 2003. Sentence was passed on the same day. The reasons for the delay between committal and trial and between trial and sentence need not concern us. It is sufficient to say that none of it was the fault of the respondent. 
     
      
    13 For the two years between arrest and sentence the respondent was on bail, subject to a reporting condition. His only offence during that period was the goods in custody referred to earlier. Apart from the fact that it related to a small boat, there is nothing before us about the circumstances of that offence. Otherwise, her Honour saw some progress towards rehabilitation in his co-operation with the Probation and Parole Service and his having undertaken an anger management course.  
     
      
    14 Her Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        I do not think this is a crossroads case, but I am of the view that the Court confidently can say he has reasonable prospects for rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        I must say, I have found this a very difficult case. Indeed, I think it is certainly borderline. Probably the most significant feature the Crown has in its favour is that this was an organized activity. You have the taking of a truck to an industrial area in the early hours of the morning. You have equipment there to ensure there could have been a successful taking of this very expensive piece of equipment. Having said that and considering the matter very anxiously, I am of the view that ultimately, the community interest in this case will be served by the imposition of a custodial sentence, but then the suspending of that custodial sentence. In my view, in all of the circumstances, that will give sufficient weight to the requirement for denunciation and specific and general deterrence. I am also of the view the rehabilitation of the offender will be assisted by him knowing that if he does re-offend, then he will most certainly go into fulltime custody. 
        
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    15 The Crown prosecutor in this Court submitted, firstly, that it was not open to her Honour to find in mitigation of sentence that the loss or damage occasioned by the offence was not substantial. He relied upon the fact that an internal wall had been damaged and the Bobcat had been hotwired. However, he did not refer us to any evidence about the extent of that damage or the expense of repairing it. I am not persuaded that her Honour’s finding was not open to her. In any event, it is not a matter of such significance as to warrant this Court’s intervention. 
     
      
    16 More importantly, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. No argument was addressed to the length of the term of imprisonment, and I understand this submission to be directed to the fact that it was suspended. The Crown prosecutor referred to the undoubted seriousness of the offence, being a planned criminal enterprise involving property of substantial value committed by a man with a criminal record who was subject to community service orders at the time. He argued, in addition, that the sentence fails to reflect the drug offence which her Honour had to take into account. He challenged her Honour’s finding about the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation, relying upon the fact that he had committed a further offence of dishonesty while on bail awaiting his trial. Generally, he emphasised the need for a sentence to mark appropriately the seriousness of the offence: R v Hayes [2001] NSWCCA 358, per Sully J at [51]. 
     
      
    17 Of course, the Bobcat was recovered. Nevertheless, the offence was a serious one for the reasons identified by the Crown prosecutor, and it was attended by the aggravating circumstances to which he referred. All this her Honour recognised in her remarks. On the other hand, the drug offence which she took into account was a minor one.  
     
      
    18 However, in my view, it was open to her Honour to make the finding she did about the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation. There was a basis for that finding in the pre-sentence report and, while he did re-offend whilst on bail, it was open to her Honour to draw some comfort from the fact that that was his only offence during the two year period between arrest and sentence. Given his age, his background and his somewhat unusual antecedents, her Honour was justified in affording some weight to the element of rehabilitation in fashioning her sentencing order. 
     
      
    19 Allied to this is the delay in the proceedings being brought to finality, which was of itself a significant factor. In R v Blanco (1999) 106 ACrimR 303, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Bell J and Smart AJ agreed) referred to R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 and Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59, and continued at [16]: 
     
      
       
        
        The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach … 
        
       
      
    20 All that said, her Honour’s disposition in the present case is undoubtedly lenient. I am not persuaded, however, that it is manifestly inadequate. The salutary nature of a suspended sentence was recognised by Howie J (with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed) in his helpful review of the sentencing options under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [22] ff. By reference to R v JCE [2000] 120 ACrimR 18 and R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215, his Honour said at [31]: 
     
      
       
        
        A sentencing court, therefore, must recognise that a sentence of imprisonment can be a significant and effective punishment even where the execution of that sentence is suspended … That is why, in the hierarchy of sentencing alternatives, a suspended sentence is considered as more severe than a community service order even though it may appear on its face to be less punitive. 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour continued at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate. 
        
       
      
    22 The passage from her Honour’s remarks quoted above (at para 14 of this judgment) demonstrates that her Honour approached her sentencing task with these principles in mind. I would not interfere with the exercise of her Honour’s discretion, particularly in the light of the long recognised constraints upon this Court’s intervention on a Crown appeal. I should add that we have before us an affidavit of the respondent attesting to his continuing progress towards rehabilitation in the period of almost five months since sentence was passed. Even if the sentence were manifestly inadequate, I would still decline to intervene in the exercise of this Court’s residual discretion. However, I do not find resort to that discretion necessary.  
     
      
    23 I would dismiss the appeal.

    3 HOWIE J: On 12 December 2002 the Court as presently constituted allowed a Crown appeal against the sentences imposed upon the respondent by Judge Coorey and, as a consequence, sentenced the respondent to an effective head sentence of 4 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 10 months. See R v Finnie [2002] NSWCCA 533. The sentences included a period of 10 months pre-sentence custody and, therefore, the respondent is presently eligible to be considered for release to parole on 11 December 2004. The respondent appealed against the Court’s judgment to the High Court, but special leave was refused; Finnie v The Queen [2003] HCATrans 401. 
     
      
    4 There is now before the Court an application that the sentencing proceedings be re-opened pursuant to the power contained in s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That section is relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        43 Court may reopen proceedings to correct sentencing errors 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to criminal proceedings (including proceedings on appeal) in which a court has:  
         
          
          (a) imposed a penalty that is contrary to law, or 
           
          (b) failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law, 
           
           and so applies whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence in those proceedings. 
          
         
         
        (2) The court may reopen the proceedings (either on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings) and, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard:  
         
          
          (a) may impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law, and 
           
          (b) if necessary, may amend any relevant conviction or order. 
          
         
        
       
      The question raised by the application is whether the Court has jurisdiction to resentence the respondent. 
       
      
    5 It is unnecessary to refer to the issues arising from the earlier proceedings other than to note one of the successful grounds of appeal relied upon by the Crown. Judge Coorey took into account a period of 18 months pre-sentence custody dating from 23 March 2000 the date upon which the respondent had been refused bail on some of the charges for which he was being sentenced. These charges were referred to during the proceedings in this Court as “the Glass indictment”. However, from that date until 9 November 2000, the respondent was serving a term of full-time imprisonment by reason of the revocation of an order of periodic detention in relation to an earlier and unrelated sentence. The respondent remained in custody until released to bail by Judge Coorey on 6 September 2001. 
     
      
    6 This Court held that the sentencing judge was in error in backdating the sentence to a date when the respondent was serving a sentence for another unconnected offence and, as a consequence, determined that the respondent should receive the benefit of a period of 10 months pre-sentence custody rather than a period of 18 months as calculated by Judge Coorey. The present application is based upon an assertion that this Court was in error in its determination of the period of pre-sentence custody to which the respondent was entitled to have taken into account. 
     
      
    7 Judge Hosking imposed the sentence of imprisonment by way of periodic detention upon the respondent in June 1997. The relevant statutory basis of the order was the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981 (the 1981 Act). Under the provisions of that Act, it was not possible for a court to specify a non-parole period in respect of a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    8 The respondent commenced to serve the sentence but was granted bail when he appealed against the conviction from which the sentence arose. The appeal was dismissed and the Court ordered the respondent “to report to the Metropolitan Periodic Detention Centre on 29 October 1999 to commence serving the unexpired portion of his sentence”. See R v Finnie [1999] NSWCCA 329 at [26]. As there was no appeal against sentence, it is plain that this Court did not purport to re-sentence the respondent but rather to require him to continue serving the sentence imposed by Judge Hosking. 
     
      
    9 The respondent was subsequently breached for failing to attend for periodic detention and the Parole Board revoked the order on 25 January 2000. As a result, he was ordered by the Board to serve the balance of the sentence, a period of 41 weeks, by way of full-time custody. That sentence commenced on 28 January 2000 and was to expire on 9 November 2000. On 22 March 2000 the respondent pleaded guilty to offences on the “Glass indictment”. Because he was in custody serving the balance of the sentence imposed by Judge Hosking, bail was not sought and was refused. The respondent was, therefore, in custody from 23 March 2000 for two reasons: he was serving a sentence and bail was refused in respect of an offence for which this Court ultimately sentenced him. 
     
      
    10 The present application is based upon an assertion that this Court did not consider all the relevant facts relating to the breach of the periodic detention order and the consequential sentence served by the respondent. The argument set out in the written submissions on behalf of the respondent was that when the revocation came before the Parole Board the parties and the Board apparently acted on the erroneous belief that the sentence was imposed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, when in fact the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 operated. As a result the Board believed that it lacked any power to release the respondent to parole, as the sentencing judge had not specified a non-parole period. However, this was an erroneous approach because the transitional and saving provisions contained in Division 2 of Schedule 5 to the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act applied to a sentence imposed under the 1981 Act. 
     
      
    11 The relevant provision is contained in Clause 31 of the Schedule. It is unnecessary for present purposes to set out the text of the clause, but in effect it provides that, in respect of an order made under the 1981 Act and imposed before February 1999, a person, who becomes liable to serve full-time imprisonment as a consequence of a revocation of the order, is eligible to be released to parole on the date the clause came into effect. The Parole Board is required, within 30 days of the date of revocation of the order, to consider whether or not the prisoner should be released to parole. 
     
      
    12 The date upon which Clause 31 commenced was 3 April 2000, and, therefore, that was the notional date upon which the respondent became eligible for release to parole. Mr Byrne SC, who appeared for the respondent on this application, conceded that at the date of the revocation of the periodic detention order, 25 January 2000, the Parole Board had no power to set a non-parole period or consider the release of the respondent to parole because the Clause had not come into operation. However, he submitted that the clause applied to the respondent from the date of its commencement and, thereafter, the Parole Board could have considered an application for release to parole by the respondent had he made such an application. The Crown agrees with this submission. 
     
      
    13 In light of these provisions, the submission made on behalf of the respondent and contained in the application for a re-opening of the proceedings was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The effect of the above is that [the respondent] could well have been eligible for parole on or about 3 April 2000, when the non-parole period for the periodic detention sentence expired. Assuming that this was the case, then the only reason that [the respondent] was in custody was due to the ` 
        Glass Indictment 
        ’ and therefore it could be said that that period of custody was referrable to the matters upon which [the respondent] was sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
        
       
       
      It is asserted that this Court is shown to have been in error in backdating the sentence to November 2000 rather than to the date in April 2000, once the true situation in respect of the respondent’s sentence is revealed. That is the error that the present application seeks to have corrected under s 43. 
       
      
    14 It should be noted that s 43 is not concerned with the correction of all sentencing errors despite the apparent width of the section heading. The section only applies where one of two errors has occurred in the sentencing of the applicant; either the court has imposed a sentence that is contrary to the law or the court has failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law. There is a wide inclusive definition of the term “impose a penalty” contained in subsection 6, but it is unnecessary to consider it for present purposes. Assuming that it has jurisdiction to do so, this Court would have power to refix the commencement date of the sentences and to make any consequential orders. The question that arises is whether the Court has jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings. 
     
      
    15 This Court first considered the scope of one of the forerunners of the present section in R v Petrou (NSWCCA, 13 February 1990, unreported). The provision was then found in s 19 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Court was there concerned with the scope of the word “penalty”, but it recognised the beneficial nature of the provision and considered that the words of the section should be given the widest interpretation possible. The provision then under consideration does not differ in any material respect from the present section, but it should be noted that Parliament has varied the wording of the provision from that contained in s 19 while retaining the pre-conditions that must exist before the section can operate. 
     
      
    16 In Tolmie (1994) 72 A Crim R 416 this Court considered the nature of the sentencing errors to which the provision applied in light of similar provisions in other jurisdictions but was unable to form a concluded view as to that matter. However, in Ho v DPP (1995) 37 NSWLR 393 the Court of Appeal considered all of the relevant authorities and concluded that a broad approach should be taken to the provision, then found in s 24 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    17 Ho concerned the failure of a sentencing judge to take into account the period spent by the offender in custody for the offence for which he was later sentenced. The applicant sought prerogative relief but this was refused. Although it was unnecessary to do so for the purpose of determining the appeal, Kirby P, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, considered the scope of the provision in light of existing authorities. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Certain observations may be made about s24: 
         
         
        (1) The section appears in remedial legislation designed to permit, as Pt7 of the Act makes clear, “Correction of sentencing errors”. Given the remedial purposes of the section, it should not be subjected to a narrow construction. See R v Petrou Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), unreported, 13 February 1990; 
         
         
        (2) That a broad interpretation of the section was intended by Parliament is confirmed, not only by the general purpose of the section and the broad definition of terms provided in s24(7) of the Act. It is also confirmed by the Second Reading Speech of the Attorney General introducing the measure. See New South Wales Parliamentary Debates (Legislative Assembly) 21 September 1988, 1673. He stated that its object was to provide “a simple procedure to correct sentencing errors in criminal proceedings”. He went on to explain: The availability of this procedure will enable matters to be dealt with expeditiously. It will relieve appellate courts of unnecessary work and is a further step in the implementation of the Governments undertaking to reduce court delays ... It is an important and practical step and savings to the Government and the administration of justice will be substantial. These considerations are not irrelevant given the limitations upon the facility of appeal in criminal matters such as the present, and the limitations upon (and technical requirements of) judicial review as well as the public and private costs that are involved in correcting mistakes of a simple character by such procedures. Reinforced by the Minister’s explanation of the legislation to Parliament this Court should afford the language of the section the broadest available construction so as to achieve its stated objects; 
         
         
        (3) There are limits relevantly derived from the requirement that the penalty must be “contrary to law”. Such limitations have been revealed in earlier cases. See, eg, Boyd v Sandercock (1989) 46 A Crim R 206 (SCQ), where the Queensland Full Court analysed the equivalent provisions of s147A of the Justices Act 1886 (Qld). In the end, the Court must adhere to the requirements of Parliament as expressed in the statutory language. Ex Parte Beane; re Bolton and Anor (1987) 162 CLR 514, 518. It must do so even if this results in a conflict with the stated intentions of the Minister; 
         
         
        (4) It is to be noted that the phrase used in s24(1)(a) is not “imposed a penalty that is not provided by law”. A broader adjectival phrase is used to describe the “penalty” which authorizes the application of the section. It is enough that that penalty is “contrary to law”. It is a part of the law. 
        
       
       
      His Honour concluded that it was open to the claimant to make an application under the provision to the District Court. 
       
      
    18 The authorities on this type of provision in this and other jurisdictions were considered by the Court of Appeal of Western Australia in Traegar v Pires de Albuquerque (1997) 18 WAR 432. The Court was called upon to determine the scope of s 37 of the Sentencing Act (WA) which relevantly provided: 
     
      
       
        
         
        If a court sentences an offender in a manner that is not in accordance with this Act or the written law under which the offence is committed, the court may recall the order imposing the sentence and impose a sentence that is. 
        
       
      
    19 That was a case where the prosecutor had erroneously informed the court sentencing two defendants for motor traffic offences that neither had any prior convictions. The true position was that they both had prior traffic matters as a consequence of which they would have been liable to a greater penalty than if they had been first offenders. The magistrate refused to reopen the proceedings on the basis that the section did not apply as the sentence imposed was according to law on the facts as presented to the court. The Crown appealed. 
     
      
    20 The Court of Appeal held, following an earlier decision of the Court in Shortland v Heath [1977] WAR 61 but acknowledging that there was room for debate on the question, that the section applied in circumstances in which the sentence imposed was in accordance with the applicable law on the facts as presented to the court but where, if the true facts had been known, some other sentence would have been required. 
     
      
    21 In Melville v The Queen (1999) 150 FLR 296 the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Northern Territory was required to consider s 112 of the Sentencing Act (NT) the relevant provision of which was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) Where a court has in, or in connection with, criminal proceedings (including a proceeding on appeal 
         
         
        (a) imposed a sentence that is not in accordance with the law; 
         
         
         b) failed to impose a sentence that the court legally should have imposed 
         
         
        the court (whether or not differently constituted) may reopen the proceedings unless it considers the matter should more appropriately be dealt with by a proceeding on appeal. 
        
       
      
    22 That was a case concerned with the application of a sentencing principle that at the time of sentence had been held to be applicable but later determined by the High Court to be erroneous. The sentencing judge, when sentencing the offender, had taken into account, as an aggravating factor, that the trial proceedings had caused the complainant distress. The Court of Criminal Appeal had dismissed the offender’s appeal on the basis that the remarks disclosed no error. Shortly, thereafter, the High Court delivered its judgment in Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656. 
     
      
    23 In Siganto it was held that distress occasioned to a complainant by giving evidence in a criminal trial was not a matter that could be taken into account to aggravate the offence and increase the otherwise appropriate sentence. The offender then brought proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 112 to have the sentencing proceedings reopened to correct the error resulting from the incorrect application of sentencing principle identified by the High Court. 
     
      
    24 The Court of Criminal Appeal held that s 112 did not apply to the Supreme Court when constituted as the Court of Criminal Appeal and, therefore, it had no jurisdiction to reopen the sentencing proceedings determined by a single judge of the Supreme Court. However, the Court did comment on the scope of the section, and, by applying Ho v DPP and other decisions on similar provisions, concluded that the section operated only to correct errors of law, but that a wrong application of sentencing principle was an error of law for the purposes of the section. The section applied in the case before the court because, in the words of Kearney J at [29], “the sentence was not imposed in accordance with the law applicable to the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion”. 
     
      
    25 The Court of Criminal Appeal of the Northern Territory considered the scope of s 112 of the Sentencing Act (NT), a provision not materially different from s 43, in Staats v R (1999) 123 NTR 16. The sentencing judge had imposed a non-parole period upon the appellant on the basis, favourable to the offender, that a particular provision of the Sentencing Act (NT) concerned with the abolitions of remissions did not apply. The judge was aware, however, that this question was then being considered by the High Court in the appeal of Siganto, and averted to the possibility that he might be required to resentence the appellant if his interpretation of the provision was erroneous. After the High Court had delivered its decision revealing that the approach adopted by the sentencing judge was in error, the judge used the power in s 112 of that Act to reopen the proceedings and to fix, in accordance with the decision of the High Court, a longer non-parole period than that originally imposed. 
     
      
    26 Malcolm CJ stated that in his view: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “….s112 is limited in its application to errors of law in relation to the imposition of the sentence. It does not extend to the correction of reasons or review of the exercise of a discretionary judgment” 
        
       
       
      However, his Honour held that the section permitted the course adopted by the sentencing judge. Thomas J was also of the view that the sentencing judge was empowered to alter the sentence including the non-parole period in light of the fact that he had originally sentenced the appellant on an incorrect view of the applicable law. 
       
      
    27 Angel J also held that the sentencing judge did not err in re-opening the proceedings under the section. As to the scope of that provision, his Honour stated, at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        That section gives a sentencing judge the power to re-open proceedings where the court has “imposed a sentence that is not in accordance with the law'’ or has “failed to impose a sentence that it should legally have imposed'’. The section is somewhat akin to a slip rule. Its purpose appears to be to reduce the number of appeals against sentences. It should, in my opinion, be given a broad interpretation. The section does not employ the expression “error of law'’. The section does not empower the court to re-open a case merely because it has changed its mind as to the appropriate sentence. It is not necessary in the present case to decide the limit of a sentencing judge’s jurisdiction to re-open the case. It at least includes errors of law. It may well include judicial oversight of a fact obviously material for sentencing purposes, ie in a case where the court makes clear findings of fact, plainly applies the correct law to those facts, but overlooks a further fact, which, had it been taken into account, would obviously have affected the result. I would wish to hear argument on the issue before reaching any concluded view on the limits of the section. 
        
       
      
    28 In R v McMahon [2002] QCA 18, the Queensland Court of Appeal considered the scope of s 188 of the Penalties and Sentences Act (QLD) in a situation where the law had changed after the sentence was passed and, if the changed law had applied to the appellant, it would have resulted in a less severe sentence. The Court held that the section had no application to such a factual situation. It should be noted, however, that the operation of the provision was not in its terms restricted to errors of law in the imposition of the sentence but included circumstances where there had been “a clear factual error of substance in the sentence”. The Court held that there had been no factual error existing at the date of the sentence. 
     
      
    29 In Erceg v District Court of NSW [2003] NSWCA 379 the Court of Appeal considered the scope of the power under s 43 in a case where there was confusion as to the exact term of imprisonment imposed on the offender and, in particular, where there was a dispute as to the length of the non-parole period that had been fixed by the sentencing judge. The majority of the Court, McColl JA and Palmer J, were of the view that, although the section did not permit the court to re-open sentencing proceedings simply to clarify the sentence that had been imposed, the power was broad enough to cover a situation, where, through inconsistencies and discrepancies in the pronouncement of the sentence, a relevant error had occurred. The third member of the Court, Sheller JA, found it unnecessary to consider the scope of the section and whether it could be used to reopen the sentence proceedings. 
     
      
    30 This brief review of authorities on provisions similar to s 43 indicates that there may be at least one outstanding question to be resolved as to the scope of the provision: does the section apply to an error of law in the imposition of a sentence arising as a result of erroneous facts presented to the court or does it only apply to a sentence that was erroneous in law upon the facts presented to the court? It is, however, unnecessary to answer that question for the determination of the present application. 
     
      
    31 In my view there has not been disclosed any error of law made by this Court in the sentencing of the respondent which would attract the operation of s 43. It is not a case such as Ho v DPP where the Court failed to take into account a relevant sentencing fact or principle. Nor is it a case where this Court incorrectly applied a relevant sentencing principle or applied a principle later found to have been erroneous. This Court had a discretionary decision to make on the material before it as to when the sentences imposed by it were to commence. Provided that discretion was exercised in a principled way, and there has been no suggestion that it was not, no error of law could arise. 
     
      
    32 There is no doubt, in my mind, that the section can be engaged as a result of an erroneous finding of fact or an omission to find, or take into account, a relevant fact. As Angel J points out, the section does not use the expression “error of law”. Further, there is no requirement that any error be identified except in the outcome of the sentencing proceedings. It does not matter whether the sentencing court made a mistake of law or of fact in arriving at a penalty that was contrary to law or in failing to impose a penalty in accordance with the law. It is not difficult to imagine a situation where a sentencer misunderstood or overlooked a fact in evidence before the court and as a result imposed a sentence that fell within the scope of the provision. A not uncommon example would be where the failure to take into account the existence of a particular traffic conviction resulted in the court failing to impose the disqualification period mandated by statute where such a prior conviction exists. Where a relevant error is established, the section is engaged and, at least in so far as the jurisdiction of the court to reopen the sentencing proceedings is concerned, it is unnecessary for the court to determine how the erroneous sentence came about. 
     
      
    33 In any event, in my opinion there was no factual error disclosed in the Court’s reasoning for allowing the Crown appeal and imposing the sentences on the respondent that it did. Nor is there any error revealed after a consideration of the material upon which the respondent now seeks to rely. The respondent was within the period from April to November 2000 serving a sentence of imprisonment originally imposed by Judge Hosking and later implemented by the Parole Board. He was not in custody only by reason of an offence for which he was sentenced by Judge Coorey and later by this Court. The reasoning upon which the present application was founded requires this Court to act on the basis that the respondent was not serving a sentence by reason of the revocation of the order of periodic detention or should not be treated as if he were, even though as a matter of plain fact and law he indisputably was. 
     
      
    34 However that may be, the argument for the respondent is based upon two assumptions of fact that I would not be prepared to make. It is submitted that, firstly, had the respondent been aware of the true situation, it is likely that he would have made an application to the Parole Board after 3 April 2001 and, secondly, had he made such an application, it is likely that the Parole Board would have released the respondent to parole. As to the first assumed fact, there is no evidence before the Court from the respondent as to whether he would have made an application for release to parole had he known of his rights after 3 April, and I am not prepared to act on the basis of an inference that it was likely that he would have done so. He had made no application for bail on the Glass indictment, and there was an obvious tactical reason for him to forgo any release on the basis of serving some period in custody referable to the charges for which he was to be sentenced prior to sentencing. 
     
      
    35 As to the second assumed fact, this Court knows nothing about the material that might have been placed before the Parole Board if it had been called upon to determine whether to release the respondent or what considerations may have been relevant to that decision at that time. What is known is that the respondent failed to attend periodic detention because of a claimed illness, but that the Board rejected this excuse as not being bona fide. It is also known that the respondent was arrested for offences of dishonesty committed while he was on conditional liberty serving a sentence by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    36 Mr Byrne sought to rely, as support for the second assumed fact, upon what he contended was a legislative presumption that persons serving a sentence of less than three years be released to parole. This presumption was said to arise from s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That section in effect provides that when a court sentences an offender to a sentence of a term of three years or less, the court must specify the date upon which the offender is to be released to parole. In such a case the offender does not come before the Parole Board at the conclusion of the non-parole period. But that section by its terms only applies to a court when sentencing an offender and there are clearly different considerations to be applied by the Board when determining whether, and when, to release to parole an offender who has breached a periodic detention order. 
     
      
    37 In any event, in my view there is no point in the Court speculating upon what the Parole Board might have done had they considered whether to release the respondent to parole. Section 43 does not give this Court power to review a sentence simply because it is alleged that some injustice may have taken place at some stage, or at some time, in the period leading up to the imposition of the sentence. Although the Court might have taken into account the facts now placed before it when determining whether, and to what extent, to backdate the sentence imposed upon the respondent, the failure to do so, when those facts were not before the Court, does not itself engage the section. 
     
      
    38 The sentence imposed by this Court cannot, even on the broadest view of the words of s 43(1), be categorised as “a penalty that is contrary to the law”. Nor did the Court fail “to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law”. It does not matter for the purposes of determining this application whether the matter is approached on the basis of a consideration of the evidence that was before the Court when it sentenced the respondent or whether regard is had to the material now proffered in support of the application. The sentence imposed does not fall within the terms of the section on any factual basis either existing or assumed. 
     
      
    39 I am of the opinion that the Court has no jurisdiction to re-open the sentencing proceedings and I propose that the application be refused.

    2 ADAMS J: I agree with the judgment of Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Freeman in the District Court in respect of a large number of offences of dishonesty. The applicant had pleaded guilty before a magistrate under, the now repealed, s 51A of the Justices Act to 45 offences under three different provisions of the Crimes Act. She was committed to the District Court for sentence on those matters. She adhered to her pleas before Judge Freeman and asked him to take into account, when sentencing her in respect of one group of offences, 60 matters on a form 1 under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    4 The offences for which the applicant was sentenced were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) six charges of dishonestly obtaining money by deception contrary to s 178BA of the  
        Crimes Act. 
         This is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        (ii) ten offences of making a false statement to obtain a financial advantage contrary to s 178BB of the  
        Crimes Act. 
         This is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
         
        (iii) three charges of disposing stolen property contrary to s 188 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . This is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        (iv) 25 offences of making a false instrument contrary to s 300(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . This is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        (v) One further count of making a false instrument contrary to s 300(1) of the  
        Crimes Act. 
        
       
      
    5 The form 1 contained the following matters: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) three charges of make false statement with intent to obtain money contrary to s 178BA of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . 
         
         
        (b) 34 charges of using a false instrument contrary to s 300(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . 
         
         
        (c) three charges of goods in custody. 
         
         
        (d) eight charges of making a false instrument contrary to s 300(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . 
         
         
        (e) eleven charges of obtaining money by deception contrary to s 178BA of the  
        Crimes Act. 
         
         
        (f) 1 charge of having a false instrument contrary to s 302 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . 
        
       
      
    6 Judge Freeman sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months to date from 10 February 2003 and to expire on 9 August 2004. 
         
         
        (ii) Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months to date from 17 June 2003 and to expire on 16 December 2004. 
         
         
        (iii) Imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months to date from 10 February 2003 and to expire on 9 August 2003. 
         
         
        (iv) Imprisonment for 3 years to commence on 10 August 2003 with a non-parole period of 18 months to expire on 9 February 2005. 
         
         
        (v) Imprisonment for 3½ years to commence on 17 June 2003 with a non-parole period of 2 years to expire on 16 June 2005. 
        
       
       
      This is an effective sentence of 3 years 10 months and 6 days from 10 February 2003, with an overall non-parole period of 2 years 4 months and 6 days. The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 16 June 2005. 
       
      
    7 The offences were committed between 25 July and 30 December 2002. They arose from, what Judge Freeman described as a “prolonged, repeated and sophisticated, well planned series of frauds”. It is unnecessary for the purpose of the present application to detail the facts giving rise to the 105 charges laid against the applicant but they involved the fraudulent obtaining of money from a variety of victims including the Hospital Contribution Fund, banks, mobile phone companies, retailers and Medicare. The applicant by the use of a number of fraudulent identities obtained financial benefits of different types. 
     
      
    8 One series of offences involved the applicant obtaining a line of credit from a financial company by supporting her application for that credit with false pay sheets and false details of her address. By using that line of credit, the applicant obtained goods including a video camera and a stereo system. 
     
      
    9 Another series of offences related to frauds upon Medicare by the applicant presenting in the name of her mother false doctor’s invoices or by duplicating doctor’s receipt forms using a computer at one of two local government libraries. The applicant was able to perpetuate these frauds because she was able to harness her experience as a registered nurse to obtain the wherewithal to manipulate the Medicare system. 
     
      
    10 Another series of offences related to the disposal of mobile telephones that she had fraudulently obtained by the use of forged documents and which she either pawned or sold. 
     
      
    11 There were offences relating to her obtaining under false identification details a shopping card from a retail chain giving her a line of credit that she used to obtain Christmas presents. 
     
      
    12 There were a number of offences relating to fraudulent claims for payments allegedly made for medical and dental treatment. These receipts have been manufactured at one of the library computers and with the aid of a business stamp kit that she had purchased for the purpose. These claims were made in her own name, that of her daughter or her mother, whose membership of the Hospital Contributions Fund the applicant used. The cheques that she so obtained were cashed through her infant daughter’s bank account. 
     
      
    13 Another series of offences related to her obtaining a bank loan of $5,500 under a false identity supported by fraudulent documents. There was also a charge relating to the use of her key card linked to that loan. 
     
      
    14 There were a series of charges relating to another bank account that she had obtained fraudulently using a false identity and forged documents. She also obtained a key card in relation to this loan and fraudulently used it to obtain cash. 
     
      
    15 The charges on the form 1 relate to fraudulent activity of the same nature as that contained in the charges for which she was to be sentenced. 
     
      
    16 As a result of this fraudulent conduct over a period of almost 6 months the applicant received approximately $16,000. None of it is recoverable. The applicant gave evidence that she was at the time of the commission of the offences using amphetamine at a cost of $500 a day. She used the proceeds of her frauds to support her addiction, in gambling on poker machines and for living expenses including gifts for the children of her de-facto partner. The applicant told a probation officer that “she felt some thrill in achieving success in her criminal activity and this spurred her on to commit further crimes”. 
     
      
    17 The applicant was born on 8 June 1978. She has no relevant criminal record. She has a three-year-old child from an earlier relationship and the applicant’s mother is presently caring for the child. The applicant was receiving benefits as a sole parent before her arrest. She was at the time of the offences in a de-facto relationship with a man who was also addicted to amphetamine and to whom she intends to return when released. The applicant breached a condition of her bail that she not reside with this person and, as a result, bail was refused from 10 February 2003. 
     
      
    18 Dr Westmore prepared a report on the applicant for the purposes of the sentencing proceedings. The applicant told him that she had been using amphetamines for the last seven years on a recreational basis but her habit had increased to become a problem by the time she committed the offences. She told the psychiatrist that she did not believe she any longer had a drug problem after attending for treatment while in custody. However, she had sought to be enrolled in a community-based rehabilitation centre. Her de-facto partner was also now drug free. She believed that as a result of the offences she would be de-registered by the Nurses Registration Board for some period and hoped to attend university after her release. 
     
      
    19 The applicant claims to have been assaulted by another prison inmate and, as a result, was placed into protection. She said in evidence before the sentencing judge that she was subject to “lock down” for 18 hours a day, had no outside exercise and only limited resources in the way of counselling or welfare assistance. She had been accepted for the mother and child programme in the gaol but was ineligible while she was on protection. 
     
      
    20 The first ground of appeal was that his Honour failed to take into account that the offences could have been determined in the Local Court. Although the fact that the offences could have been dealt with by a magistrate is a matter that may be relevant, it is not always the case that a lost chance to be dealt with summarily will be a matter of mitigation: R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 per Grove J at [42]. 
     
      
    21 The applicant’s criminality was, in my opinion, too serious to be dealt with in the Local Court even though the magistrate may technically have had jurisdiction to deal with the offences; R v Royal [2003] NSWCCA 275 per Greg James J at [38]. It is not just the amount of money obtained by the criminal activity that determines whether the matters should be dealt with in the Local Court or what the appropriate sentence should be. The nature and extent of the offences perpetrated may indicate that summary jurisdiction, where the magistrate has a limited power to sentence effectively, is inappropriate. This was a case properly before the District Court and no mitigation of the sentence was warranted for that reason. 
     
      
    22 Ms Burgess, who appeared for the applicant, sought to rely upon the fact that the applicant’s partner was dealt with in the Local Court for offences of a similar nature to those for which the applicant was sentenced. But I do not see the relevance of that fact having regard to the very limited and less serious extent of his criminality when compared with that of the applicant. 
     
      
    23 The second ground of appeal contends that his Honour failed to give an adequate discount for the applicant’s plea and assistance to investigating police. His Honour found that the applicant had no contrition for her criminal activity and that she had a tendency to minimise her wrongdoing. His Honour said of the plea of guilty: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Her plea indicating a desire to facilitate the process of justice is, having regard to the sheer logistics of running a trial with so many charges, of significant utilitarian value. I have allowed a discount of 20 per cent. Her co-operation in the ERISP and in permitting a voluntary search of her premises, together with the way in which she volunteered information, such as the location of the computers used, has contributed to this level of discount. 
        
       
      
    24 It was submitted that the plea of guilty, coming at the earliest opportunity and before the magistrate, should have alone resulted in a discount of 25 per cent. This is an argument that converts a guideline into a rule. It has been said repeatedly by this Court that the discount for the plea is a discretionary matter and that a particular offender has no entitlement to any particular discount: R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286; R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 113. True it is that his Honour might have given a greater discount having regard to the assistance given by the applicant to police, but this is not a case where the applicant revealed to police unknown criminality such as would bring into play the principle in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. 
     
      
    25 Ms Burgess pointed out that 23 fresh charges were laid after the applicant had originally been charged with the majority of offences that were before the court. She submitted that this Court should infer that the additional charges were as a result of information given by the applicant to police that enabled them to prepare a case against her in respect of those matters. There was no direct evidence before the sentencing judge, notwithstanding that the applicant gave evidence, as to what material the police had as to these extra charges and whether they could or could not have presented a case without the applicant’s assistance. Certainly the applicant did help their investigation as to those matters in a significant way and his Honour acknowledged this was so in his remarks. 
     
      
    26 It was open for his Honour to come to the conclusion that, despite the assistance given and admissions made to investigating police in the ERISP, the applicant was not truly contrite for her criminal conduct, at least not to the degree where she should receive a significant discount in that regard. He heard her in the witness box and was entitled to form the view that he did. 
     
      
    27 Before leaving this ground I should remark that, notwithstanding what I have written above, I do not understand why his Honour was not prepared to give the applicant the benefit of a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of her pleas, particularly taking into account her admissions and ready assistance to police in what otherwise might have been a complex case. Even though Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 makes it clear that the assessment of the discount to be awarded for the utilitarian value of the plea is a matter of discretion, it is discretion that has to be exercised judicially. In the absence of any reasons for not giving a discount at the top of the range in the circumstances of the present case, I can only assume, with respect, that his Honour has either determined that no case should merit the full discount approved in the guideline judgment or has some misunderstanding of the considerations which are to be taken into account in determining the appropriate discount. However, in the present case I do not believe that the failure to discount the sentence by more than 20 per cent is alone an error vitiating his sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    28 The third ground is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. This ground relies upon the subjective features of the applicant, in particular the fact that she was on protection arising from an assault upon her by a fellow inmate armed with a syringe. However, evidence was placed before this Court on the basis that it may be necessary for the applicant to be resentenced which reveals that she is no longer on protection but is participating in a mother and child program. Although she still fears reprisals by the prisoner who attacked her or her associates, this is not a matter that warrants a reduction in the sentence imposed. Nor does the fact that she is stressed about pending custody proceedings in respect of her child. In my opinion there is nothing in the material itself which indicates that the sentencing discretion miscarried or can justify interference by this Court absent error being shown. 
     
      
    29 The applicant needs little by way of rehabilitation except so far as her drug usage is concerned. On the other hand there was a real need for the sentence to denounce the applicant’s conduct and reflect general deterrence, both because of the nature of the offences and because a government instrumentality, Medicare, was involved. 
     
      
    30 The criminality of the applicant was very high, notwithstanding the relatively modest amount of money obtained. I do not believe that the amount of the fraud is as decisive in an assessment of the criminality of the offender or the appropriate sentence as was urged upon us by Ms Burgess. The fact that other matters dealt with in the District Court and finding their way to this Court have involved considerably more loss to the victims does not indicate that the sentence is outside of the available range. The number of charges and the benefit obtained is merely one factor to be considered in all the circumstances of the case before the court. 
     
      
    31 Some of the cases referred to in the applicant’s written submissions are positively misleading if only the bare facts and the sentences imposed are considered. For example, in respect to the case of R v Fraser [2000] NSWCCA 97, the summary in the submissions does not disclose that the offender in that case received a third discount of the sentence because of assistance in respect of the prosecution of another offender. In respect of R v Montesinos [2002] NSWCCA 470 the summary does not reveal that the applicant received a suspended sentence because of her mental illness. 
     
      
    32 The applicant also relied upon statistics in both the Local and District Courts. The statistics in relation to the Local Court matters are in my view irrelevant. Those in relation to the District Court showed that the sentence imposed upon the applicant came within the top 38 per cent of sentences for offences of this nature. I do not find that result supportive of the argument that the sentence was outside the appropriate range when nothing is known about the amount of money involved, the nature of the frauds or the extent of the criminality in those cases. It does show, however, that the sentence was a heavy one and at the very top of his Honour’s discretion, but I am not satisfied that it exceeded it. I find no assistance from a comparison of non-parole period’s so as to suggest that there is a range in relation to that part of a sentence against which a particular sentence should be judged. 
     
      
    33 There was a particular attack upon the sentence imposed for count 34. This was the offence upon which the Form 1 matters were ultimately taken into account. That count related to a false claim on the HCF for $148. It was submitted that a sentence of imprisonment for 3½ years was manifestly excessive having regard to the nature of the offence. But the sentence for that offence took into account the sixty matters on the Form 1 and the sentence imposed did not have to be proportionate to the criminality involved in the offence alone, disregarding the Form 1 matters. A submission to that effect was, as I understand it, ultimately withdrawn. 
     
      
    34 It was also argued that the sentence for that count was too high because the offences on the Form 1 were offences related to counts for which the applicant was otherwise sentenced and that there was, in effect, a double punishment involved in taking into account offences committed as part of some other offence for which sentence was being passed. However, counsel was unable to indicate that any offence on the Form 1 was actually an element of some other offence for which the applicant was before the court. I do not accept that there is any unfairness or undue harshness in offences being taken into account where those offences were separate and distinct acts of criminality committed on the way to committing some other offence for which she was being sentenced. For my part, I believe that there is a significant difference in criminality between, on the one hand, forging a document and then using it to perpetrate a fraud, and, on the other hand, perpetrating a fraud by using a document which is itself not fraudulent. 
     
      
    35 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

      12153/2003 – DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v David Christopher BURROW & Anor 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 12 June 2003 the first defendant, David Christopher Burrow, appeared at the Local Court at Parramatta before the second defendant, a magistrate. He was to be dealt with for two charges of impersonating a police officer, an offence under s204 of the Police Act 1990, carrying a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and/or a substantial fine. On 6 November 2002 he had been convicted by another magistrate of two counts of committing an act of indecency, an offence under s61N(2) of the Crimes Act, for which he had been sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for twelve months, those terms being suspended under s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Pursuant to s12(1)(b) of that Act, he had been directed to enter into good behaviour bonds. The offences of impersonating a police officer constituted breaches of those bonds, and the question whether they should be revoked was also before the second defendant. 
     
      
    2 Her Honour convicted the first defendant of the charges of impersonating a police officer and imposed a fine of $2,500 on each of them. However, she declined to revoke the s12 bonds. The plaintiff, the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, has brought proceedings in this Court by way of appeal, or in the nature of an appeal, against that latter decision. 
     
      
    3 The facts of the two offences of impersonating a police officer are rather odd. In both of them the first defendant produced a New South Wales Police badge which, apparently, he had obtained from a wall plaque which he had purchased from the Goulburn Police Academy. The first offence was committed outside the Penrith railway station in the evening of 29 May 2003. He approached a man who appeared to be trying to break into parked cars, claimed to be a police officer, took the man’s particulars in a notebook and appeared to check those particulars by a call on his mobile phone. He then told the man to behave himself and took no further action. 
     
      
    4 The second offence occurred on the afternoon of 3 June 2003, when he produced the badge to gain access to Penrith railway station without purchasing a rail ticket. It seems that his only purpose was to enter the station and he did not intend to travel on the train without a ticket. 
     
      
    5 The first defendant’s legal representative in the Local Court noted that these offences were the only breaches of the s12 bonds, and told her Honour that he had been observing the other conditions imposed by those bonds. He tendered a letter from his client’s wife, which attested to his general good character and from which it was apparent that she remained loyal to him and supportive of him. She wrote that they were involved together in a small business which could not survive without him, and asked her Honour not to send him to gaol.  
     
      
    6 Having heard submissions from the first defendant’s legal representative and having read the letter, her Honour announced that she would “take no action on the s12 breaches.” She continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I note that the matters before the Court while certainly not trivial are unrelated it would seem to the matters for which that term of imprisonment which (sic) the s12 suspension was imposed. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court is no way trivialising the two impersonating police matters, I fail to understand how somebody can order badges, it would seem, from the police academy. Be that as it may, the Court will impose heavy monetary penalties. I note the defendant is a working man with his own business, and has the ability to pay fines.” 
        
       
      
    7 Her Honour then imposed the fines to which I have referred, together with court costs, and allowed time to pay. She also noted that the first defendant had a prior entry for impersonating a police officer on his record, which had also attracted a heavy fine.  
     
      
    8 I shall turn later to the forms of relief sought by the plaintiff. To understand the plaintiff’s complaint, it is necessary to look at some of the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act dealing with suspended sentences.  
     
      
    9 Provision for suspended sentences is to be found in s12, the relevant part of which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “12(1) A court that imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender (being a sentence for a term of not more than 2 years) may make an order: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) suspending execution of the whole of the sentence for such period (not exceeding the term of the sentence) as the court may specify in the order, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) directing that the offender be released from custody on condition that the offender enters into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding the term of the sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    10 Section 98 provides generally for proceedings for breach of a good behaviour bond. Subsection (3) of that section deals with a s12 bond, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “98(3) In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in s12, a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond.” 
        
       
      
    11 The consequences of the revocation of a s12 bond are to be found in s99(1)(c): 
     
      
       
        
        “99(1) If a court revokes a good behaviour bond: 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (c) in the case of a bond referred to in section 12: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the order under section 12(1)(a) ceases to have effect in relation to the sentence of imprisonment suspended by the order, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) Part 4 applies to the sentence, except to the extent to which it has already applied in relation to setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) subject to the requirements of Part 4 having been complied with, the sentence takes effect.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Part 4 of the Act deals with terms of imprisonment. 
       
      
    12 No reference was made to s98(3) in the proceedings before her Honour. It is obvious that the decision not to revoke the bonds could not be justified under par (a) of the subsection, as her Honour made it clear that she did not see the offences of impersonating a police officer as trivial. If the decision could be supported, it would be only by the application of par (b). 
     
      
    13 In this Court counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Lakatos, argued that the only basis for that decision apparent from her Honour’s brief reasons is that the offences of impersonating a police officer, constituting the breaches of the bonds, were different in nature from the offences of committing an act of indecency the subject of the bonds. He submitted that, while that fact might be relevant to the question whether the bonds should be revoked, it could not of itself justify an exercise of the discretion under subs 3(b).14 Counsel for the first defendant, Mr O’Neill, submitted that par (b), in enabling a court to decline to revoke a bond if there were “good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure” to comply with its conditions, confers a wide discretion. He argued that the difference between an offence constituting a breach and the offence the subject of the bond might be sufficient to enliven that discretion. He referred to cases in other jurisdictions where such a difference, although not the only factor, was considered to be significant: R v Moylan [1970] 1 QB 143, R v Marston (1993) 60 SASR 320, and R v Holcroft [1997] 2 Qd.R. 392.  
     
      
    15 However, Moylan and Holcroft were dealing with legislation materially different from that in New South Wales. In both cases the relevant provision enabled the court to take no action on the breach if “it would be unjust to do so in view of all the circumstances that have arisen” since the suspended sentence was passed. Marston was concerned with legislation relevantly similar to the New South Wales provision, but the difference between the offence constituting the breach and the offence the subject of the bond was but one of a number of matters to which the court had regard: see the judgment of King CJ at 321-2. 
     
      
    16 However, Mr O’Neill also submitted that, in the context of the record of the proceedings as a whole, her Honour’s reasons should not be read in the confined way for which Mr Lakatos contended. It does appear that neither her Honour nor the first defendant’s legal representative maintained a clear distinction between the issue of the appropriate penalty for the offences of impersonating a police officer, on the one hand, and the question of the revocation of the s12 bonds, on the other. Rather, both matters were addressed in a global manner. In addition, her Honour’s judgment followed immediately upon the first defendant’s legal representative’s address, during which she asked questions and made comments which could throw some light upon her reasons. 
     
      
    17 Viewed in this way, Mr O’Neill argued, her Honour’s reasons for directing no action on the bonds emerge as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) The offences of impersonating a police officer were different in nature from those the subject of the bonds; 
       
       
      (b) The circumstances of those offences were unusual and the first defendant had come by the police badge lawfully; 
       
       
      (c) Those offences were to be dealt with by heavy fines; 
       
       
      (d) The first defendant had been compliant with other conditions of the bonds; 
       
       
      (e) He could rely upon the favourable matters in his wife’s letter; 
       
       
      (f) In particular, he was involved with his wife in a business to which his contribution was essential; 
       
       
      (g) In all those circumstances, it was inappropriate at that stage to send him to gaol. 
       
      
    18 Mr O’Neill submitted that the combination of these factors could amount to “good reasons” within the meaning of s98(3)(b). For present purposes I am prepared to accept that her Honour’s reasons might be fleshed out in that way. Whether those reasons address the question posed by subs 3(b), however, is another matter. 
     
      
    19 Section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides for a good behaviour bond instead of the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. Section 98(2) confers an unfettered discretion upon a court to take no action in respect of a breach of a bond of that kind. In his second reading speech prior to the passage of the Act, the responsible minister noted the difference between a suspended sentence and a s9 bond when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Suspended sentences involve the court imposing a sentence of imprisonment and then suspending its operation and releasing the offender on specified conditions. The offender is liable to a term of detention if the conditions are breached. 
        
       
       
        
        The primary purpose of suspended sentences is to denote the seriousness of the offence and the consequences of re-offending, whilst at the same time providing an opportunity, by good behaviour, to avoid the consequences. The impact on the offender is, however, weightier than that of a bond.”

    20 A helpful examination of the nature of a suspended sentence, with reference to relevant authority, and of its place in the sentencing scheme created by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, is to be found in the judgment of Howie J in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [23] ff. His Honour observed at [31]:-  
     
      
       
        
        “As s5 of the Act 
          
        recognises, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is a grave step for a court to take whether or not the offender’s liberty is immediately removed or curtailed. … A sentencing court, therefore, must recognise that a sentence of imprisonment can be a significant and effective punishment even where the execution of that sentence is suspended…That is why, in the hierarchy of sentencing alternatives, a suspended sentence is considered as more severe than a community service order even though it may appear on its face to be less punitive.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour continued at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, a sentencing court must approach the imposition of a sentence that is suspended on the basis that it can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender. Of course it must also be recognised that the fact that the execution of the sentence is to be immediately suspended will deprive the punishment of much of its effectiveness in this regard because it is a significantly more lenient penalty than any other sentence of imprisonment. The question of whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general or specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. It is perhaps trite to observe that, although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    22 Put shortly, while it is well adapted to the rehabilitation of an offender, the suspended sentence remains a salutary punishment. In large part, this is because normally the offender cannot escape commitment to prison if he or she is in breach of the associated bond. In Marston (supra) King CJ had this to say (at 322): 
     
      
       
        
        “I repeat what I said in  
        R v Buckman 
         (1988) 47 SASR 303 at 304: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘There is a clear legislative policy that in general a breach of a condition of a recognisance upon which a sentence has been suspended, should result in the offender serving the sentence which was suspended. A sentence of imprisonment is imposed and suspended only where imprisonment is fully merited but the court considers it appropriate to give the offender a last chance to avoid imprisonment by leading a law-abiding life. It is intended to be a sanction suspended over the head of the offender which is to be activated if there is a lapse into non-law-abiding ways. The court will not lightly interfere with the ordinary consequence of a breach of the recognisance.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        It is of great importance that the courts adhere to that principle. Departure from it by the non-revocation of suspended sentences tends to undermine the integrity of the system of suspended sentences and their effectiveness as a means of deterring future offenders.” 
        
       
      
    23 It is against this background that s98(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act must be understood. The subsection mandates the revocation of a s12 bond in the event of breach unless the court finds one or other of the exceptions expressed in it. Clearly, the legislature intended that a court should have much less room to move with a s12 bond than it has by s98(2) with a s9 bond. Unless a significant breach of a s12 bond normally leads to its revocation, the suspended sentence would be deprived of its salutary quality and of its viability as a sentencing option for serious offences. 
     
      
    24 The question posed by s98(3)(b) is whether “there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond”. Where the breach of the conditions of the bond is a further offence, this requires the court to focus upon the circumstances of that offence. Mr Lakatos postulated the example of a man who drives with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood, but only for the purpose of taking his pregnant wife to hospital after she has unexpectedly gone into labour. That could well be such a case, although this is not to suggest that par (b) is confined to offences with extenuating circumstances of that kind. It is a matter about which generalisation is not possible, and whether the paragraph might properly be invoked must depend on the facts of the case at hand.  
     
      
    25 Where the offence is relatively minor, it might be appropriate to weigh its gravity against the consequences of revocation of the bond, particularly where the suspended sentence is a long one. One of the matters to which King CJ had regard in Marston (at 322) was the “marked disproportion between the seriousness of the breaching offence and the length of the sentence which is activated by the revocation of the suspension”. (Of course, I am not speaking here of offences which are trivial in their nature, for which separate provision is made in par (a).)  
     
      
    26 An assessment of the seriousness of the offence constituting the breach may require that regard be had to the offender’s subjective circumstances. However, in my view, par (b) does not permit the excuse of such a breach by reason only of his or her subjective circumstances at the time a court is considering revocation of the bond. Nor, it seems to me, can the court have regard to the severity of the penalty to be imposed for the fresh offence.  
     
      
    27 It is clear that in the present case her Honour did not approach the question of the revocation of the first defendant’s bond with an eye to s98(3)(b) [although it seems that she did have regard to par (a)]. This is an error warranting the intervention of this Court and the matter must be remitted to the Local Court for further consideration. Given the unusual nature of the offences of impersonating a police officer, it might yet be open to avoid revocation of the bonds by the application of subs (3). About that matter I express no view.  
     
      
    28 This brings me, then, to the forms of relief sought. The plaintiff has appealed against her Honour’s decision under s56(1) of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001, which enables a prosecutor to appeal on a question of law against a variety of magistrates’ decisions set out in the subsection. One of those is “a sentence imposed by a Local Court in any summary proceeding”: subs1(a). Mr Lakatos submitted that her Honour’s refusal to revoke the first defendant’s bonds amounts to a “sentence” within the extended meaning afforded to that expression by the definition in s3 of that Act. To determine whether that is so would require a careful examination of the terms of that definition. However, I find it unnecessary to decide that matter because I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to the alternative form of relief sought. 
     
      
    29 The plaintiff also claims relief of a prerogative nature, seeking declarations and orders setting aside her Honour’s decision and remitting the proceedings to the Local Court to be heard and determined according to law. Relief of this kind may be granted where there has been a constructive failure by a magistrate to exercise his or her jurisdiction: Saffron v DPP (1989) 16 NSWLR 397, per Priestley JA at 418. For the reasons I have given, this is such a case. 
     
      
    30 It is unnecessary to set out the terms of the declarations and orders sought in the summons. It appears to me that the orders sought in pars 3 and 4 are appropriate but, in the light of my reasons, further thought might need to be given to the terms of any declaration. I shall consult the parties before making any declaration or any formal order and, if necessary, hear argument on costs.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HULME J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: On 25 July 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment which contained a single count alleging, in effect, that on 15 January 2002 he committed the offence of affray in licensed premises at Bradbury. The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty is contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. 
     
      
    4 Judge Maguire sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 2 years and specified a non-parole period of 18 months. The sentence commenced on 23 October 2003, the date sentence was passed, and the applicant was due to be released to parole on 22 April 2005. However, he was granted bail by the Supreme Court on 12 December 2003 and has been at liberty since that date. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
      
    5 On 15 January 2002 members of the public, including families with young children, were enjoying a trivia competition at the Bradbury Inn Tavern. The applicant, his two brothers and other young men arrived at the hotel at about 8pm and commenced consuming alcohol. At about 9.45pm an altercation took place in which the applicant and his brother were involved with patrons and hotel staff. The Crown’s allegation is that the applicant’s brother, Attila, was the major participant in the fracas, at least so far as the applicant’s group was concerned. He has been charged with a number of offences arising from the incident including, affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. At the time the applicant was sentenced, his brother had been committed for trial on the charges against him. 
     
      
    6 So far as the applicant is concerned the allegation is that he was a participant in the various brawls that took place, usually close to his brother. In particular it was alleged that he struck a male patron before becoming involved in a scuffle with a number of men, ultimately being rescued by his brother. 
     
      
    7 The applicant and his brother made a tactical withdrawal from the premises, but before they did, the brother allegedly threatened a hotel employee and obtained the security tape that recorded his conduct during the melee. The applicant and his brother were followed by a person from the hotel and shortly thereafter were arrested by police. The security tape was found nearby in a garden. The applicant’s brother has also been charged with demanding the videotape from a club employee with menaces. 
     
      
    8 A statement of facts was tendered together with the Crown brief of witness statements. The statement of facts contained the following under the heading, “Case against the offender Sebastian Fajka”: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Surveillance footage from the inn on that night shows the offender, Sebastian FAJKA, in close vicinity to where fights were occurring, and usually close to his brother Attila FAJKA. It is evidence that the offender is not merely a bystander as he is witnessed on at least one occasion striking an unidentified male patron, and then becoming involved in a scuffle. 
         
        
       
      Under a heading “Case against the co-offender Attila FAJKA” there was set out a general allegation that he threatened and used violence toward others at the Tavern. The facts then listed in point form a number of particular allegations made against the brother which included him striking or assaulting persons, both named and unnamed, and the demand on the employee for the videotape. 
       
      
    9 The applicant was aged 31 at the date of sentence. He is married with two young children. At the time of sentencing he was working seven days a week. He was employed full time with a telecommunications company selling international phone cards to companies for which he received a wage and commission. His wife and he had also invested in a franchise selling telephone cards and at the time of sentencing he was establishing the business without receiving much in the way of financial benefit from it. He worked each weekend in promoting his business. 
     
      
       
      The applicant’s subjective case 
      
    10 A pre-sentence report revealed that the applicant had a history of cannabis and alcohol abuse but in June 2000 had entered into a residential rehabilitation programme at Odyssey House. He told the probation officer, and gave evidence before his Honour, that he had been drug free since completing 16 months of the programme. He admitted to consuming alcohol occasionally. The report contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Discussion with the offender’s wife confirmed his stated abstinence and reduced alcohol intake. The offender’s wife indicated that the offender had made significant progress over the past year, had gained full time employment and had made attempts to lead a drug free law abiding lifestyle. 
         
        
       
      
    11 A number of testimonials were tendered from the applicant’s employer and other members of the community. 
     
      
    12 The applicant had a criminal record that commenced in 1995 with a PCA offence. There were two offences of obtaining property by false pretences for which he was fined in 1997. The majority of his appearances before the Local Court were for driving matters although in 2000 he was fined $800 for an assault. The most serious offence was one of negligent driving causing death for which he was ordered to perform community service. To describe this history as his Honour did as a “record for offences of dishonesty, violence and driving” was, with respect, to suggest that the applicant’s criminal antecedents were more serious than they were. 
     
      
       
      The applicant’s evidence 
      
    13 The applicant gave evidence before his Honour. It is clear that, despite his plea, the applicant was maintaining that his actions were not unlawful and that he was acting in self-defence from attacks upon him by others at the hotel. However, he indicated to his Honour that he was pleading guilty because he was involved. 
     
      
    14 The applicant was asked what he wanted to say about the offence and replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I regret being involved in the brawl. All I can say I’m sorry for the incident and that’s basically it. 
        
       
       
      He denied having started the brawl. He said he received a blow to the head during the fight and received bruises and concussion. He was cross-examined at length about his brother’s conduct. He denied that his brother had started the fight or that he was the major offender. He accepted that his brother was more involved than he was but denied having seen the incidents giving rise to the particular allegations made against his brother in the statement of facts. 
       
      
    15 At one stage, after the transcript of evidence of the police officer given at committal proceedings was tendered by Mr Farmer, who appeared for the applicant, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
         
        FARMER: Well your Honour I’m trying to focus on the case involving my client as opposed to the case that my learned friend seems to be focusing on involving Attila Fajka. Now I……. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: But have you looked at the Act? 
         
         
        FARMER: Yes I understand - 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: “[If] two or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purpose of sub section 1”. That is, the conduct of the brother is admissible on the question of guilt or not. 
         
         
        FARMER: Yes 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: And therefore it must be evidence on the question of penalty. 
         
         
        FARMER: I understand your Honour. My focus is directed to the principle that when one comes to sentencing in cases of affray your Honour is entitled to distinguish between the actual roles of the different person involved in the affray. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Its quite clear that Attila was more violent than your client. 
         
         
        FARMER: Indeed. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: But it is quite clear equally that your client identified himself with his brother. He left the premises with him - 
         
         
        FARMER: He did. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: --left the premises with him knowing that his brother had stolen the surveillance video. He was arrested near the place where the stolen video was located. Now all of that is a mark against him. 
         
         
        FARMER: Yes your Honour I understand that but as I say your Honour I want to focus on his actual involvement in the affray itself and I understand he’s aligned with the brother……….. 
         
        
       
       
      That part of the  
      Crimes Act 
       quoted by his Honour during this exchange was s 93C(2). 
       
      
    16 Shortly after this exchange defence counsel recalled the applicant to give further evidence. His Honour continued questioning the applicant about the conduct of his brother and, in particular, the taking of the video. The applicant denied that he heard his brother say, “Come on I’ve got the tape let’s go we will get rid of it”. The applicant said at the time it was chaotic and people were screaming. 
     
      
    17 His Honour’s questions continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. When he [the brother] was handcuffed did you hear him say to the detective or to the police officer, “You black cunt, take these cuffs off and I’ll have you”? 
         
         
        A. Sorry for laughing your Honour. 
         
         
        Q. You find that funny do you? 
         
         
        A. No’ cause I just can’t see that – him saying that. 
         
         
        Q. Why – you don’t see people saying things, you hear them? 
         
         
        A. Okay I didn’t hear him say that your Honour. 
         
         
        Q. Why were you laughing? 
         
         
        A. Just the language that was used just now. 
        
       
      
    18 With respect, I fail to understand how it could possibly be a relevant matter whether the applicant heard his brother use offensive and threatening language to the arresting police officer or not. There was nothing about the charge that made the applicant responsible for all that his brother said or did during the night simply because he happened to be in his presence. Yet, the Crown put a number of propositions to the applicant, presumably on the basis of Brown v Dunne (1893) 6 R 67, that were in my view completely irrelevant to the sentencing exercise, including that he had heard his brother make the comment to which the sentencing judge had referred. 
     
      
    19 It seems to me that there was a real danger arising from the conduct of the proceedings, and particularly the cross-examination of the applicant by the sentencing judge and the prosecutor, of the applicant being punished for the brother’s conduct rather than his own. And so it transpired, when regard is had to the sentencing remarks and the penalty imposed. 
     
      
       
      The stolen videotape 
      
    20 The first ground of appeal relates to his Honour’s findings as to the applicant’s involvement in the taking of the videotape. Obviously, as his Honour recognised, the applicant was not charged with any offence in relation to this incident: nor could he be. There was no evidence of a joint enterprise between his brother and him to take the tape. Yet a not insignificant amount of the brief remarks on sentence was taken up with this matter. 
     
      
    21 During his remarks Judge Maguire quoted a passage from the statement of a witness as to what she had seen and heard in relation to the taking of the tape. The part of the statement quoted followed an account of an apology made by the applicant to that witness for what had happened. His Honour made no reference in his remarks to the apology. However, during defence counsel’s address and after his Honour was referred to the apology, the sentencing judge drew counsel’s attention to what the witness said about the brother stealing the tape and the applicant leaving the hotel with him. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I’m not going to punish him for stealing the tape, clearly he didn’t, but his identification with the thief of the tape who has evinced a wish to destroy the evidence against him suggest to me that there is no genuine apology. 
         
        
       
      With respect to his Honour, such a line of reasoning was simply not open for a number of reasons, not the least being that it was not logical. 
       
      
    22 But it is clear from the passage quoted by his Honour in his sentencing remarks, that the brother had gone downstairs and taken the tape while the applicant was talking to the witness to whom he was apologising. The fact that, when the brother returned, he informed the applicant that he had the tape and said, “Let’s go. We will get rid of it” did not make the applicant party to a joint enterprise in relation to the theft of the tape simply because he then left with his brother. His Honour appeared to think that it was significant that, although the witness was cross-examined at committal proceedings, she was not questioned about the tape. Two observations can be made about this remark: firstly, that part of the committal transcript was not in evidence and, secondly, the failure to question her about the matter was probably because what she said about the tape was irrelevant to the case against the applicant. 
     
      
    23 Yet his Honour stated in the course of his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        There is no doubt in my mind that the offender acted jointly with his brother in removing the stolen tape from the premises in an attempt to destroy evidence useful to the prosecution. 
        
       
       
      In my view his Honour was not entitled to come to that finding or use it in any way to the prejudice of the applicant. The applicant was neither charged with taking the tape nor with attempting to pervert the course of justice. His Honour did not indicate what use he made of this finding, but it was clearly a matter that was being taken into account to the applicant’s detriment in some undefined and unexplained manner. 
       
      
    24 The Crown has argued that his Honour was entitled to make both the finding that he did and to take it into account. It is unnecessary for present purposes to examine in fine detail the principle in De Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383 and its application. However, I have considerable doubt that a sentencing court would be entitled to take into account an allegation of a serious criminal offence, uncharged by the Crown and denied by the offender, when sentencing that offender for an offence of a completely different nature to that alleged. Whether the court can do so may depend upon the purpose for which the finding is to be made. In the present case his Honour in effect found that the applicant was party to an attempt to destroy evidence, an offence contrary to s 317(a) and which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. If his Honour was using that as an aggravating feature of the offence, then I do not understand how it can be said that to do so does not infringe the principle in De Simoni or common fairness. 
     
      
       
      The conduct of the applicant 
      
    25 It is submitted that his Honour erred in his assessment of the applicant’s conduct and, in particular, in finding that the applicant had assaulted more persons than the one unidentified person referred to in the statement of facts. 
     
      
    26 The applicant had during his evidence accepted that he had struck an Asian person although he maintained it was in self-defence. The evidence was that thereafter there was a scuffle between the applicant, the Asian man and another who intervened. His Honour in his remarks described the applicant’s behaviour as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He admits to fighting, although I am conscious that he told me on his oath that he struck only one other person, that being an Asian gentleman who he claims was as large as himself. That seems unlikely. I noticed in the Probation and Parole Service report which was tendered only this morning that he is recorded by the probation officer as having agreed that he assaulted others. 
         
         
        I am persuaded that his role in this affair was an active one and that he was quite prepared to identify himself with his brother, who started the brawl for the basest of reasons, and took a more active part in it than did this offender. 
         
        
       
      
    27 It seems to me, with respect, that too much was made throughout the sentencing hearing of the conduct of the brother rather than focusing, as his counsel sought to have the judge do, on the conduct of the applicant. The brother was charged with a number of offences, including, somewhat surprisingly, two counts of affray. The applicant did not become liable for all that his brother had done, either because of the nature of the charge of affray or because, in his Honour’s words, “he was quite prepared to identify himself with his brother”. If that phrase meant that he became involved in order to assist his brother or to take his brother’s part in disputes with the hotel guests, then it might be accurate. But if it suggests that by participation in the brawl he adopted all that his brother did and in someway became criminally liable for it, that is not so. 
     
      
    28 Of course the applicant’s conduct had to be considered in the context of the fact that his brother had become involved in a brawl with guests and staff at the hotel on what was in effect a family occasion, with children present. But that was the limited basis upon which the brother’s conduct aggravated that of the applicant. Section 93(C)(2) does not mean, in my opinion, that the applicant was to be punished for all the conduct of both himself and his brother. Rather the section is concerned with ensuring that the conduct of the two of them is considered in determining whether that conduct “is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety”. 
     
      
    29 In a case such as the present the applicant could only be punished for that part of his and his brother’s conduct which gave rise to the offence of affray and not that conduct which also resulted in some other offence or offences being committed by the brother, for example an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In particular where the brother was charged with two offences of affray and the applicant only one offence, the sentencing court had to be careful not to take into account that part of the brother’s conduct that gave rise to the second offence with which the applicant was not charged. 
     
      
    30 It was unfortunate that this matter had not been sufficiently addressed at the hearing before his Honour and that the statement of facts contained allegations against the brother that were, in my view, not admissible against the applicant as aggravating his offence. If the sentencing judge was going to sentence the applicant for some matter outside the particulars relied upon in the statement of facts under the heading referring to the applicant, then he should have raised this matter with the defence and given the applicant the opportunity of meeting it. The ground is in substance made out. 
     
      
       
      The applicant’s contrition 
      
    31 I have referred earlier to the applicant’s statement in evidence as to his regret at being involved in the brawl. There was also evidence of an apology to one person at the hotel before he left with his brother. His Honour said in his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        When he was asked by his counsel what he had to say about his involvement in the brawl, the offender uttered the barest pro forma expression of contrition. I do not accept him as being sincere in this regard. 
         
        
       
      
    32 With respect to his Honour this seems unduly harsh. I am not sure what it was expected that the applicant might say other than he did. It was not as if he was asked by his counsel whether he was sorry and answered “yes”, as is so often the case. True it is that he did not accept that he was acting unlawfully but there was little reason to doubt that he was remorseful for his involvement in the fight in light of the apology he made on the night in question. There was more force in his Honour’s finding that he had not faced up to his responsibility for his actions. 
     
      
    33 But the significant matter raised in respect of this ground of appeal is the failure by the sentencing judge to refer to any discount for the plea of guilty, either generally or by reference to a percentage reduction in the sentence during the course of his remarks. When counsel raised the discount for the plea in address, and admitted it was a late plea, his Honour remarked, “What after committal?” Thereafter, while counsel was addressing the judge as to the discount for the plea of guilty, there was no further response on that matter from his Honour. 
     
      
    34 It should be a very rare case where a sentencing judge does not indicate that he or she is giving a discount for a plea of guilty. It is important that the offender believes that the plea of guilty has been taken into account, and a judge should expressly indicate that it has been. With judges experienced in the criminal jurisdiction it might well be the case that this Court would not be prepared to find that so significant a matter could possibly have been overlooked. Very often the sentence itself will reveal whether and to what degree a discount must have been given. In the present case as I am of the view that the sentence is manifestly excessive, it is unnecessary to determine whether this was due to a failure to take into account the plea of guilty or some other error that I have found established. However, I am far from confident that the applicant did receive a discount for the plea even to the extent of, say, 10 per cent. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The applicant’s rehabilitation 
      
    35 I have already indicated that the applicant had overcome his reliance on prohibited drugs and alcohol by voluntarily undertaking an intensive rehabilitation course. The undisputed evidence was that he was at the time of sentencing no longer addicted to drugs or alcohol. I have earlier quoted that part of the report which referred to the wife’s impression of her husband’s attempts at reform. The report concluded with the following assessment by the officer: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Supervision is not warranted as the offender has to his credit made positive progress in addressing his past drug and alcohol problem and has addressed underlying issues. 
        
       
      
    36 It was never suggested to the applicant during evidence that he was still abusing alcohol or that any attempts at reform and rehabilitation were not genuine. It was never suggested by His Honour to counsel appearing for the applicant that he harboured any doubts about the applicant’s rehabilitation either up to the date of sentencing or beyond. Yet his Honour stated in his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As to rehabilitation, I have grave reservations. Whilst I accept his evidence about his recovery in Odyssey House, it is apparent, not only from the Probation and Parole report, that he is still drinking. The present case makes it clear that he does not have proper control over his behaviour. 
         
        
       
      
    37 In an attempt to support his Honour’s assessment the Crown points to the fact that the applicant was in breach of a community service order at the time of the offence. However, his Honour did not refer to that matter at any stage in his remarks or otherwise, the applicant was never asked about it, no breach proceedings had been taken, and it did not seem to affect the officer’s assessment. 
     
      
    38 With respect, his Honour’s view of the applicant’s rehabilitation was unfair and unjust. It was unfair, because the issue had never been raised with the applicant or his counsel. It was unjust, because it was plainly inconsistent with the unchallenged assessment of the probation officer, based no doubt on the records of the service as well as the officer’s investigations. I do not understand how his Honour could have any reservations about the applicant’s rehabilitation, at least since the commission of the offence. If, as it seems, his Honour required complete abstinence from alcohol on the part of the applicant as proof of his rehabilitation, that was an unreasonable demand. If, as it seems, his Honour was judging the applicant’s efforts at rehabilitation by the commission of the offence, 18 months earlier, he was clearly in error by disregarding what had occurred since. 
     
      
       
      Sentence manifestly excessive 
      
    39 It should be clear by now that in my view the sentencing discretion was infected with serious error. Further the sentence itself was manifestly excessive both as to the head sentence and the non-parole period. True it is that the applicant had, by his desire to work seven days a week, made two sentencing options unavailable; community service and periodic detention. However, it seems to me a curious result, to say the least, that, because the Probation service declined to find him suitable for alternatives to full-time custody on the basis that it did not wish to interfere with his work commitments, it followed that the applicant had to be given a sentence of full-time custody because alternatives were not available. 
     
      
    40 On the basis that it may be necessary for the applicant to be re-sentenced the Court received affidavits from him and his wife about the effect of imprisonment upon him. It has clearly been the case that the six weeks in custody had a salutary effect upon him. His imprisonment also resulted in the collapse of the business that he and his wife had embarked upon. We were informed on the hearing of the appeal that the applicant has since his release secured a full-time position with a bank. 
     
      
    41 At the conclusion of argument the Court indicated that it was minded to allow the appeal and consider some other course than full-time custody if it determined that a gaol sentence was warranted. With this in mind the matter was stood over to today so that the applicant could be assessed as to whether he is now suitable for either periodic detention or some non-custodial order. The Court has been informed that the applicant is suitable for both periodic detention and community service order. 
     
      
    42 In this case the sentence that I propose should now be imposed cannot be regarded as necessarily a guide to what otherwise would be an appropriate sentence for an affray occurring in circumstances similar to the present matter. This is for three principal reasons. 
     
      
    43 Firstly, the evidence before the sentencing judge which could be properly taken into account indicated a very limited role of the applicant in the affray commenced by his brother. On that material, it is apparent that the fear engendered in the persons present was very largely a result of the conduct of his brother and not the applicant. 
     
      
    44 Secondly, the applicant has served seven weeks in full time custody for an offence that the Crown now accepts on the material before his Honour did not warrant a full time custodial sentence. 
     
      
    45 Thirdly, the applicant is now in my view completely rehabilitated and the characteristics of the person who committed the offence are not the characteristics of the person who is now being sentenced. 
     
      
    46 In these circumstances I propose that leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be allowed. The sentence imposed by Judge Maguire should be quashed and in lieu the applicant ordered to perform 100 hours community service.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 3 October 2002, Pain J in the Land and Environment Court found the appellant guilty of the following charge brought under s.125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (the Act), namely that: 
     
      
       
        
        On about 21 November 2001 at North Ryde in the State of New South Wales the Defendant did carry out development for a purpose prohibited by an environmental planning instrument, namely use the premises known as 1A and 1B Kent Road, North Ryde, which premises are zoned Residential 2A under the Ryde Planning Scheme Ordinance, for the purpose of a residential flat building, being a purpose prohibited under Clause 23 of the said Ordinance, contrary to s.76B of the said Act.  
        
       
      
    2 On 1 November 2002, the primary judge made the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The Defendant is convicted of the offence of which he is charged. 
         
         
        2. The Defendant is fined the sum of $7,500 to be paid to the Registrar of the Court within 28 days of today’s date. 
         
         
        3. The Defendant must pay the Prosecutor’s costs of the proceedings against him, as agreed or assessed. 
        
       
      
    3 The appellant appeals to this Court against his conviction, and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.  
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    4 The appellant is the registered proprietor of a duplex building, comprising two two-storey buildings joined by garages, known as 1A and 1B Kent Road North Ryde, being Lots 91 and 92 in Deposited Plan No.873146.  
     
      
    5 This property is and was at 21 November 2001 affected by controls imposed by the Ryde Planning Scheme Ordinance, under which it was zoned Residential 2A. Within that zone, the purposes for which the buildings may not be erected or used included “residential flat buildings”, a term defined in the Ordinance to mean a “building containing two or more dwellings”. The term “dwelling” is defined to mean “a room or suite of rooms occupied or used or so constructed or adapted as to be capable of being occupied or used as a separate domicile”.  
     
      
    6 At the hearing before the primary judge, there was evidence from a Council officer that on 21 November 2001 there were four mail boxes outside the property, bearing numbers 1/1A, 2/1A, 2/1B and 1/1B; and that on each of the entrance doors to the street there were two bells. 
     
      
    7 There was evidence from a tenant of 1B to the effect that at that time he lived on the ground floor in premises comprising two bedrooms, a living/lounge room, kitchen, two showers and a bathroom, pursuant to a lease arranged with the appellant; and that there were premises upstairs in 1B which were occupied by another person, with similar accommodation, except that the upstairs premises had two toilets. Each of the two collections of rooms had its own lockable front door. This tenant and his wife had lived on the ground floor since November 1999; and another family had lived upstairs from about the same time until about the middle of 2001. The other person who was living there on 21 November 2001 had moved into the upstairs rooms in about October 2001. 
     
      
    8 There was evidence that there was similar accommodation in 1A, and that the appellant and his family lived downstairs in that house at that time. There was evidence that tenants had lived upstairs in 1A since about August 2000. 
     
      
    9 The building had been built pursuant to a building application made in 1996, showing two two-storey houses, joined by garages. There had been no relevant application to the Council for conversion of the building so as to be adapted for use for flats. 
     
      
    10 One tenancy agreement in evidence showed the landlord as being a company, of which the appellant was a director, described the premises as “ground floor unit” in 1B Kent Road, and showed the rental as being $1000 every four weeks. 
     
      
    11 After inspection by a Council officer on 21 November 2001, the Council required that the use as residential flat building cease and that certain changes be made to the buildings.  
     
      
    12 On 12 February 2002, the Council determined that works undertaken on 1A Kent Road meant that there was no reason for an order to be issued on that address. However this was not the case in relation to 1B Kent Road, and on 28 March 2002 an order was issued by the Council to the appellant to cease using those premises as a residential flat building, and to demolish or remove the kitchen facilities from the first floor and to remove the lockable doors from the ground floor and first floor areas. On 2 April 2002 a Council inspector found that that order had been complied in respect of 1B Kent Road. 
     
      
    13 The appellant gave evidence before the primary judge that he had changed the configuration of the small bedrooms upstairs in 1A and 1B Kent Road to make them into an alcove with a bar, and that he had approached the Council at the time and been told he did not need development consent. He said these changes were to increase the amenity for tenants in 1A and 1B, and that the arrangements were that the tenants in 1B were to share the entirety of the premises. That was contrary to evidence given by the tenant of 1B to which I have referred, and the primary judge accepted the evidence of that tenant. 
     
      
    14 The primary judge found beyond reasonable doubt that 1A and 1B were being used as residential flat buildings on 21 November 2001, and convicted the appellant. 
     
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    15 The appellant relies on the following grounds of Appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned Judge failed to have full regard to the express provisions of section 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and in particular failed to have full regard to the words “ 
        …and that matter or thing if so directed to be done remains undone… 
        ”. 
         
         
        2. The learned Judge failed to have full regard to the express provisions of section 127(6) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and in particular failed to have regard to the time bar being the 12 month limitation period in which the Prosecutor had to bring proceedings from the date of the commission of the offence. 
         
         
        3. Her Honour failed to properly apply the principles contained in section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in sentencing the Applicant. 
         
        
       
      
    16 I will deal first with the appeal against conviction, and then with the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
       
      APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION 
       
      Statutory Provisions 
      
    17 The following provisions of the Act are relevant to the appeal against conviction. Section 4 of the Act contains the following definition of “development”: 
     
      
       
        
        development means: 
         
        (a) the use of land, and 
         
        (b) the subdivision of land, and 
         
        (c) the erection of a building, and 
         
        (d) the carrying out of a work, and  
         
        (e) the demolition of a building or work, and 
         
        (f) any other act, matter or thing referred to in section 26 that is controlled by an environmental planning instrument,  
         
        but does not include any development of a class or description prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this definition. 
        
       
      
    18 Section 76B of the Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        If an environmental planning instrument provides that: 
         
        (a) specified development is prohibited on land to which the provision applies, or 
         
        (b) development cannot be carried out on land with or without development consent,  
         
        a person must not carry out the development on the land. 
         
        
       
      
    19 Section 125(1) of the Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Where any matter or thing is by or under this Act, other than by or under the regulations, directed or forbidden to be done, or where the Minister, the Director-General, a Council or any other person is authorised by or under this Act, other than by or under the regulations, to direct any matter or thing to be done, or to forbid any matter or thing to be done, and that matter or thing if so directed to be done remains undone, or if so forbidden to be done is done, a person offending against that direction or prohibition shall be guilty of an offence against this Act. 
        
       
      
    20 Section 127 of the Act, at the relevant date, provided to the effect that proceedings “may be commenced not later than 6 months after the offence was alleged to be committed”. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
      
    21 On ground 1 of the appeal against conviction, Mr Overall for the appellant submitted that, on the correct interpretation of s.125(1), there is no offence committed if relevant orders or directions issued by Council have been complied with. In this case, the appellant had complied with all the Council’s requirements by 18 April 2002.  
     
      
    22 Mr Overall submitted that the provision should be interpreted having regard to the intention of parliament, and with the mischief being addressed: NSW Crime Commission v Kelly [2003] NSWSC 56 at [10]-[11]. Relevantly, the mischief being addressed here was the bringing of prosecutions after Council’s requirements had been complied with; and the intention of Parliament was to allow a person in breach of the requirements of the Act or of directions by the Council to correct the breach and thereby avoid prosecution. In essence, the relevant breach under s.125(1) was the failure to comply with a direction given under the Act: see Rao v Canterbury City Council [2000] NSWCCA 471 at [73].  
     
      
    23 On the second ground, Mr Overall submitted the offence charged was carrying out development; and where, as in this case, the relevant development was use of land, the words “carry out” in s.76B indicated that the offence was committed when the relevant use commenced, and not at any later time.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    24 In my opinion, as submitted by Mr Leggat for the Respondent, s.125(1) provides four distinct basis of liability, namely:  
     
      
      (a) where the Act directs a person to do something; 
       
      (b) where the Act forbids a person doing something; 
       
      (c) where an authority (relying on a power under the Act) directs a person to do something; and 
       
      (d) where an authority (relying on a power under the Act) forbids a person doing something. 
       
      
    25 The use of the word “or” between each of these alternatives shows that they are intended to be alternatives grounds of liability. The second part of s.125(1), commencing “and that matter or thing…” then gives two different ways in which an offence can occur, namely:  
     
      
      (1) where something directed to be done remains undone; and 
       
      (2) where something forbidden to be done is done. 
       
      The first of these can occur only in relation to things which are positively directed to be done, that is in relation to (a) and (c) above; while the second can arise only in relation to things which are forbidden, that is alternatives (b) and (d) above. 
       
      
    26 The case of Rao dealt with a condition of a development approval forbidding something to be done; and that was treated by Austin J at [73] as involving a direction by the Council authorised by or under the Act forbidding something from being done. That statement by Austin J does not mean that there needs to be such a direction in all cases where s.125(1) is involved. Indeed, when one reads s.76B and s.125(1) together, it would be surprising if s.125(1) did not provide that a breach of s.76B was of itself an offence, irrespective of any additional direction that may be given. 
     
      
    27 The words “remains undone” in s.125(1) are plainly referring to a time by which a matter was directed to be done either by the Act or by an authority relying on a power under the Act. It is at that time when an offence is committed; and s.125(1) does not require that the relevant thing remain undone at the time a charge is brought or at the time of hearing. In any event, the charge in this case was not that something remained undone, but rather something forbidden had been done.  
     
      
    28 For those reasons, the first ground fails.  
     
      
    29 On the limitation question, it was established before the primary judge that the premises were being used by the appellant in contravention of the Ordinance on 21 November 2001, within 6 months of the prosecution being brought. The question then is, did the offence of carrying out the development, being the use of premises in contravention of the Ordinance, occur on 21 November 2001, or only when this use commenced.  
     
      
    30 In my opinion, there is the carrying out of development, being the use of land, for so long as that use of land continues. The use of land is a positive activity, and it would be surprising if what is prohibited by s.76B of the Act is only the commencement, and not the continued carrying on, of use in breach of an environmental planning instrument. Although the actual wording of s.76B is that a person must not “carry out” a use, in context this must include “carry on” a use. 
     
      
    31 Accordingly, the offence did occur on 21 November 2001, and the second ground also fails. 
     
      
       
      SENTENCE APPEAL 
       
      Statutory Provision 
      
    32 The application for leave to appeal against the sentence involves consideration of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s.10, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders:  
         
        (a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed, 
         
        (b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years, 
         
        (c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into an agreement to participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the program. 
         
         
        (2) An order referred to in subsection (1) (b) may be made if the court is satisfied:  
         
        (a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or 
         
        (b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond. 
         
         
        (2A) An order referred to in subsection (1) (c) may be made if the court is satisfied that it would reduce the likelihood of the person committing further offences by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of the person. 
         
         
        (2B) Subsection (1) (c) is subject to Part 8C. 
         
         
        (3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors:  
         
        (a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition, 
         
        (b) the trivial nature of the offence, 
         
        (c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, 
         
        (d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider. 
         
         
        (4) An order under this section has the same effect as a conviction:  
         
        (a) for the purposes of any law with respect to the revesting or restoring of stolen property, and 
         
        (b) for the purpose of enabling a court to give directions for compensation under Part 4 of the  
        Victims Compensation Act 1996 
        , and 
         
        (c) for the purpose of enabling a court to give orders with respect to the restitution or delivery of property or the payment of money in connection with the restitution or delivery of property. 
         
         
        (5) A person with respect to whom an order under this section is made has the same right to appeal on the ground that the person is not guilty of the offence as the person would have had if the person had been convicted of the offence. 
        
       
       
      Submissions 
      
    33 Mr Overall for the appellant noted that the primary judge said that there had been no application made under s.10 for the offence to be dismissed; but submitted that there was no requirement for such an application to be made. Her Honour went on to say that she would not have made such an order because she did not think that the offence could be described as trivial. Mr Overall submitted that, once the primary judge considered s.10, she was obliged to consider all the factors contained in s.10(3) specifically in terms of s.10, and not merely generally in exercising her sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    34 Mt Overall submitted that it was not necessary for s.10 to be applied that the offence be considered trivial: see R v Piccin (No 2) [2001] NSWCCA 323 at [25].  
     
      
    35 In this case there were matters falling within all four categories of s.10(3) that should have been considered. The appellant was of good character, had no prior convictions, and spent much of his time in service to his community. Whether or not the offence was considered trivial, it was at the low end of criminality, and there was no victim and no damage to the environment. There were extenuating circumstances, in particular in that there was now compliance with all requirements of the Council. Other matters proper to consider included the circumstance that the appellant had suffered a vast amount of press publicity, causing him, as a Councillor of the respondent, great harm. He had incurred substantial legal costs. No other case could be identified where someone had been prosecuted after complying with Council’s requirement.  
     
      
    36 Having regard to all these considerations, not only was there error, Mr Overall submitted, in not considering these matters in deciding whether to act under s.10, but also the failure to do so had the result that the penalty was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
      
    37 It was conceded by Mr Overall that a sentencing judge need not consider s.10 unless specifically requested to do so; and in those circumstances there is a real question whether a passing reference to s.10, such as occurred in this case, means that error is committed if a judge fails to consider all matters that should be considered in dealing in applying s.10. However, I proceed on the assumption that this should be done.  
     
      
    38 As conceded by Mr Overall, the primary judge did in the course of the judgment generally refer to the matters which he seeks to rely on in connection with s.10. In those circumstances, I would not conclude that, in considering whether it was a case for application of s.10, the primary judge did not take those matters into account, along with the question of triviality to which she specifically referred in connection with s.10. I accept Mr Overall’s submission that s.10 may be applied even if the offence is not found to be trivial, but I would not read the primary judge’s remarks as indicating that she thought otherwise.  
     
      
    39 On the question whether the sentence was manifestly excessive, the primary judge took into account the matters to which I have already referred, and took into account the circumstance that the appellant had co-operated with the Council in correcting the illegal use of the duplexes, within a reasonable time, as being to some extent relevant to contrition and remorse. However, on the question of contrition and remorse, the primary judge correctly took into account that the appellant did not plead guilty but, on the contrary, gave evidence conflicting with the evidence of the tenants which the primary judge accepted; and did not appear to accept the finding that he was guilty. In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that it was manifestly wrong not to act under s.10, or that the penalty was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    40 There appears to be no reason why costs should not follow the event. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, and appeal against sentence dismissed. 
       
      3. Appellant to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal and application.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 I would add that, in my opinion, the consequences of giving effect to a literal interpretation of s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the case of revocation of a s 12 bond are so anomalous that the following approach is preferable. Upon revocation of a s 12 bond, s 99 requires the Court to apply s 47, and subject to s 47 and any other relevant part of Pt. IV being complied with, the sentence “takes effect”. That means that, for the first time, there is an effectual imposition of a sentence; and accordingly, in that case, “the day on which the sentence is imposed” in s 47 should be taken as the day on which the sentence takes effect pursuant to s 99(1)(c)(iii). 
     
      
    3 LEVINE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Howie and the reasons therefor. 
     
      
       
      Background 
      
    4 HOWIE J: This is an appeal by the Crown under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act. On 25 November 2003 the respondent pleaded guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing a charge that on 12 August 2003 he knowingly took part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. This is an offence contrary to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years. The respondent came before Judge O’Reilly on 28 November 2003 for sentence and asked his Honour to take into account two offences on a Form 1 under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. These offences were, firstly, a charge of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, that offence having occurred between 23 July and 23 October 2001, and, secondly, a charge of being in possession of two unregistered firearms, contrary to s 36(1) of the Firearms Act, that offence occurring on 23 October 2001. 
     
      
    5 Judge O’Reilly sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 2 years and suspended that sentence upon the respondent entering into a bond for two years to be of good behaviour in accordance with s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Crown asserts that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions was lodged on 17 December 2003 and served on the respondent about a week later. 
     
      
    6 On 12 August 2003 police went to a shed on premises where the respondent lived with his parents at Llandilo in Sydney’s western suburbs. The respondent was found in the presence of five other persons and with a number of items indicative of the fact that methylamphetamine was being manufactured in those premises. The items located by police included laboratory glassware, a water-recycling system, a drum and a burner. There were 246 pseudoephedrine tablets derived from non-prescription medication such as Codryl and Telfast. 
     
      
    7 The first matter contained on the Form 1 arose on 23 October 2001 when police executed a search warrant on the same premises at Llandilo and found items involved in the manufacture of methylamphetamine and approximately 77 grams of the successfully produced drug. The respondent was arrested. Over 12 months later, on 6 November 2002, he was arraigned in the Penrith District Court for the first offence set out on the Form 1 and pleaded not guilty. The matter was set down for trial on 3 March 2003 but the hearing date was later vacated. The trial was ultimately listed on 24 November 2003 but on that date the respondent indicated that he was prepared to plead guilty to the 2003 offence, which at that time was before the Local Court. He also indicated a preparedness to have the October 2001 matter taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    8 The second offence on the Form 1 arose from the search of the premises on 23 October 2001 and related to the finding by police of two rifles in a locked metal safe at the back of a shed. 
     
      
    9 In respect of both the matter on the indictment and the first matter on the Form 1, the Crown’s allegation was that the respondent was knowingly taking part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine in that he permitted the premises to be used for that purpose. 
     
      
    10 The respondent was arrested for the offence on the indictment on 12 August 2003 and remained in custody until he was sentenced by Judge O’Reilly on 28 November 2003. 
     
      
    11 The respondent was born on 13 September 1967 and was thus aged 36 years when he was sentenced. He had three children living with him; one aged 8 years from a former marriage, and two younger children one born while he was in custody. He had a criminal record for what were relatively minor matters dealt with in the Local Court. In October 1994 he was fined $400 for possession of a prohibited drug. In December 2002 he was fined $500 on a charge of goods in custody. In August 2003 he was before the Local Court on various driving matters for which he was fined and disqualified from driving. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing proceedings 
      
    12 The respondent gave evidence before Judge O’Reilly. He said that he had been living at home on the property of his parents since leaving school in 1984. The property contained a house and a number of sheds. He had worked in various forms of manual employment until he bought a bobcat and tipper in 1992. He then conducted a business as an excavator until he was forced to sell the equipment in 2000 because of difficulties securing work and looking after his son. 
     
      
    13 He explained his involvement in the offences of October 2001 in this way. He met a man named Thorning in 1994 while he was doing contract work. At some stage Thorning told the respondent that he was forced to leave his place of abode and to take up residence in a caravan. The respondent, with his parent’s consent, allowed Thorning to stay on his parent’s property. While Thorning was living there, the respondent became suspicious that he and the respondent’s then girl friend were involved in making amphetamine on the property. Thorning denied the allegation when the respondent put it to him. During his evidence the respondent was asked why he did not report the matter to police, and he answered: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I was not a hundred per cent sure and I was – like Brad was a good friend and Jade was my girlfriend at the time and you know just trying to help her in the best way as I could but in hindsight I know now I definitely should’ve went to the police or had something done about it for sure. 
        
       
      
    14 The respondent was asked about his involvement in the offence in August 2003 and he said, 
     
      
       
        
         
        I just said I’m deeply regretful for letting – allowing it to happen again. At the time I was in a position where I was – threats were made against me and I didn’t really want to find out if they were going to be carried out and in hindsight I know now that I should’ve rang the police, shouldn’t have allowed it to happen. I don’t know why I allowed it to happen. It was a silly thing to do. 
        
       
       
      He said that the threats were of “bodily harm type thing and towards my family”. 
       
      
    15 The respondent was asked about the effect of being in custody and he said, 
     
      
       
        
         
        It’s made me realise that what I did was totally wrong and I’d never do that again and it just wasn’t worth it. There’s too much to be said that – the beauty of freedom and to be able to live your life normally and to be with your son, maintain a normal life, not to be locked up every day at 3 o’clock in the afternoon and not be able to see your son. Not to, you know, be there if he needs you, that sort of thing. 
        
       
      
    16 He gave an account of his possession of the two firearms. He said that his father had an interest in sport shooting and he owned pistols and rifles that were kept in a safe inside the family home. The respondent received one of the rifles to which the charge related from a friend during an amnesty period. The weapon was unable to be fired because the barrel was “no good at all”. The other rifle, a .22, he had for about 6 months before his arrest. He had intended to do it up and then give it to his father to have registered in his name. However, he later changed his mind and never got round to handing in the weapon. 
     
      
    17 The respondent’s father, a lecturer at the Catholic University North Sydney, gave evidence. He was a member of a pistol-shooting club and experienced with firearms. He said that one of the weapons found in the respondent’s possession would have mal-functioned, but that the .22 “didn’t seem to be too bad”. He confirmed that the respondent had a position on offer to him when he was released from custody. 
     
      
    18 At the end of the addresses there was an exchange between the sentencing judge and the prosecutor in which the sentencing judge sought assistance as to whether he would fall into error if, in order to “give some effect to the parity argument”, he dealt with the matter by a two year suspended sentence. The prosecutor was uncertain and wished to seek some guidance during the lunch break. After the adjournment the prosecutor further addressed, and it is clear that he did not accept that a suspended sentence was within the sentencing judge’s discretion. 
     
      
    19 His Honour is recorded as saying to defence counsel: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Well I think the real issue is whether it should be two years s 12 or two years full time with a non-parole period of one year. I think that’s the decision I’ve got to make. Most of the sentencing is in the three to four year range. 
        
       
       
      The reference to “two years s 12” was clearly a reference to an order suspending a sentence of two years. 
       
      
    20 The reference to the “parity argument” was a reference to the sentencing of Thorning by another District Court Judge for the matter on the Form 1. His Honour in his remarks on sentence referred to this issue as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Now Bradley Jones Thorning was sentenced by Judge Sorby in respect of the October 2001 matter. Judge Sorby gave him a s 9 bond and I have got to have some regard to the principles of parity. Would the prisoner suffer from a legitimate [sense] of grievance if he received punishment of a higher degree? Well I suppose there is one point of difference immediately apparent and that is that Thorning had only the October 2001 matter to worry about whereas this prisoner has both, the 2001 matter and the August 2003 matter. Another difficulty about it is that Judge Sorby – first of all there was the slip of the tongue as to the legislation, he called it s 24(1) of the Crimes Act but that is plainly a simple error. But then he said it carried a maximum penalty of five years, it carries a maximum of 15 years. Indeed a maximum of five years if one looks at the ordinary sections of the Crimes Act; five years is almost an invitation to a bond. I am thinking of things such as common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
         
         
        The other thing about it is that Thorning before Judge Sorby had a record which included s 558 bonds for six matters during 1999 so they were still in force and they included significant items such as possess unauthorised firearm/pistol together with possess prohibited drug (2 counts). 
        
       
      
    21 Judge O’Reilly sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 2 years but suspended execution of the sentence on condition that the respondent enter into a bond, the conditions of which included that he place himself under the supervision of the probation and parole service. The prosecutor asked his Honour whether he had indicated that the term of the sentence was to begin on 12 August 2003, the date the respondent went into custody. His Honour replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        No we don’t do that unless and until there is a breach and we apportion the non parole periods and that sort of thing. If it comes to the worst he would certainly get credit for the time already served. 
        
       
       
      With respect, that was not an entirely correct statement of the law. 
       
       
      Suspended sentences 
      
    22 A suspended sentence has often been described as a “sword of Damocles” hanging by a thread over the head of the offender while the period of the bond is current. However, in R v Brady (1998) ABCA 7 (Alberta Court of Appeal) Fraser CJ and Cote J said at [46] 
     
      
       
        
         
        This metaphor exaggerates the severity of a conditional sentence. Even if a conditional sentence could be equated to a sword, it does not hang by a thread, but by a rope, and the only way that this rope can break is if the offender himself cuts it. And with each passing day of the sentence, the 'sword' shrinks until it finally becomes a butter knife. 
        
       
      
    23 Section 12, as it applied to the respondent’s proceedings, was as follows. 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) A court that imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender (being a sentence for a term of not more than 2 years) may make an order:  
         
          
          (a) suspending execution of the whole of the sentence for such period (not exceeding the term of the sentence) as the court may specify in the order, and 
           
          (b) directing that the offender be released from custody on condition that the offender enters into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding the term of the sentence. 
          
         
        (2) An order under this section may not be made in relation to a sentence of imprisonment if the offender is subject to some other sentence of imprisonment that is not the subject of such an order. 
         
        (3) Subject to section 99 (1), Part 4 does not apply to a sentence of imprisonment the subject of an order under this section except to the extent to which it deals with setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence. 
         
        (4) An order under this section may be made after a court has decided not to make a home detention order in relation to the sentence of imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    24 Section 12(3) states, in effect, that Part 4 of the Act does not apply to a sentence that is being suspended, “except to the extent to which it deals with setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence”. Therefore, s 44, (court to set non-parole period), s 45 (court may decline to fix a non-parole period), s 46 (court not to set non-parole period for sentence of 6 months), and s 49 (restriction on term of sentence) do apply. They are all found in Part 4 of the Act and are all concerned with “setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence”. For offences committed after April 2003, Division 1A of Part 4 (standard non-parole periods) also applies if relevant. 
     
      
    25 To the extent that Judge O’Reilly believed that the non-parole period was determined upon revocation of the bond, he was, with respect, not correct. The sentence imposed by him was erroneous to the extent that his Honour failed either to specify the non-parole period or to give reasons for declining to do so. Of course that error does not mean that the Crown appeal should succeed. The failure to sentence in accordance with those provisions of Part 4 that did apply did not invalidate the sentence; ss 44(4) and 45(4). The sentencing proceedings could be re-opened under s 43 of the Act, because the sentence imposed is “a penalty that is contrary to law”. See R v Finnie (No 2) [2004] NSWCCA 150. 
     
      
    26 The provisions of the Act that do not apply at the stage when a sentence is being suspended include s 47 (commencement of sentence), s 48 (information about release date), and s 50 (making of parole orders by court). They are all found in Part 4 but they do not concern “the setting of the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence”. The fact that s 47 does not apply is fundamental because it means that the court, which is suspending a sentence, does not nominate the commencement date of the sentence (because s 47(2) does not apply) nor does the sentence automatically commence on the date that it was imposed (because s 47(1) has no effect). 
     
      
    27 Insofar as Judge O’Reilly was of the view that, if “the worst” happened and the bond was revoked, the period served in custody could be taken into account at that time, his Honour was, with respect, appears to be correct. The consequences of the revocation of a good behaviour bond are set out in s 99 of the Sentencing Act. The section provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) If a court revokes a good behaviour bond:  
         
          
          (a) in the case of a bond referred to in section 9, it may re-sentence the offender for the offence to which the bond relates, or 
           
          (b) in the case of a bond referred to in section 10, it may convict and sentence the offender for the offence to which the bond relates, or 
           
           (c) in the case of a bond referred to in section 12:  
           
            
            (i) the order under section 12 (1)(a) ceases to have effect in relation to the sentence of imprisonment suspended by the order, and 
             
            (ii) Part 4 applies to the sentence, except to the extent to which it has already applied in relation to setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence, and 
             
            (iii) subject to the requirements of Part 4 having been complied with, the sentence takes effect. 
            
           
          
         
         
        (2) Subject to Parts 5 and 6, a court may, on revoking a good behaviour bond referred to in section 12, make an order directing that the sentence of imprisonment to which the bond relates (disregarding any part that has already been served) is to be served by way of periodic detention or home detention. 
         
         
        (3) An order made under subsection (2) is taken to be a periodic detention order made under section 6 or a home detention order made under section 7, as the case requires. 
         
         
        (4) This Act applies to the sentencing or re-sentencing of an offender under this section in the same way as it applies to the sentencing of an offender on a conviction. 
         
         
        (5) An offender who under this section is sentenced by a court for an offence has the same rights of appeal as the offender would have had if the offender had been sentenced by that court on being convicted of the offence. 
         
        
       
      
    28 The consequences of the revocation of the bond, so far as the respondent was concerned, would be: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) the order suspending the sentence would cease to have effect so that execution of the sentence would be revived; 
         
         
        (b) those provisions in Part 4 of the Act generally concerned with the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment, but not setting the term of the sentence or the non-parole period, would be applied; 
         
         
        (c) the sentence would take effect; 
         
         
        (d) if appropriate, the court could order that the sentence (disregarding the period already served) be served by way of periodic detention or home detention. 
        
       
      
    29 It should be noted that the offender is neither sentenced nor resentenced for the offence to which the bond relates, as would be the case where s 99(1)(a) or (1)(b) applied. Further, ss 99(4) and (5) do not apply in the case of a revocation of a bond that was entered under s 12 of the Act. In so far as the decision of this Court in R v Hunt [2002] NSWCCA 266 suggests that there can be an appeal from an order made on a revocation of a bond under s 12, or that the task following the revocation of such a bond entails resentencing the offender, it seems to me, with respect, to be not in accordance with the provisions of s 99(1)(c). 
     
      
    30 The only order that the court is authorised by s 99 to make on revocation of the bond is that the sentence, which has already been imposed, is to be served by way of periodic or home detention. The only other matters that the court has to consider are those provisions of Part 4 of the Act that may then be applicable. This is in effect the reverse of the situation that pertained when the sentence was being suspended. 
     
      
    31 Therefore, in the case of the respondent, had the “worst” occurred and the bond was revoked, s 47 of the Act applied. That section relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) A sentence of imprisonment commences:  
         
          
          (a) subject to section 70 and to any direction under subsection (2), on the day on which the sentence is imposed, or 
           
          (b) if the execution of the sentence is stayed under section 80, on the day on which the court decides whether or not to make a home detention order in relation to the sentence. 
          
         
         
        (2) A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment:  
         
          
          (a) is taken to have commenced on a day occurring before the day on which the sentence is imposed, or  
           
          (b) commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment.  
          
         
         
        (3) In deciding whether or not to make a direction under subsection (2) (a) with respect to a sentence of imprisonment, and in deciding the day on which the sentence is taken to have commenced, the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence to which the sentence relates.  
         
         
        (4)……………………  
         
         
        (5) A direction under subsection (2) (b) may not be made in relation to a sentence of imprisonment imposed on an offender who is serving some other sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention if:  
         
          
          (a) a non-parole period has been set for that other sentence, and  
           
          (b) the non-parole period for that other sentence has expired, and  
           
          (c) the offender is still in custody under that other sentence.  
          
         
         
        (6)………………….  
        
       
      
    32 It is at this stage that some considerable uncertainty arises, at least in my mind, as to how s 99 operates. Section 47(1) makes it clear that, as a general rule, a sentence commences on the date it is imposed with two stated exceptions: where an order is made that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention and where a sentence is stayed because the offender is being assessed for home detention. However, a court has power under 47(2) to make some other order as to the commencement of the sentence so that it commences either before or after the date upon which it was imposed. 
     
      
    33 When the bond under s 12 is revoked, s 47(1) applies to the sentence. If no other order were made, and on a literal application of the section, it would seem that the sentence commences on the date of its original imposition. The sentence would take effect such that it would be taken to have run during the period on which the offender was under the bond. The only part of the sentence still to be served after revocation of the bond would be the outstanding balance on the date of the revocation. In other words, the sentence would be taken to have been executed when it was imposed. 
     
      
    34 Although this would seem to be the operation of the provision according to the literal meaning of s 47(1), it leads to some curious, and seemingly unintended, consequences. For example, it would mean that s 100 could have no practical application in respect of a bond entered under s 12. Section 100 is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Action may be taken under this Part in relation to a good behaviour bond even if the term of the bond has expired, but in respect only of matters arising during the term of the bond. 
        
       
      
    35 In any case where a bond under s 12 has expired, but is revoked for a breach occurring within its term, revocation would be a meaningless exercise if, upon revocation, the suspended sentence commenced to run from the date of its imposition. Because by the operation of s 12(1)(b) the term of the bond can be no longer than the term of the sentence, and if, by the application of s 47(1), they both commence from the same date once the bond is revoked, the term must be taken to have expired when the bond did. Yet it is quite conceivable that a serious breach could occur during the period of the bond but revocation not take place before the bond expires. A simple example is where the breach is the commission of another offence but conviction for that offence does not occur until after the bond expires. 
     
      
    36 There are other consequences arising from the operation of s 47(1) on revocation that raise in my mind the question whether it could really have been intended that s 47(1) would operate according to its literal terms on revocation of a bond under s 12. Section 99(1)(c)(iii) states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        subject to the requirements of Part 4 having been complied with, the sentence takes effect. 
        
       
       
      As I have noted, those provisions of Part 4 that must be complied with include the making of a parole order for the release of the prisoner to parole. It seems to me to be absurd to require a court to go through the farce of solemnly making such an order and providing parole conditions, when, by the application of s 47(1), the court may find that the offender has in effect been on parole for a substantial period of the sentence prior to making the order releasing him and is just about to complete his parole period. 
       
      
    37 That situation should be compared with a case where, as it just so happened, the offender was serving an unrelated sentence at the time of the revocation. In such a case the court would have power, quite serendipitously, to require that the full sentence be served by postponing its commencement under s 47(2) to make it cumulative upon the sentence being served. Yet no appeal lies from that decision. 
     
      
    38 I find it difficult to accept that it was intended that the consequences of a revocation of a bond under s 12 could have such widely disparate results depending upon the particular circumstances in which the offender finds himself at the time of revocation. 
     
      
    39 These anomalies, oddities and inconsistencies would be avoided if, in the case of a revocation of a bond under s 12 “the day on which the sentence is imposed” in s 47(1) is taken to be when the sentence takes effect pursuant to s 99(1)(c)(iii). If the sentence were to commence, subject to any order under s 47(2), on the date of revocation, that seems to me to produce a more sensible reading of s 99(1)(c)(iii) and the requirement that the court apply those provisions in Part 4 that were not applicable at the time the sentence was imposed. It also gives some meaningful work for s 100 to do in cases where the bond was entered into under s 12. By applying s 47(2) and backdating the sentence the court could take into account any period spent by the offender in custody prior to the date of sentence. This approach to the effect of a revocation of a bond under s 12 seems to be consistent with the view of the provisions adopted at least by Sully J in R v Gamgee (2001) 51 NSWLR 707. 
     
      
    40 With respect, I find s 99(2) to be incomprehensible both as to its meaning and the policy behind it, regardless of what interpretation is given to s 47(1) and s 99(1)(c). This section permits a court, when revoking a bond, to order that “the sentence of imprisonment to which the bond relates (disregarding any part that has already served) to be served by way of periodic detention or home detention”. It is the words that I have underlined to which I find it almost impossible to give a sensible meaning. What is the part of a suspended sentence “that has already been served”? And why is a court being required, for reasons unconnected with the conduct of the offender, to disregard a period of a sentence that has already been served? 
     
      
    41 If s 47(1) applies, so that on revocation the sentence is taken to have commenced on the date it was imposed, then the words could be referring to that part of the sentence that has notionally already been served, being the period when the offender was subject to the bond and prior to revocation. To that extent the underlined words support the literal application of s 47(1). But if that is the case, then it appears that it was the intention of the legislator that the balance of the sentence should be served if it is to be spent in full time custody or on parole, but that the whole of the term of the suspended sentence is to be served if the court is going to make an order for periodic or home detention. I find it difficult to understand why that should be so, and it seems to me it could be unfair to order that an offender serve the whole of the sentence by periodic detention or home detention where, for example, there is but a month left to run of a two year sentence and the offender would be on parole during that period. Again it should be noted there would be no appeal from such an order and yet the consequences of a revocation of the bond can be so markedly different. 
     
      
    42 If, contrary to the literal words in s 47(1), the sentence commences on the date of revocation, then what part of the sentence has already been served? It could only sensibly be a reference to the period in respect of which the sentence has been backdated under s 47(2) because, for example, the offender was in custody before the suspended sentence was imposed. But again I have difficulty with the notion that a court should be directed not to take into account a period during which a person was serving a sentence when ordering that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention or home detention. 
     
      
    43 I am prepared to admit that, in the absence of full argument by the parties on these matters, I may be overlooking some provision or policy that makes the operation of suspended sentences rational, consistent and comprehensible. But I am also prepared to admit defeat and move on. I would simply pause to express my exasperation that it appears to be so difficult to find in the legislation the answer to what is a fundamental question and one that should be capable of an immediate and simple answer by reference to a single provision of the Act. Does the revocation of a bond under s 12 reactivate the whole of the suspended sentence so that, subject to s 47(2), it commences from the date of revocation or does it merely reactivate that part of the sentence that is the equivalent to the unexpired period of the bond? The answer to that question will reveal whether a suspended sentence in this State is a sword or a butter knife. 
     
      
    44 I will now turn to the question of whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate and, if it was, whether the Court should intervene. 
     
      
       
      The Crown’s arguments 
      
    45 Generally the Crown submission is that the term of the sentence imposed, and, in particular, because it was suspended, was inadequate to denounce the respondent’s criminal conduct and reflect both general and specific deterrence. The Crown in effect submits that his Honour had too much regard to, what he considered to be, the minor role of the respondent in permitting the premises to be used for manufacturing by others. The Crown relies upon the statement of Buddin J in R v Turkmani [2002] NSWCCA 388 recognising that even minor participants are essential for the success of an enterprise to manufacture drugs and that “appropriately salutary sentences be imposed upon them”. 
     
      
    46 The Crown complains that His Honour gave too much weight to the respondent’s supposed rehabilitation in accepting his evidence that he would not offend again, in light of the fact that only three months earlier he had committed the offence while on bail for the very same criminal conduct committed almost two years earlier. Further, it was contended that the sentencing judge was in error in taking into account that the respondent was “a man in general terms of good character” in the light of the fact that he had committed the two offences of being involved in the manufacture of drugs and the statement of Lee CJ at CL in R v Haydon (NSWCCA, unreported, 11 November 1990) as to the seriousness of manufacturing drugs even by persons of otherwise good character. 
     
      
    47 These are grounds that merely amplify the complaint that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. The resolution of these particular complaints depends upon a determination of whether the sentence was outside the legitimate range of his Honour’s discretion rather than by determining whether he gave too much weight or too little weight to some relevant fact or sentencing principle. Manifest inadequacy does not depend on the identification of error, and very often the error will simply be that the sentence is outside the legitimate sentencing range having regard to the facts and the importance of particular aspects of punishment. However, there are some specific complaints that should be addressed. 
     
      
       
      The significance of the firearms offences 
      
    48 It was submitted by the Crown that his Honour was too dismissive of the firearms offences and generally paid too little regard to the second offence on the Form 1. In respect of the charge of being in possession of unregistered firearms, Judge O’Reilly said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Perhaps I could say at this point in time that the rifles do not play a major role in this sentencing exercise at all. I am satisfied that one of them a Martini his father says it was all unusable. The barrel was badly corroded so it does (sic) not come into operation. The other was only a simple .22 rifle. And I accept what the prisoner says that he had it in mind, as it were, re-conditioning the 0.22. Alternatively, surrendering both of them under the amnesty and he simply had not got round to it. But I do not treat them as being terribly relevant. It is not part of a drug manufacturer’s regime to have a rifle. And I will take them into account in the sentence I impose. 
        
       
       
      There is in my opinion merit in the Crown’s complaint and this passage indicates that his Honour gave too little weight to the charge under s 36(1) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       and, as a result, his sentencing discretion miscarried. 
       
      
    49 I do not quite understand what his Honour meant to convey by stating that one of the weapons was “only a simple .22 rifle”. His Honour might have been seeking to distinguish the weapon from a “prohibited firearm” or “prohibited pistol” as defined in the Firearms Act, in order to emphasise that the offence charged was less serious than would have been the case if such a weapon had been involved. With respect, if that was the point his Honour was trying to make, it would have been more appropriate to indicate the different applicable maximum penalties involved rather than to make a remark which seems to suggest, at least to my mind, that his Honour thought that any offence relating to a .22 rifle was not a serious one. 
     
      
    50 Further, his Honour seems to have thought that the offence relating to the firearms was not “terribly relevant” to the sentencing exercise in that “it is not part of a drug manufacturer’s regime to have a rifle”. Again, with respect, I do not understand that remark. If it is to suggest that there is common or judicial knowledge that person’s involved in drug manufacturing do not use rifles, I doubt the validity of the statement. But in any event the offence was a serious one even if his Honour was of the view that the possession of the rifle was unrelated to the activity in which the respondent was involved at the time the weapons were located. 
     
      
    51 In R v Cromarty [2004] NSWCCA 54, Kirby J emphasised the importance of the legislative policy behind the provisions of the Firearms Act as set out in s 3 of the Act. Kirby J pointed out that the provision concerned with the registration of firearms was an important tool in the legislature’s attempt to impose strict control upon the possession of weapons within the community and a failure to register a weapon, even if the offender was entitled to be in possession of it, was not to be treated lightly. 
     
      
    52 It seems to me, with respect, that his Honour completely misunderstood the significance of the firearms offences and the weight to be attributed to them in sentencing the respondent. Although his Honour said that he was taking them into account in the sentence he was to impose, it is difficult to see how he could have done so in any meaningful way, having expressed the opinion that they were not “terribly relevant”. The fact that the respondent was going to recondition the .22 rifle but changed his mind and never got around to surrendering either of them was no excuse and little by way of mitigation. The respondent clearly knew the law in relation to the possession of firearms and simply chose to ignore it. Nor was it a mitigating factor that the respondent was not going to use the rifle for any criminal purpose. If such had been the case it would have been an aggravating feature and would probably have resulted in a more serious offence. 
     
      
    53 Mr Rasmussen, who appeared for the respondent and made very detailed and helpful submissions on his client’s behalf, relied upon the statements of Gleeson CJ in R v Thurgar (1999) 51 A Crim R 109 which emphasised the importance of the use to be made of an unlicensed firearm when determining the seriousness of the offence of being in possession of it. That observation must now be considered in the light of the very substantial legislative changes that have been made to offences concerned with firearms since 1999. Nothing said in that case should be taken as any warrant for not treating a firearms offence seriously notwithstanding that no criminal use is to be made of the weapon. The courts must seek to implement the policy of the existing legislation and that is to control the possession and use of firearms in the community by honest citizens, and not simply to disarm the criminally minded. 
     
      
    54 In my opinion this ground is made out and the sentencing exercise miscarried. 
     
      
       
       
      The “parity argument” 
      
    55 The Crown relies upon the importance given by his Honour to the “parity argument” in determining to suspend the sentence as being an error. It is contended, rightly in my opinion, that there was in truth no issue of parity that needed to be addressed by his Honour. 
     
      
    56 As I have already indicated, Judge O’Reilly was troubled by the sentence imposed on Thorning by Judge Sorby. It will be recalled that Thorning was a co-offender in relation to the first offence relating to the manufacture of methylamphetamine in October 2001 and not in the offence occurring in August 2003. It is highly significant that the respondent was being sentenced, not for the 2001 offence but the 2003 offence. The earlier offence was being taken into account on the Form 1. As was made clear in the Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, the court does not sentence the offender for a matter taken into account on a Form 1. A charge on the Form 1, however, may increase the sentence otherwise appropriate for the principal offence by the court giving greater weight to personal deterrence and retribution than it would have done in the absence of the Form 1. 
     
      
    57 Bearing these matters in mind, I have difficulty in understanding how it might be thought that the respondent could have a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of any disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and that imposed upon Thorning. The two were only in a highly technical sense co-offenders for the purpose of the application of any sentencing principle, because they were not being sentenced either for the same offence or even the same act of criminality. I do not comprehend how the respondent could conceivably have a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the sentence imposed upon Thorning without knowing the amount by which the sentence imposed by Judge O’Reilly for the 2003 offence was increased having regard only to the fact that the 2001 offence was taken into account on the Form 1. Indeed, as the Chief Justice indicated in the Attorney General’s Application (No 1 of 2002) at [44]; 
     
      
       
        
         
        44. The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principal offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it will rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence of taking into account Form 1 offences…….. 
        
       
      
    58 Another matter that Judge O’Reilly thought had some significance was the supposed slip made by Judge Sorby in sentencing Thorning as if the offence were one under the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for which was imprisonment for 5 years. Having regard to the fact that his Honour was delivering an ex tempore judgment and seeking to make a point in favour of the respondent, the observation that an “ordinary offence” falling within that category “is almost an invitation to a bond” can be disregarded. It is so unsound as a statement of sentencing policy that His Honour could not have meant that he should be taken literally. 
     
      
    59 The fact that Judge Sorby may have been under a misapprehension as to the nature of the offence or the appropriate maximum sentence when dealing with Thorning was in my view irrelevant to the sentencing of the respondent even if parity was an issue. The principle of parity is not concerned with overcoming any perceived injustice held by an offender as to his treatment when compared with that of a co-offender. For example, there would be no issue of parity arising if Thorning had never been charged or had been acquitted. In my view the issue of parity does not arise simply because of some error made by another sentencing court when sentencing a co-offender. I do not believe that the decision of this Court in R v Hodges (NSWCCA, unreported, 20 August 1997), a decision that in my view should be restricted to its own very peculiar facts, suggests otherwise. 
     
      
    60 In any event, it is obvious from the sentencing remarks of Judge Sorby that Thorning was being sentenced as an accessory after the fact to the commission of the offence by the respondent. The allegation was that Thorning was assisting the respondent to avoid detection by storing items connected with his, that is the respondent’s, involvement in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Thorning was thus being sentenced in accordance with s 350 of the Crimes Act, which prescribed the maximum penalty for his offence as being imprisonment for five years. All of this is clear from Judge Sorby’s sentencing remarks and there was no error in his approach to the sentencing of Thorning. An issue of parity does not arise where co-offenders are sentenced for different offences and on different factual bases. 
     
      
    61 It is clear that Judge O’Reilly decided to suspend the sentence on the basis of a parity issue that simply had no foundation either in fact or law. His Honour said in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Before I gave full consideration to the parity point it seemed to me that an appropriate result here would be a full-time custody [sentence] with a non-parole period of one year backdated to 12 August 2003 and a full term of two years. But then having thought about the parity side of it, it seemed to me that he may well have been entitled to some legitimate sense of grievance if, having already served three and a half months full-time custody he is doomed to continue that for another eight or nine months or so. 
        
       
      
    62 In my view the Crown has made good its challenge and the sentencing discretion completely miscarried. Subject to the question of the exercise of  
     
      
      the court’s discretion whether to intervene, the appeal should be allowed. 
       
       
      Should the Court intervene? 
      
    63 In the event that the Court found error and was called upon to exercise its discretion, an affidavit was received from the respondent’s father. It states that the respondent is in full-time employment. When not working, the respondent spends his spare time with his son. It seems that he is no longer in the relationship that was current at the time of sentencing and nothing is said of the other two children. The respondent has apparently been attending on the Probation and Parole Service and carried out its requirements. His father believes that the respondent has received a “salutary insight into his self-destructive lifestyle that he began leading which he now appears to have left behind him”. He also believes that his son is contrite and that his experience so far with the Probation and Parole Service has “demonstratively rehabilitated him”. 
     
      
    64 The offence for which the respondent was to be sentenced was a serious one in its own right but severely aggravated by the fact that it was committed on bail while he was awaiting trial for another similar offence. His explanations or excuses for his conduct are to my mind unconvincing and inconsistent with true remorse and contrition. In respect of the first matter on the Form 1 his explanation is incompatible with his acceptance of guilt and is incredible. His account of the second matter is that there were some vague threats made by persons involved, an explanation given for the first time in evidence before his Honour. Although the Crown accepted that his participation was in permitting the premises to be used for the manufacture, that is not a matter which itself suggests that his criminality was minimal. 
     
      
    65 It was submitted that these were offences that could have been dealt with in the Local Court. That contention seems to me to be at odds with the provisions of Table 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act, as a magistrate could not have been satisfied that the offence involved less than an indictable quantity of the drug. But in any event the fact that the offence was committed on bail made it appropriate that it be dealt with in the District Court. 
     
      
    66 Unfortunately the respondent received such undue leniency that he was permitted to be at large, albeit conditionally, after having served only 3½ months in custody for a serious offence committed while on bail for a like offence and having two serious matters taken into account on a Form 1. On its face the outcome is so inadequate that it must be redressed even at the cost of returning the respondent to custody. It is distasteful in the extreme for any court to return a person to custody where that person justifiably believed that he had served the custodial part of his sentence subject to him being of good behaviour. But there is a public expectation that persons who commit serious offences such as the offender did and while on conditional liberty should be appropriately punished. That expectation was not fulfilled in the present case because of a serious miscarriage of a court’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    67 In some cases the object of a Crown appeal will be attained by a recognition by this Court of the sentencing error and a restatement of the principles that should have been applied. In such a case it may be unnecessary to increase the punishment inflicted upon the particular respondent in order to redress the error of the sentencing court, particularly where the respondent has been released or is about to be released into the community. This, in my view, is not such a case. 
     
      
    68 In my opinion, having regard to all the mitigating and aggravating factors set out in s 21A of the Act, the least sentence that can now be imposed upon the respondent is that chosen by the sentencing judge before he took into account the “parity argument”: a sentence with a total term of imprisonment for 2 years and a non-parole period of 1 year. That sentence is itself verging on the inadequate given the total criminality before the sentencing judge, and, in particular, having regard to the non-parole period fixed. However, in recognition of the fact that the respondent has been at liberty in the community under the suspended sentence and subject to the bond, I would not vary the non-parole period and I would date the sentence from when he was originally taken into custody for the offence. 
     
      
    69 There are special circumstances in that the respondent is being returned to custody having been under supervision since release in November and because of double jeopardy. The non-parole period has been reduced because any longer period in custody might jeopardise the rehabilitation that has taken place during the period he has been at large. 
     
      
    70 I propose that the appeal be allowed and the sentence imposed by Judge O’Reilly quashed. The respondent should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of one year to date from 13 August 2003 and expiring on 12 August 2004 the date upon which he is to be released to parole. The conditions of his parole order are to include a condition that he places himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. The balance of the term is to be one year to date from 13 August 2004 and to expire on 12 August 2005. The respondent should be returned to custody forthwith.

      GREG JAMES, J. 
       
       
       
      FRIDAY 28 MAY 2004 
       
       
       
      No. 70056 of 1999  
       
       
       
      REGINA v. HARRY ROBINSON 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Harry Robinson, was found guilty by the verdict of a jury on 12 March, of the offence that he had on 17 September 1998 at Junee in the State of New South Wales murdered John Thomas Kennett. That verdict was reached at a trial, which had commenced on 23 February 2004. 
     
      
    2 The offender had previously undergone a trial in April 2000 before Justice Barr and a jury and had similarly been convicted at that trial of this crime but had successful appealed. It is common ground between the Crown and the offender's legal representatives that all relevant circumstances, except for one to which I will return, were adverted to by Justice Barr when he sentenced the offender on Friday 16 June 2000 to a term of imprisonment of 22 years commencing on 12 December 1999 and expiring on 11 December 2021. His Honour at that time imposed a non-parole period of 15 years, providing for the offender to become eligible to be released on parole no earlier than and on 11 December 2014. 
     
      
    3 It is also common ground between the parties that the sentencing regime has, to some extent changed. At the time at which Justice Barr sentenced the offender, s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provided as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. In determining the sentence to be imposed on an offender, a court must impose a sentence of a severity that is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. 
        
       
       
        
        2. For that purpose, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) the nature and circumstances of the case, 
        
       
       
        
         (b) if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a serious of criminal acts – that course of conduct, 
        
       
       
        
         (c) the person circumstances of any victim of the offence, including:- 
        
       
       
        
         (i) the age of the victim (particularly if the victim is very old or very young), and 
        
       
       
        
         (ii) any physical or mental disability of the victim, and 
        
       
       
        
         (iii) any vulnerability of the victim arising because of the nature of the victim’s occupation, 
        
       
       
        
         (d) any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence, 
        
       
       
        
         (e) the degree to which the offender has shown contrition for the offence:- 
        
       
       
        
         (i) by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence, or 
        
       
       
        
         (ii) in any other manner, 
        
       
       
        
         (f) the need to deter the offender or other persons from committing an offence of the same or a similar character, 
        
       
       
        
         (g) the need to protect the community from the offender, 
         
         
         (h) the need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
         
         
         (i) the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender, 
         
         
         (j) the prospect of rehabilitation of the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In addition, in determining whether a sentence under Division 2 or 3 of Part 2 is appropriate, the court must have regard to the nature and severity of the conditions that may be imposed on, or may apply to, the offender under that sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The matters to be taken into account by a court under this section are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under this Act or any other law. 
        
       
       
        
        5. This section does not apply to the determination of a sentence if proceedings (other than committal proceedings) for the offence were commenced in a court before the commencement of this section.” 
        
       
      
    4 Section 21A now provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. General 
         
         
          
          In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) that are relevant and known to the court, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. Aggravating factors 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the victim was a police officer, emergency services worker, correctional officer, judicial officer, health worker, teacher, community worker, or other public official, exercising public or community functions and the offence arose because of the victim’s occupation, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the offender has a record of previous convictions, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) the offence was committed in company, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (f) the offence involved gratuitous cruelty, 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial, 
          
         
         
          
          (h) the offence was motivated by hatred for or prejudice against a group of people to which the offender believed the victim belonged (such as people of a particular religion, racial or ethnic origin, language, sexual orientation or age, or having a particular disability), 
          
         
         
          
          (i) the offence was committed without regard for public safety, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (j) the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence or alleged offence, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (k) the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (l) the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bank teller or service station attendant), 
          
         
         
          
          (m) the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts, 
          
         
         
          
          (n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
          
         
         
          
          The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
          
         
         
        3. Mitigating factors 
         
         
          
          The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, 
          
         
         
        (c) the offender was provoked by the victim, 
         
         
        (d) the offender was acting under duress, 
         
         
          
          (e) the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions, 
          
         
         
        (f) the offender was a person of good character, 
         
         
        (g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend, 
         
         
          
          (h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender’s age or otherwise, 
          
         
         
          
          (i) the offender has shown remorse for the offence by making reparation for any injury, loss or damage or in any other manner, 
          
         
         
          
          (j) the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender’s age or any disability, 
          
         
         
          
          (k) a plea of guilty by the offender (as provided by s.22), 
          
         
         
          
          (l) the degree of pre-trial disclosure by the defence (as provided by s.22A), 
          
         
         
          
          (m) assistance by the offender to law enforcement authorities (as provided by s.23). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        4. The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so. 
         
         
        5. The fact that any such aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence.” 
        
       
      
    5 That new s.21A commenced on 1 February 2003 and is presently in force. That section provides that in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account aggravating matters referred to in subsection (2) mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) and any other objective or subjective factor affecting the relative seriousness of the offence. The section does not exclude the court taking into account any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account. 
     
      
    6 I have had regard to each of the aggravating factors and mitigating factors as are provided in s.21A(2) and (3). 
     
      
    7 In particular, however, I have had regard to the matters to which Justice Barr referred and which are referred to in the mass of exhibited material provided to me, which had also been provided to Justice Barr, and which is marked Exhibit A on sentence. That material includes the offender's prior record, both in custody and out of custody and psychiatric reports referring to the offender's mental state for many years. I have also had regard to Exhibit B which refers to the offender's conduct whilst in gaol. 
     
      
    8 Justice Barr when sentencing the offender published an extensive judgment to which conveniently I might now refer for the circumstances of the offence. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""In September 1998, the deceased, who had been convicted of sexual offences involving school children, was placed in the same pod in custody in the Junee Correctional Centre as were housed, the offender and a number of other persons. The fact of that conviction appears to have been suspected by other persons including the offender in the pod. Papers were obtained from the deceased's cell confirming the suspicion, and a discussion took place amongst a number of the prisoners as to giving the deceased a hiding with a view to getting rid of him from that part of the correctional complex. The offender volunteered to thump the deceased. He and another prisoner were seen to go to the deceased's cell and attack him violently.” 
        
       
      
    9 Justice Barr concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender was concentrating on the deceased's head and the other inmate on the lower part of the body. The offender was wearing joggers and delivered a large number of kicks to the head.” 
        
       
      
    10 The evidence before me is to the same effect as was the evidence before Justice Barr. I too am persuaded that the offender attacked the head and upper portion of the deceased. The cause of death was blunt force head injury, the damage to the deceased's head was referred to by Justice Barr in detail. It was appalling. These injuries were inflicted either wholly by the offender or at least substantially by him. He was, however at the time carrying an injury to his knee and wore an elastic bandage to support it. I do not see, despite his complaint to this effect, that he was so impeded in what he did. 
     
      
    11 He was born in Australia on 2nd May 1972 of Lebanese parents. He is the third eldest of nine children. His family has been described as dysfunctional. He was, himself, the subject of physical and sexual abuse at the instance of his father. He became violent at an early age. He began drinking alcohol and resorted to illegal drugs in his early teens. In September 1991, as Justice Barr relates, he was convicted of several robbery offences and sentenced to imprisonment. Thereafter he has an appalling history of criminality and confinement. 
     
      
    12 That history is also characterised by behaviour on his part that attracted observations, if not diagnosis, that he was suffering from schizophrenia. His history within gaol indicates that for a very long period of time he has misconducted himself aggressively and violently and particularly when under the influence of illicit drugs. He participated in programmes, which at least up until the time Justice Barr sentenced him, did not appear to have assisted his behaviour or assisted him to refrain from illicit drugs, notwithstanding that he had received intensive psychological counselling and assistance. 
     
      
    13 He has attempted suicide and mutilated himself on a number of occasions. He has been confined for treatment purposes, and because of the risk of self-harm, in custody more onerous than otherwise would have been the case. 
     
      
    14 He is a person who is described as deeply disturbed and as Justice Barr had noted, was referred to by Professor Finlay-Jones, psychiatrist “as one of the worst cases of borderline personality disorder"" the Professor had encountered. He has spent all but a few months of his adult life in prison. The violence and sexual assault perpetrated on him has left him severely and emotionally disturbed, such that it lead him to make violent attacks on others, particularly those who he thought might have a sexual predisposition to other than orthodox relations. 
     
      
    15 His history in gaol clearly evidences that he was a person who was unable to control himself and refrain from attacking those he thought might have had some paedophilic tendency. Those attitudes on his part were euphemistically described as “association difficulties” and because of them he was unable to progress in the classification system. The psychiatric reports from Dr. Nielssen and Dr. Clarke also diagnose “severe personality disorder”. 
     
      
    16 I also do not accept, as Justice Barr did not accept, the vague references to schizophrenia or transitory psychotic states. I accept, as Justice Barr also accepted, that up to the time of the commission of this offence and indeed for sometime afterwards, the offender suffered from sudden episodes of anger in which he acted violently and which he found difficult to control. That, I agree with Justice Barr, resulted in his developing the attitude, not only to persons other than of an orthodox sexuality, but in particular to persons thought to be homosexual, of hatred, producing real danger for those who he might come in contact with whom he believed to be homosexual. 
     
      
    17 Specifically I find that it was that attitude of mind which gave rise to the commission of this offence, an offence in which an entirely vulnerable man had been placed in circumstances, which, I am fully satisfied on the evidence tendered before me in this trial, left him completely at risk and without adequate security and liable to be attacked as he was. 
     
      
    18 All of that said, Justice Barr expressed the hope that the offender might be able to modify his behaviour and referred to a psychological report which gave some indications favourable to the offender. In particular, Justice Barr adverted to the offender, himself, objecting to his transfer to Junee, in that he might have great difficulty in dealing with persons “incarcerated for sexual assaults on children”. 
     
      
    19 It is a matter of great wonderment, bearing in mind the offender’s history, bearing in mind that objection and bearing in mind the evidence in this trial of a lack of security, in the pod, that both he and the deceased should find themselves in a pod with so little security as was provided on this occasion. 
     
      
    20 The offender has not given evidence before me. He did not give evidence before Justice Barr, but there has been admitted a report which I directed at the instigation of counsel for the offender, dated 26 April 2004 from Mr. Metcalf to the Governor of the Goulburn Correctional Complex. 
     
      
    21 Mr. Metcalf refers to his having known the inmate for a greater period of time than just that dating back to April of 2000. He refers in 2000 to the inmate not being actively involved in the case management process and having been the subject of internal disciplinary action for fighting. There were notations indicating abusive behaviour. Little had been recorded further of his behaviour up until 30 April 2001, but then it was recorded that he was apparently complying with unit routine, although there had been supplementary action for abusive behaviour and a for charge of fighting. This had apparently been out of accord with the offender’s conduct, as earlier recorded at the gaol, as being more intensively violent than for any other period. 
     
      
    22 On 1 May he was assaulted in the showers by an unknown assailant and locked up for his own protection. At that time he was a normal protection inmate. He went on strict protection and through to the end of the year continued to get “below average” notations. However, at this point in time, unlike earlier, he was willing to make contact with welfare. Through the year 2002 his behaviour was apparently suitable whilst at work, and improved. After initial problems in the year, his attitude and behaviour in the unit, as well as at work was noted as “satisfactory”. He still however failed to participate in the case management process. 
     
      
    23 There was a minor breach later in the year. Officer Metcalf records, however, the following for the year 2003:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""During 2003 inmate Robinson has improved his interactive skills between staff and himself and with other inmates. In particular his ability to co-exist and to communicate with inmates of minor paedophilia crimes was obvious during this period. He commenced to concentrate on his own time in gaol and where in the past was impatient to inmates convicted of paedophile related crimes as the yard delegate pro-actively delegated sought to ensure that other inmates in the yard did not take out their own justice on inmates who had committed such crimes. This is to this day, this is a definite noticeable change in the inmates behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    24 He being yard delegate performed the yard duty creditably, there was no disciplinary action required of him in 2003 and his interactive approach apparently prevented the occurrence of serious incidents through his direct intervention. Officer Metcalf says:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Overall a real turnaround on previous behaviour occurred during 2003.” 
        
       
      
    25 The conclusion expressed by officer Metcalf is that there is no comparison between his behaviour now with what his behaviour had been. His ability to reason and to take direction has improved. Apparently he no longer tolerates illegal drug use and seeks to prevent it. The officer says that his behaviour bearing little resemblance to that of his behaviour in the past. 
     
      
    26 It seems as if Justice Barr's hopes have had for his rehabilitation have received some further support so far as is shown by the offender’s conduct during the past 18 months. 
     
      
    27 Justice Barr records reference to submissions made to him (but not to me) that some encouragement or inciting lay at the bottom of the assault on the deceased. Justice Barr did not accept that such a thing, even if it had occurred, in any way mitigated, to any significant degree, the offender's culpability. I share that view. 
     
      
    28 I was concerned, however, not only because in my view, this was a most serious offences, though with Justice Barr I agree not one that fell in the worst category of murders, at Justice Barr's remarks which appeared to be borne out by the material before him at that time that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender had an apparent inability to stop himself going and attacking (persons) who had given him no personal offence.” 
        
       
      
    29 Justice Barr was of the view and I share that view that the offence calls “for a strongly deterrent sentence”, that no contrition or remorse has been expressed by the offender. 
     
      
    30 It is common ground that the sentence should date from the date fixed by Justice Barr as providing for the commencement date of the additional term of the sentence the offender has served when he murdered the deceased. I agree, and for myself find special circumstances. 
     
      
    31 Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it stood at the time at which Justice Barr passed his sentence provided for the fixing of the term of imprisonment and thereafter the fixing of a non-parole period and that the prima facie relationship absent special circumstances of the head sentence and non-parole period should be as referred to in s.44(2). 
     
      
    32 That section has now been replaced by a new s.44, which requires the court to first set a non-parole period for the sentence and thereafter to turn to the head sentence, but which retains the same proportionality as the former section provided again by virtue of s.44(2). 
     
      
    33 It has been submitted to me, both by counsel for the offender and also the Crown that the end result would not make a material difference to the relevant sentence, particularly in the light of the submissions that have been put to me by both counsel, that except for the matter raised in Mr. Metcalf's report to which I have referred, the considerations on sentence, I would find to be, the same as Justice Barr found them to be. 
     
      
    34 In his written submissions on sentence, Mr. Paish has drawn my attention to the views of Street C.J. in The Queen v. Gilmore (1979-1980) 1 ACR 416 at 419 where the Chief Justice referred to the sound principle of sentencing; that on a new trial following the quashing of a conviction in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the offender should not ordinarily receive a longer sentence or non-parole period than had originally been imposed. 
     
      
    35 Subsequently in Regina v. Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711 at 714 his Honour clarified that the principle was a rule of policy which indicated a prima facie approach. 
     
      
    36 Mr. Paish, counsel for the offender, submitted that I should take an approach, recognising that my discretion was independent and unfettered, but that for the sake of consistency absent any change in circumstances, of following the course taken by Justice Barr. He drew my attention to a number of matters; that there was little premeditation, no planning, the attack was of short duration and that he submitted, the intent was no more than, although it was at least as much as, an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. He submitted that the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics supported Justice Barr's sentence and, that the events of the four years that had elapsed since the passing of that sentence indicated real hope for the applicant's future. That hope, of course, is now to some extent confirmed in Mr. Metcalf's report. 
     
      
    37 In the Crown's written submissions it drew attention to five particular aggravating features referred to in s.21A. The involvement of violence, the prior record, the commission of the offence in company, that it was motivated by hate or prejudice and the vulnerability of the victim. In particular the Crown referred to the physical vulnerability of the victim as being a much smaller man than the offender. 
     
      
    38 The Crown referred to a statutory mitigating factor, or a factor which, by statute, is characterised as mitigated, that is to say, that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. I would have thought, for myself, that had the offence been part of a planned or organised criminal activity, that would be an aggravation of the offence rather than the absence of organised or planned criminal activity mitigating the offence. But in this case there is no suggestion that it was a planned or organised criminal activity, except to the extent there was the prior discussion and then the volunteering by the offender to “thump” the deceased. 
     
      
    39 The Crown submitted there is no evidence of any relevant circumstances which would require a lesser sentence and that in the absence of evidence warranting a lesser sentence or lesser non-parole period, no lesser sentence or lesser non-parole period would be imposed. That, again, is on the basis of consistency. 
     
      
    40 One of the principles underlying sentences is that there should not be an inconsistency of sentences, whether between co-offenders or between sentences passed for the same crime by different judges. As Sir Anthony Mason said in Lowe v. The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606, such an inconsistency bears the “badge of unfairness”, but where there is a matter which sufficiently distinguishes one offender from another, or where the circumstances in which a sentence comes to be passed sufficiently differs from such circumstances as they were at the time at which another sentence was passed, the distinction is one which requires that effect be given to it. 
     
      
    41 Having regard to the principles to which I referred when passing sentence in Regina v. Harrison & Georgiou (unreported, 19 December 2003) following a retrial after a successful appeal, I was minded to pass myself, particularly with reference to the principle of consistency, the same sentences as had been passed by Justice Barr with the same non-parole period. 
     
      
    42 Having regard however to the report provided by Mr. Metcalf and having regard particularly to the fact that a non-parole period is the minimum period an offender must serve for the crime, the full term being the period the offender is liable to serve for the crime unless released beforehand, and having particular regard to what officer Metcalf has said concerning the prospects of reform, I have determined that, although the head sentence should be the same, the non-parole period should be 12 months shorter than the period that had been provided in the sentence by Justice Barr. 
     
      
    43 Would you rise please, Mr Robinson. 
     
      
    44 Harry Robinson you are sentenced for the crime of the murder of John Thomas Kennett to imprisonment for a term of 22 years commencing on 12 December 1999 and expiring on 11 December 2021. I set a non-parole period of 14 years, having found special circumstances, not only those found by Justice Barr but also those referred to in the report of Mr. Metcalf. You will become eligible to be released on parole on 11 December 2013.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE  
       
      
    1 Howie J: I am about to sentence the offender for the offence of murder. The Crown alleges that she was one of three persons who were involved in the enterprise that resulted in the death of the deceased. At the present time her two alleged co-offenders are pleading not guilty to murder and are shortly to stand trial for that offence in the Supreme Court in Newcastle. The publication of the facts of this matter and, in particular, anything which might identify the alleged co-offenders either by name or by a recitation of the peculiar facts of this matter would place at real risk the fair trial of the two co-accused. 
     
      
    2 No doubt the particular interest in this matter would be in the Newcastle area from which the prospective jurors would be empanelled. The facts upon which the applicant is to be sentenced implicates the two co-accused as being involved in the murder. It is asserted by the Crown that one of them was in fact the person who was directly responsible for the death of the deceased. The other was, on the Crown’s facts, the person who recruited the offender to find a person who would carry out the killing. 
     
      
    3 It seems to me that, if the facts of this matter were recited together with the fact that the offender had pleaded guilty to the charge of murder, the publication of such material would very likely lead any reader of the report to assume that those facts were accepted by the offender and were, therefore, true. Those facts are, however, in dispute and it will be for the jury to determine whether either of the co-accused is implicated in the murder. As I understand it, the Crown does not presently intend to call the offender to give evidence on its behalf. The jury will, therefore, know nothing of the offender’s involvement other than arises from admissible evidence against the co-accused. Yet the facts before me contain allegations that the offender confessed her role and that of the co-accused. Therefore, a report of these sentencing remarks might provide potential jurors with material highly prejudicial to the co-accused yet not admissible in evidence against them. 
     
      
    4 For those reasons, the publication of these remarks so as to identify the offender, the deceased or the two co-accused or by relating the facts of the offence upon which the offender is sentenced will very likely have the result that the trial will be unable to proceed. I do not believe I have the power to forbid publication of these matters and it is inappropriate to close the court. But the likelihood that any publication of such material would prejudice the fair trial of the accused next month is so great, that I would recommend legal advice be sought before a decision is made to publish the remarks or any part of them. I intend to use pseudonyms for the names of the alleged co-offenders and the deceased. Of course I do not intend any disrespect to the deceased by referring to him by a single initial. 
     
      
    5 On 6 February last, the offender pleaded guilty to an indictment containing a single count alleging that on 22 February 2003 she murdered a man whom I shall refer to as M. For that offence she is now to be sentenced. 
     
      
    6 The Crown has tendered a statement of facts, some photographs of the scene of the killing and plans of the premises in which the deceased met his death. This is the only material upon which the parties have asked me to determine the facts upon which the offender is to be sentenced. However, as there is no dispute about the facts and because the statement sets out a full and sufficient account of the offender’s role in the killing, there is little need for me to take time to set out the facts and circumstances in any great detail. For the purposes of sentencing the offender they can be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    7 The deceased was the husband of an alleged co-offender, W, and lived with his wife and three children in the premises in Muswellbrook in which he met his death. W had no paid employment but the deceased worked as a boilermaker with a local construction company. He had been informed shortly before his death that overtime would no longer be available, the consequence of which would have been a significant reduction in his salary. On 5 February W took out insurance on her own life and that of her husband. She stood to receive over $200,000 in the event of her husband’s accidental death. 
     
      
    8 The offender was a friend of the deceased’s wife and had at one stage stayed a couple of nights at the premises where the deceased lived with his wife and children. 
     
      
    9 On 22 February 2003 the deceased was apparently shot through the head while he lay on a sofa in the loungeroom. At 1.48am his wife made a 000 call seeking an ambulance. She told the operator that a person had broken into her home and injured her husband. She explained that she had been awoken by a noise, smelt something unusual and discovered her husband lying on the sofa bleeding from the head. 
     
      
    10 A short time later, she spoke to a police officer, after having again made a second 000 call. She repeated her earlier account of an intruder, but added that she heard items being thrown about. She also said that she could see her purse and a video camera lying on the floor. 
     
      
    11 A neighbour told police that he had heard what appeared to be a discharge from a small calibre firearm sometime between 1am and 1.30am. 
     
      
    12 When police attended the premises they made observations including that there appeared to have been no struggle in the house, the carpet in the house was unmarked, notwithstanding that it was damp outside, and that no attempt had been made to stem the flow of blood from the head of the deceased. 
     
      
    13 About a week after the killing the offender made admissions separately to her sister and a friend as to her part in the killing of the deceased. The effect of those admissions was to give the following account. The deceased’s wife had been planning the killing of her husband for some time and had harassed the offender into assisting. On the night of the killing the wife ensured that the house would be open and the deceased lying on the sofa where he was shot. The offender had driven another alleged co-offender, a juvenile who will be referred to as T, to the premises. T entered the house and “did it”. They then got rid of the weapon and returned to T’s house for the night. The next day T and the offender went to the premises and helped the wife clean up and dispose of the bloodstained sofa. Shortly after the killing W had promised the offender either a car or money when she collected on her husband’s insurance policy. 
     
      
    14 The friend of the offender had seen her and T embrace one another after the killing both being in a distressed state because of what they had done. T told the friend that W had placed a video camera and a wallet on the floor to make it appear that there had been a robbery. 
     
      
    15 When the offender was arrested, police located a bag in which was found a note containing a floor plan of the deceased’s premises. Two ticks had been placed on the sketch in the position where the deceased had been found lying dead. 
     
      
    16 After her arrest the deceased’s wife told a fellow prisoner, who shall be referred to as R, that she had offered the offender and T $20,000 each for their involvement in the killing and had supplied them with money for the purchase of a weapon. She also admitted her part in allowing T into the house and then making it appear that there had been an attempted robbery after the killing. She also asked R to fabricate admissions and allege that the offender made them. These admissions were to have the effect of implicating the offender but exculpating the wife. W wrote on a note what she wanted R to tell the authorities. 
     
      
    17 The offender also made admissions to R as to her part in driving T to the premises. She said that W had let T into the house after he had knocked on a window. The offender also asked R to dispose of the towels used to clean up the premises and told her where they had been hidden. This information was ultimately conveyed to the police and the towels recovered. They were identified as coming from a motel into which W had booked the offender and T on the night of the killing. 
     
      
    18 Police recovered a .22 rifle from a backpack located in a dam on the outskirts of Muswellbrook. That rifle was identified as being similar to one that had been seen in the possession of T prior to the killing. Testing of the rifle showed that it was consistent with the weapon used to fire the shot that killed the deceased. 
     
      
    19 On the day after the killing T and the offender had used a cheque in the name of W to make purchases from a retail store. They were also seen in the company of W after the killing and had driven her motor vehicle. 
     
      
    20 These facts reveal a serious offence of premeditated murder for financial reward. They also disclose the very substantial role of the offender in that offence, notwithstanding that it was not she that produced the gun and pulled the trigger. This is one of those cases where, at least on the face of it, there is little difference between the culpability of each of the participants in the joint enterprise that resulted in the death of the deceased. It is unnecessary and inappropriate for me at this point to say much about the criminality alleged against the offender when compared with her alleged co-offenders. But the facts concede that it was the offender who, at the wife’s request, sought out a person who might commit the murder. Although the offender was not at the scene at the time of the killing, she was not far away waiting to drive T away from the scene. 
     
      
    21 Sometimes submissions are made to a sentencing court attempting to distinguish the criminality of one member of a joint criminal enterprise from another by reason of the roles played in committing the crime. Generally those submissions lack substance where the crime committed is that which was the object of the joint criminal enterprise. No such submission was made in the present case, at least so far as the offender and T are concerned. Mr Healy realistically accepted that the criminality of the offender cannot for any practical purpose be distinguished from the person who actually fired the bullet into the deceased’s head. 
     
      
    22 However, Mr Healey did submit that the criminality of the offender was significantly less than the person who planned the killing and recruited her to assist in that enterprise being on the Crown’s case, the wife. The Crown accepted that submission and conceded that W had been able to induce the offender into aiding her by the use of pressure and manipulation. It is the Crown case that W knew that the offender was vulnerable to persuasion because of her dependent personality and her reliance upon illegal drugs. The Crown accepted that whatever sentence might be appropriate for W, were she to be convicted of the offence, the offender should receive a lesser sentence because of her reduced criminality. 
     
      
    23 The offender was born on 5 August 1976, and was thus aged 26 at the time of the killing. She has a criminal record comprising two offences both arising from her involvement with illegal drug use. In August 2000 she was placed on a bond for three years by the District Court for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. It would appear that this bond was current at the time of the commission of the murder. 
     
      
    24 A psychiatric report by Dr Nielssen is in evidence. It reveals that the offender commenced using amphetamine from the age of 19 during her relationship with a long-distance truck driver. At first she used it orally for recreational purposes but ended up taking it intravenously. She used the drug continuously until her arrest for the murder. She also used cannabis daily. She once spent five days in a rehabilitation clinic without ultimately affecting her use of the drug. No doubt because of her drug addiction, she had not undertaken any paid employment since the age of 21. 
     
      
    25 There is nothing in her formative years that seems to me is of relevance. She had a relatively unremarkable upbringing. She has been involved in two long-term relationships. As a result of one of these she gave birth to two children. They have been in the care of the father since that relationship ended. She had a miscarriage shortly before the murder and believes that event left her in an unstable state of mind. 
     
      
    26 Dr Nielssen reviews the psychiatric history of the offender. She had attempted suicide in 1999 and in 2000 was treated for depression. She has on occasions been taking Lithium and it has been prescribed for her while she has been on remand for the present offence. Although there has been some suggestion in reports concerned with the treatment of the offender prior to the offence that she suffered from a bipolar disorder, Dr Nielssen was not confident that she did. He thought that her depressed states might have been a result of her amphetamine use. 
     
      
    27 More significantly on the question of her culpability for involvement in the offence was Dr Nielssen’s opinion that she might have been hypomanic at the time as a result of her ceasing to take Lithium and re-commencing to use amphetamine. He believes that her hypomania might have impaired her judgment and made her more susceptible to being persuaded by W to join in the enterprise of killing her husband. 
     
      
    28 Although Dr Nielssen gave an account of her involvement in the offence that he obtained from the offender, I am not prepared to act upon it in the absence of evidence from the offender. She seeks to diminish her culpability by stating that she did not believe that T was actually going to carry the plan out and kill the deceased. She said that, although she had taken T near the house knowing that he was going to kill the deceased, she had attempted to persuade him not to do so. 
     
      
    29 In this case agreed facts were tendered and it was acknowledged by the parties that those were to be the facts and circumstances concerning the commission of the offence upon which I was to sentence the offender. In those circumstances I do not believe it is appropriate to take into account facts not set out in the statement but contained in a psychiatric report, especially where they are based upon a self-serving account given by the offender. In fairness to Mr Healey he did not suggest otherwise. 
     
      
    30 I intend to sentence the offender on the basis that she was a willing party to the killing of the deceased and hoped to be rewarded by W for her assistance. But I do accept, as does the Crown, that the offender’s participation should be understood in terms of her being in a state of mind where she was prepared to agree to being involved in a course of conduct which she might otherwise have resisted. But that mitigating factor having been acknowledged, it was still a very serious offence and the offender’s criminality was very high. Again Mr Healey realistically and in his client’s interest did not address the court to the contrary. 
     
      
    31 Nor did he invite the court to find that this was a case where it was inappropriate to include in the sentence a substantial element of general deterrence. In my opinion the applicant’s mental state or psychiatric history was not such that she should be considered as an unsuitable subject for a deterrent sentence. 
     
      
    32 I have been provided with material from her gaol file that reveals that she is coping as best she can with her time in custody and attempting to put it to good use. 
     
      
    33 The applicant pleaded guilty after committal to this Court. However, she indicated a guilty plea before arraignment and the proceedings were brought forward to allow that plea to be entered at the earliest opportunity after committal. It was accepted by both Mr Healey and the Crown that a 20 per cent reduction was appropriate for the utilitarian value of the plea. I also take into account when determining the appropriate sentence that she is contrite and that a significant part of the Crown case against her are the admissions she made to her sister and a friend as a result of her remorse over what she had been talked into doing. 
     
      
    34 There was before the court a victim impact statement from the parents of the deceased expressing the devastating effect that the murder of their son had upon them, his siblings and their families. It was a very restrained and dignified document but not the less moving for that. Of course it was not tendered on the basis that I would increase the sentence by reason of the effect of the killing on those that loved the deceased and I have not done so. 
     
      
    35 The murder being in effect a contract killing, although of a domestic and amateur nature, is in a category towards the very upper end of seriousness for murder offences. It was in my view a crime that warranted a sentence of imprisonment for thirty years notwithstanding her diminished culpability by reason of her mental state at the time. However, I have reduced that sentence by about 25 per cent taking into account the plea and contrition that led to her admitting her guilt to her sister and friend. There are no special circumstances warranting a period of parole of more than a third of the non-parole period. Such a parole period will provide an adequate opportunity for supervision on her release to assist with her rehabilitation after such a lengthy period in custody and there is in my view no other reason to disturb the statutory proportion. 
     
      
    36 The offender is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 22½ years. I set a non-parole period, being the minimum sentence the offender is required to serve before release to parole, of imprisonment for 16½ years. That sentence is to commence on 3 March 2003 and to expire on 2 September 2019. The balance of the term of the sentence is imprisonment for 6 years to date from 3 September 2019.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: Wayne Kelvin Lavender was charged with manslaughter, alternatively dangerous driving occasioning death, in relation to the death of Michael Milne. He was found guilty of manslaughter, and was sentenced to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. Mr Lavender appealed against his conviction and the Crown appealed against the sentence. For convenience, I will refer to Mr Lavender as the appellant and to the Crown as such. 
     
      
       
      The charges 
       
      
    2 By count 1 of the indictment the appellant was charged - 
     
      
       
        
        “That he on 2 October 2001 at Redhead in the State of New South Wales, did feloniously slay Michael Milne.” 
        
       
      
    3 Manslaughter is a common law offence, but s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides - 
     
      
       
        
        “18  
        Murder and manslaughter defined 
        
       
       
        
        (1) (a) Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years. 
         
         
          
          (b) Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter. 
          
         
         
         
        (2) (a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section. 
         
         
          
          (b) No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    4 By s 24 of the Crimes Act, a person convicted of manslaughter is liable to imprisonment for twenty five years. 
     
      
    5 Upon the appellant’s conviction for manslaughter the alternative charge of dangerous driving occasioning death fell away. Some regard to it, however, is necessary in considering the appellant’s appeal. 
     
      
    6 By count 2 in the indictment the appellant was charged in the alternative - 
     
      
       
        
        “That he on 2 October 2001 in Redhead in the State of New South Wales, did drive a motor vehicle, namely a ‘Komatsu’ loader in a manner dangerous to a person or persons, whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which the death of Michael Milne was occasioned.” 
        
       
      
    7 Dangerous driving occasioning death is a statutory offence under s 52A(1) of the Crimes Act, which relevantly provides -  
     
      
       
        
        “52A  
        Dangerous driving: substantive matters 
        
       
       
        
        (1)  
        Dangerous driving occasioning death. 
        
       
       
        
        A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle:  
         
         
         … 
         
         
        (c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    8 The appellant’s grounds of appeal were - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The learned Trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury that it was for the prosecution to exclude an honest and reasonable belief in the appellant that it was safe to proceed and in directing the jury that the appellant’s belief was ‘immaterial’. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that the belief of the appellant at the relevant time was ‘immaterial’ and that ‘it does not matter’ what the appellant believed to be the case. In particular the learned trial Judge erred in not directing the jury in terms that they should consider the subjective belief of the appellant in determining whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that he acted unreasonably. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The learned trial judge erred in his summing up by treating the offence of manslaughter as an absolute one.” 
        
       
      
    9 The Crown appealed on the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    10 The appellant initially put forward only one ground of appeal, the first ground set out above. At the hearing of the appeal it became apparent that the consideration given by counsel to the issues and the authorities in the appellant’s appeal had not been sufficient for their submissions properly to assist the Court; further, that the appellant might wish to add grounds of appeal. The hearing of the Crown appeal was completed, and the appellant’s appeal was adjourned part-heard with directions as to amendment to the grounds of appeal and further written submissions from the appellant and the Crown. The appellant’s grounds of appeal were amended and the further written submissions were received.  
     
      
    11 The framing of the appellant’s grounds of appeal left some obscurity in the questions for determination. At the trial the appellant’s counsel had asked for a direction that it was for the prosecution to exclude an honest and reasonable belief in the appellant that it was safe to proceed, but there had otherwise been no issue about materiality of the appellant’s subjective belief or whether the offence was an absolute one. The further written submissions were ample, but less than clear in relation to the basis for separate error in these latter respects. It was not practicable to reconvene the Court, and the Court was regrettably deprived of the clarification and development which comes from oral argument.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    12 The appellant was employed at a sand mine at Redhead south of Newcastle. He drove a Komatsu front end loader moving unprocessed sand to the washing plant and processed sand from the plant. The loader was a large vehicle, some 25 tons in weight and much higher and longer than a car. The bucket at the front of the loader impeded the driver’s forward vision.  
     
      
    13 The sand mine was in an area of sand dunes variably covered with vegetation. In places the vegetation was quite thick and comprised bushes and trees up to four metres high, and the vision of a person driving the loader through the vegetation was further impeded. The site of the sand mine was unfenced.  
     
      
    14 On 2 October 2001 Michael Milne and three friends went to the sand mine to play. Michael Milne was thirteen years old. The other boys were aged 11, 14 and 15. The boys had gone to the mine site on previous occasions. Although the site was not fenced and there were no signs, at least one of the boys said that he knew that they should not have been there, and that on a previous occasion they had been told by an employee at the mine not to go to where sand was being taken.  
     
      
    15 The boys were playing on the processed sand pile. The appellant saw them as he was coming out of the lunch room. He knew they were not allowed to be there, and on other occasions had stopped boys and told them to get off the mine site. He said in a police record of interview - 
     
      
       
        
        “… and I hopped in the loader and was gunna go over and speak to them, tell them to move from the premises, you know. So I went after them, you know, and, to try and tell them to get away. 
        
       
       
        
        … I was going over to tell them to get out, off the premises.” 
        
       
      
    16 The appellant drove the loader towards the sand pile. The boys saw him and ran into an area of regenerated scrub part of the thick vegetation. The appellant followed them, driving the loader on a disused track through the scrub at something like four kilometres per hour. He lost sight of the boys as he went along the track. He continued to a place where he could turn around, turned, and went back into the scrub. He saw two of the boys running away from him through the scrub, and left the track and followed them. The other two boys, one of whom was Michael Milne, were hiding behind trees in the scrub. As the appellant drove the loader through the scrub it came into contact with Michael Milne, causing injuries from which he died.  
     
      
    17 Evidence was given in the Crown case by Mr Allan Davis, a fellow employee of the appellant who also chased the boys on a loader on 2 October 2001, and by the three boys who had gone to the sand mine with Michael Milne. Police evidence excluded malfunction of the loader. Other police evidence described the loader, the terrain, the scrub through which the appellant had driven and the area where Michael Milne had been, with many photographs. Edited videos of an ERISP interview and a walk-around interview with the appellant were tendered. There was extensive cross-examination, but in the end little dispute as to the facts. The appellant did not give evidence.  
     
      
       
      The course of the trial 
       
      
    18 It is pertinent to the appellant’s appeal to understand when and how any question of the appellant’s belief arose in relation to the charge of manslaughter. 
     
      
    19 The Crown opened to the jury a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence, through highly negligent behaviour in disregard for the safety of others. The Crown Prosecutor’s opening included - 
     
      
       
        
        “What was that particular behaviour? The Crown relies upon the proposition that the accused, in driving his loader in order to scare the boys off the site, off the property, drove his loader into a bush area where he knew there were four boys in there somewhere, who he couldn’t see, by reason of the nature and structure of his vehicle, couldn’t hear, drove into an area of bush which he traversed for some 140 metres without seeing anybody. Those boys were in there and at one stage frighteningly close to the passage of his loader. He continued to drive his loader, the Crown alleges, in circumstances where the topography , the undulating nature of the surface, the vegetation and the nature and structure of his vehicle, meant that his capacity to see was necessarily restricted, and that he knew or ought to have known, that his capacity to see was necessarily restricted but continued to drive his vehicle in that manner in any event. 
        
       
       
        
        In order for him to proceed through the bush he had to lower his bucket to flatten vegetation before the loader to clear a course for his wheels with the necessary consequences that at one stage dead trees, in the order of 15 to 20 feet, were being flattened in the ongoing course of the loader. The Crown alleges that the accused failed to steer a course which was consistent with safety and that was particularly so once he entered the bush. That he failed to keep a proper lookout and that in the circumstances, once he entered in the bush that he was travelling at a speed which was unsafe in the sense that any speed in those circumstances was unsafe.” 
        
       
      
    20 The Crown Prosecutor also said - 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Members of the jury, just to recap in relation to that first charge of manslaughter, the essence of it is that the Crown alleges that the accused drove the front-end loader in circumstances which created, objectively –  
        that’s to say that a reasonable person in his position would have or ought to have realised that he was creating a high risk that serious injury or death would follow his actions 
        . That’s the essence of it, together with such a serious disregard for the safety of the boys and Michael Milne in particular, that you are satisfied that this was negligence of such a high order as to amount to, to use an old phrase in the law, wicked negligence and of itself a crime against the community. 
        
       
       
        
        You understand, members of the jury, that  
        it doesn’t matter whether the accused intended or not to inflict serious hurt or death and nobody suggests that he did. It’s an objective test whether, in all of those circumstances, a reasonable person in his position would have realised or ought to have realised the danger that was being created, that’s the essence of it 
        .” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    21 Counsel for the appellant opened to the jury at the conclusion of the Crown’s opening. He did not take issue with the Crown Prosecutor’s references to an objective test and to the irrelevance of whether the appellant intended or not to inflict serious hurt or death. He appeared to accept those matters, including as extended to the charge of dangerous driving causing death, saying - 
     
      
       
        
        “First, members of the jury, it is disputed that objectively Mr Lavender was driving in a manner dangerous to the public or to a person or persons. Objectively has been explained to you by my learned friend, no doubt you’ll hear more about it. But what it doesn’t mean is with the wisdom of hindsight. That’s what it doesn’t mean. In other words looking back on what we all now know members of the jury is not the way to assess whether objectively the driving or the manner of driving was dangerous to a person or persons.” 
        
       
      
    22 In relation to the charge of manslaughter, the thrust of counsel’s opening was that the appellant’s actions did not “[come] anywhere near the kind of degree of negligence contemplated by a manslaughter charge”, and that Michael Milne’s death was not attributable to the appellant’s actions but to his own “unexpected and unpredictable act”. Counsel summarised the appellant’s position - 
     
      
       
        
        “It is disputed that Mr Lavender drove in a manner dangerous. It is disputed that the Crown would be in a position to establish the high degree of negligence required for a charge of manslaughter. It will be disputed that Mr Lavender’s acts caused the death of Michael Milne and it will be disputed that the death was in any way attributable to those acts.” 
         
        
       
      
    23 There was a hint of regard to the appellant’s belief, but no more, when towards the end of counsel’s opening he said -  
     
      
       
        
        “You will be, I anticipate invited by me to infer, that he had simply no idea that the boy would take the action which I have described as unpredictable, that action of hiding in that area, in the path of the car. And you might think relevant to that is evidence you’ll hear as to the noise of the vehicle and evidence again of the speed of the vehicle and evidence of Mr Roddom, Aaron Roddom, as to what he did.” 
        
       
      
    24 As I have said, the appellant did not give evidence. The interviews recorded in the videos did not deal with the appellant’s belief as to whether it was safe for him to proceed, save that in relation to turning off the track and having to push a lot of dead timber over - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q197 Would, I know this probably a hard question to answer, with the advantage of hindsight, but wouldn’t you think that was dangerous? 
         
         
        A Well the boys were a long way in front of me by then. 
         
         
        Q198 But wasn’t it the case that initially you’ve seen four boys, on the sand pile? 
         
         
        A I did see four on the sand pile, yeah. 
         
         
        Q199 So at this stage you know where two are. 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q200 Did you know where the other two were [sic]? 
         
         
        A No, I didn’t. 
         
         
        … (deleted) 
         
         
        SENIOR CONSTABLE BOSWELL 
         
         
        Q203 So what were you thinking at the time? 
         
         
        A To tell them, to try and stop the boys and tell them to get out of the property, the property.” 
        
       
      
    25 In relation to the charge of manslaughter, the Crown Prosecutor’s address to the jury began - 
     
      
       
        
        “In order for the Crown to make out that offence it has to satisfy you, as I told you at the outset, of the ingredients, the elements that go to make up that offence and they consist of the Crown satisfying you firstly, that Michael Milne died; secondly, that Michael Milne died as a consequence of the actions of the accused; thirdly, that the accused owed a duty of care to Michael Milne, and indeed to any person who was in the vicinity of his loader when it was operating; next, that the accused acted in and with reckless disregard for the safety of the boys, and more particularly Michael Milne; next, that the actions of the accused created a high risk that serious injury or death would follow. 
        
       
       
        
        You understand that the Crown does not have to establish that the accused intended to create this level of danger, or even that he appreciated there was such a level of danger. Only that in an objective sense, in the sense that a reasonable person observing these events would say to themselves, ‘This conduct has reached this particular level’. I will have more to say about that objective test a little later. It matters not for the purpose of this test whether the accused intended or even appreciated the danger that was being created by his actions 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        Finally, it is a matter for you as representatives of the community – that’s what you are, that’s what you’re here for – to determine that the actions of the accused were of such a high disregard for the safety of Michael Milne as to amount of itself to a crime; to amount of itself to conduct deserving of punishment.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    26 The Crown Prosecutor later spoke of “this objective test of negligence of conduct amounting to driving in a manner dangerous”, and his address was predicated on an objective test as to both the charge of manslaughter and the charge of dangerous driving occasioning death. 
     
      
    27 Only towards the end of the address of counsel for the appellant was there reference to the appellant’s belief that it was safe to proceed. Counsel said, after referring to some evidence of the boys’ movements through the scrub (the transcript appears to have errors, but the substance is there) - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … Mr Lavender thought it was safe to proceed. He thought it was safe to continue on that track, having gone through it once and out the other side and coming back, he thought it was safe to proceed. 
        
       
       
        
        I’d ask you to infer that that is what he believed and that he believed it honestly and that he believed it reasonably. And that’s where my learned friend says his state of mind has nothing to do with it, where, perhaps, that’s putting it a bit strong. Submit that he honestly and reasonably held the belief that it was safe to proceed and that the fatal moment happened after that dramatic conversation between Mr Roddom and Mr Milne in which Mr Milne made that decision. 
        
       
       
        
        My respectful submission those findings of fact are put not guilty verdicts in relation to both of these charges. I submit that commonsense and an application of the directions that his Honour will give you about this crime of felonious slaying or manslaughter, or gross or criminal negligence, would lead you to the conclusion that Mr Lavender did not act with such a high degree of recklessness as to found, by community standards, a conviction for that crime. 
        
       
       
        
        I submit to you in relation to the second charge, members of the jury, that those facts, as I urge you to find them, are such that objectively he was not driving in a manner dangerous to the public. I don’t mean to be repetitive, and I am, but objectively does not mean objectively (with the benefit of hindsight) or knowing what we know now.” 
        
       
      
    28 A little later counsel said, referring to both charges - 
     
      
       
        
        “Fifth, that Mr Lavender honestly and reasonably believe that he was safe to proceed. These crimes are not absolute crimes, they’re not crimes of intention, but nor are they absolute crimes. That is to say, a crime where the Crown doesn’t have to prove any state of mind. No, if he honestly and reasonably believed in a set of facts which, if true, would render his actions innocent then he is to be found not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    29 It is unfortunate that the question of the appellant’s belief, more specifically his honest and reasonable belief that it was safe to proceed, arose in this way and, it must be said, in a rather confusing manner. There had been no indication that it was to be raised with the jury. The judge was placed in a difficult position if, as turned out to be the case, he ruled that the appellant’s honest and reasonable belief should not be part of his directions to the jury. And the judge and the Crown were hampered by lack of notice in the consideration they could give to what the appeal has shown to be a difficult area. 
     
      
       
      The summing-up 
       
      
    30 The transcript records, at the conclusion of the address of counsel for the appellant and before adjournment to the next day - 
     
      
       
        
        “IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY

        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well your Honour, that’s available to my friend - 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: - it’s subsumed within the section and the Crown simply says that the actions weren’t reasonable. As it does in regard to any question of lawfulness. Of the actions of the boys I mean, in being on the site at all.” 
        
       
      
    31 The “defence under section 52A” appears to have been the defence in s 52A(8) of the Crimes Act, relevantly that the death occasioned by the impact was not in any way attributable to the speed at or manner in which the vehicle was driven. The “Proudman v Dayman issue” was a reference to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake considered in Proudman v Dayman (1941) 67 CLR 536. In relation to the offence of permitting an unlicensed driver to drive a motor vehicle on a road, in that case Dixon J said (at 540) - 
     
      
       
        
        “It is one thing to deny that a necessary ingredient of the offence is positive knowledge of the fact that the driver holds no subsisting licence. It is another to say that an honest belief founded on reasonable grounds that he is licensed cannot exculpate a person who permits him to drive. As a general rule an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make the defendant’s act innocent affords an excuse for doing what would otherwise be an offence.” 
        
       
      
    32 The appellant submitted that the Crown accepted at this point that the jury should be directed that it was for the prosecution to exclude an honest and reasonable belief in the appellant that it was safe to proceed, and that the Crown later reneged. I do not agree. The Crown Prosecutor appears to have taken the “Proudman v Dayman issue” as material only to the charge of dangerous driving occasioning death, perhaps because the judge referred to it immediately after referring to “the defence under s 52A”, and his response was that it was “subsumed within the section”. He appears to have meant that the “issue” was available to the appellant in that proof of objectively dangerous driving necessarily negated a reasonable belief that it was safe to proceed. The Crown Prosecutor’s perception of the materiality of the issue, and his response, may have been incorrect, but the debate on the next day suggests that he would have responded in a similar way in relation to the charge of manslaughter. There was confusion, perhaps because of the unfortunate way in which the question of the appellant’s belief arose. It does not matter. Whatever the Crown’s immediate response, the appellant’s appeal is concerned with the correctness of the course ultimately taken. 
     
      
    33 The next morning the judge provided to counsel written statements of the elements of each of the offences with which the appellant was charged. He proposed that they be provided to the jury. The statement in relation to the charge of manslaughter was - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        COUNT 1 - Manslaughter 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown must prove to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt  
        ALL 
         of the following: 
        
       
       
        
        1. That on 2 October 2001 the accused had a duty of care to Michael Milne. 
         
         
        2. That the accused was negligent in that by his actions that day he was in breach of that duty of care. 
         
         
        3. That such actions were deliberate. 
         
         
        4. That such actions of the accused caused the death of Michael Milne. 
         
         
        5. That such actions: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) fell so far short of the standard of care which a reasonable person would have expected in the circumstances; and  
           
           
          (ii) involved such a high risk that death or really serious bodily harm would follow that the actions merit criminal punishment.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 The Crown had no objection to the form of the statement. Counsel for the appellant said - 
     
      
       
        
        “HAMILL: You Honour, I would invite your Honour to add, in relation to the manslaughter, a sixth element, being that the accused did not hold an honest and reasonable belief that it was safe to proceed.” 
        
       
      
    35 Counsel did not ask for a similar addition in relation to dangerous driving occasioning death: perhaps he would have done so in due course, but the debate moved on. The judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Well, that was the next thing I was going to talk to you about. I don’t see any room for a Proudman v Dayman type issue in either of these counts. If the Crown establishes the necessary element of negligence to the required degree, he couldn’t, in any circumstances, as a matter of law, I would have thought, the test being an objective one, have said that the accused may have had a reasonable belief that it was safe to proceed. Likewise with the count of driving in a manner dangerous.” 
        
       
      
    36 In the exchanges which followed counsel for the appellant referred to Jiminez v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 572, a case of dangerous driving occasioning death in which it was held that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was available. He submitted that “the same applies here”, and that the jury could infer from the records of interview that the appellant “believed in all the circumstances that it was safe to drive”. The transcript records - 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: There is no doubt in my mind that the jury would be entitled to draw a conclusion, on the evidence, that Mr Lavender thought it was safe to drive into the bush. But the question of reasonableness is an objective test, is it not? 
        
       
       
        
        HAMILL: It’s an objective test, as it is in dangerous driving, and as it was in Jiminez. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well, in the manslaughter count, before the Crown could succeed, the jury would have to find objectively that the accused was negligent and that that negligence was of such a high degree that it merited criminal punishment. Also as a matter of objectivity, how can it then be said that he could have held a reasonable belief that it was safe to proceed, if the jury are satisfied of that? 
        
       
       
        
        HAMILL: But the same applies, in my submission, as a matter of principle to that case of Jiminez.” 
        
       
      
    37 The judge called on the Crown. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there was “nothing in the evidence that would support the holding on the part of the accused of such a positive belief [as to safety to proceed], as distinct from simply not adverting to the possibility”. The judge said that he was “against you on that”, and asked, “But what about the question of reasonableness?”  
     
      
    38 The judge expressed some discontent with the Crown’s response to this question, it seems because the response was to the effect that the evidence did not support the holding of a reasonable belief and his Honour thought that it did not engage with whether there was room for the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. The transcript records - 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I think what I am trying to say, Mr Crown, is that the Proudman v Dayman type issue, in such cases as Jiminez, seems to arrive in the main where there is some latent defect, such as in a dangerous driving situation, where a person is driving with defective brakes, that they may not know it and may not have any cause to know it, so that the driving is objectively dangerous, but because of that, because they hold an honest and reasonable belief that the case is in sound mechanical order, they are entitled to be acquitted on the Proudman v Dayman issue. 
        
       
       
        
        And likewise in Jiminez, where the driving was said to have been dangerous because the accused went to sleep, it was, as I understand it, applicable in that case because he, whilst the driving was objectively dangerous, he had no warning that he was about to go to sleep and held an honest and reasonable belief in the circumstances, or may have, that it was safe to proceed. 
        
       
       
        
        But those cases seem to be to be different to a case such as here, where no such latent problem arises, but where it’s the manner of driving that is very much in issue, and at all relevant times the evidence is that the accused was acting voluntarily. So that if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on count 1, that the accused was negligent and that that negligence was of such a high degree that it warranted criminal punishment as being an offence against the State, it couldn’t then be said that any belief that he had that it was safe to proceed was reasonable. 
        
       
       
        
        Likewise in the case of driving in a manner dangerous, if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the driving was dangerous in the way in which the Crown alleges, then it couldn’t be said, the test also being an objective one, that any belief that Mr Lavender had could have been a reasonable belief. That’s as I see it. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: With respect, your Honour, I agree. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: If the jury aren’t satisfied that the negligence was of such a high degree in count 1 as to constitute that element of manslaughter, then they don’t get to a Proudman v Dayman situation; the verdict is not guilty. Likewise, if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the driving alleged in count 2 was dangerous in the sense in which the Crown alleges, gain they don’t get to the Proudman v Dayman issue. Whereas in the cases that I have researched, and in particular in Jiminez, it was only after, really, the jury concluded that the driving objectively was dangerous that the Proudman v Dayman issue then arose. It seems to me it can’t arise in these charges. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour, I agree.” 
        
       
      
    39 The judge returned to counsel for the appellant. Their exchanges included - 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Do you say that a jury could come to the conclusion objectively in count 1 that the negligence – that there was negligence and that it was of such a high degree that it was deserving of criminal punishment, but that, nonetheless, the accused may have held a belief that it was safe to proceed and that belief objectively was reasonable? 
        
       
       
        
        HAMILL: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That seems to me to make no sense at all.” 
        
       
      
    40 Counsel for the appellant referred to no authority other than Jiminez v The Queen. The Crown Prosecutor referred to no authority at all. The judge did not receive much assistance, although his Honour had clearly given much thought to the problem overnight and spoke of “the cases I have researched”. In the end the judge ruled -  
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: My view is, Mr Hamill, that for the reasons that I have said already, that whilst in some cases a Proudman v Dayman type issue could arise, it can’t in these circumstances, and I wouldn’t direct the jury on it.” 
        
       
      
    41 The written statements of the elements of the offences were used in the summing-up. The judge appropriately directed the jury as to the need for a high degree of negligence for the crime of manslaughter. Having summarised the Crown and defence cases as to the extent of negligence, the judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Now members of the jury, they are matters for you to determine. A determination of this question of negligence and the degree of negligence is an objective test. You have to compare the conduct of the accused, as you find it to have been, with the conduct of a reasonable person who possesses the same personal attributes as the accused, that is to say a person of the same age, having the same experience and knowledge as the accused in the circumstances in which he found himself, and having the ordinary fortitude and strength of mind which a reasonable person would have, and determine on that basis whether the Crown has made out its case. In other words, it is an objective test.  
        The Crown does not have to prove that the accused appreciated that he was being negligent or that he was being negligent to such a high degree 
        . It is your task to determine whether having decided on the conduct of the accused, whether his actions amounted to negligence based upon, as I say, what you think a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have done.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    42 As he moved to the charge of dangerous driving occasioning death, the judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Can I just reiterate members of the jury,  
        it is immaterial in this case, both in relation to count 1 and count 2, what the accused believed to be the case at the time 
        . The test is an objective one, that is to say you must try to put yourself in the position of a reasonable person in the position of the accused, same age, knowing what he knows and a person of ordinary fortitude and strength of mind, and ask yourselves would that person have done what the accused did. Was it reasonable for him to have done that? If not, were his actions negligent,  
        were they deliberate, and I do not mean deliberate in the sense of intending to hurt Michael Milne, no one has suggested that, but deliberate in the sense that he had control over his vehicle 
        . Were the actions the cause of Michael Milne’s death and were the actions so far short of the standard of care which a reasonable person would have exercised, and did they involve such a high risk of death or really serious bodily injury that would follow that they merit criminal punishment?” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    43 In the directions as to dangerous driving occasioning death the judge again said that the test as to whether the appellant’s conduct was dangerous was an objective one, that “[i]t does not matter whether the accused thought his driving was safe or dangerous”, and that “the Crown does not have to establish that the accused knew or realised that his driving was dangerous”.  
     
      
    44 In conformity with the earlier ruling, no direction was given that it was for the Crown to prove that the appellant did not hold an honest and reasonable belief that it was safe to proceed. 
     
      
    45 At the conclusion of the summing-up the judge asked if there were any matters to be raised. The Crown Prosecutor had none. Counsel for the appellant said - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … The first thing just concerns the question that we discussed before, your Honour’s comments in relation to the accused’s belief in the course of your summing-up. Obviously my submission is that those are erroneous and effectively make the offences absolute offences when they’re not, and I know your Honour’s heard me on that. So that’s the first one. But that’s really a question of the applicability of the honest and reasonable mistake which your Honour heard me on before the summing-up. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes.” 
        
       
       
      Categories of offences 
       
      
    46 The criminal law has distinguished between offences which require mens rea, offences which do not require mens rea but for which a defence of honest and reasonable mistake is available, and offences which neither require mens rea nor have a defence of honest and reasonable mistake. If the offence requires mens rea, the prosecution must prove that the accused had a state of mind necessary for the offence. Depending on the offence, the state of mind may be motive, intention, recklessness, or particular knowledge or belief. If mens rea is not required but a defence of honest and reasonable mistake is available, the accused must raise the existence of reasonable grounds for believing in, and belief in, a state of facts which if true would mean the offence had not been committed, and it is then for the prosecution to negate the belief or its reasonableness. If mens rea is not required and the defence of honest and reasonable mistake is not available, the offence is said to be absolute. 
     
      
    47 This taxonomy, not universally reflected in the cases or the language used in the cases, has become more significant with the growth of statutory offences, for which it must be decided whether a state of mind is an ingredient of the offence and, if not, whether the defence of honest and reasonable mistake is available. Proudman v Dayman provides an illustration. Each of Rich ACJ and Dixon and McTiernan JJ held that the prosecution did not have to prove knowledge that the driver was unlicensed (at 538, 541-2, and 542-3). Rich ACJ and Dixon J considered that the question of honest and reasonable mistake did not arise on the facts (at 538-9,541), but Dixon J went on to say that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was distinct from the requirement of mens rea and would have been available (at 541). McTiernan J considered that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was not available, but on the basis that it was the obverse of a requirement of mens rea (at 542-3). 
     
      
    48 Dixon J distinguished between the requirement of mens rea and the defence of honest and reasonable mistake, and described the availability of the latter, as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        “It is one thing to deny that a necessary ingredient of the offence is positive knowledge of the fact that the driver holds no subsisting licence. It is another to say that an honest belief founded on reasonable grounds that he is licensed cannot exculpate a person who permits him to drive. As a general rule an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make the defendant's act innocent affords an excuse for doing what would otherwise be an offence.  
        
       
       
        
        The strength of the presumption that the rule applies to a statutory offence newly created varies with the nature of the offence and the scope of the statute. If the purpose of the statute is to add a new crime to the general criminal law, it is natural to suppose that it is to be read subject to the general principles according to which that law is administered. But other considerations arise where in matters of police, of health, of safety or the like the legislature adopts penal measures in order to cast on the individual the responsibility of so conducting his affairs that the general welfare will not be prejudiced. In such cases there is less ground, either in reason or in actual probability, for presuming an intention that the general rule should apply making honest and reasonable mistake a ground of exoneration, and the presumption is but a weak one.  
        
       
       
        
        Indeed, there has been a marked and growing tendency to treat the prima facie rule as excluded or rebutted in the case of summary offences created by modern statutes, particularly those dealing with social and industrial regulation. But, although it has been said that in construing a modern statute a presumption as to mens rea does not exist (per Kennedy L.J,  
        Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation 
        , it is probably still true that, unless from the words, context, subject matter, or general nature of the enactment some reason to the contrary appears, you are to treat honest and reasonable mistake as a ground of exculpation, even from a summary offence.  
        
       
       
        
        There may be no longer any presumption that mens rea, in the sense of a specific state of mind, whether of motive, intention, knowledge or advertence, is an ingredient in an offence created by a modern statute; but to concede that the weakening of the older understanding of the rule of interpretation has left us with no prima facie presumption that some mental element is implied in the definition of any new statutory offence does not mean that the rule that honest and reasonable mistake is prima facie admissible as an exculpation has lost its application also.  
        
       
       
        
        Doubtless over a wide description of legislation the presumption in favour of its application is but a weak one: See  
        Maher v. Musson 
        ;  
        Thomas v. The King 
        , and three papers referred to in that report. But it still remains a presumption, and in relation to s. 30 there appears to be no sufficient reason for treating it as rebutted.  
        
       
       
        
        The burden of establishing honest and reasonable mistake is in the first place upon the defendant and he must make it appear that he had reasonable grounds for believing in the existence of a state of facts, which, if true, would take his act outside the operation of the enactment and that on those grounds he did so believe. The burden possibly may not finally rest upon him of satisfying the tribunal in case of doubt. But, in the present case, the applicant assigned reasons for her alleged belief which neither the magistrate nor the Full Court found convincing or sufficient. Indeed, it may be doubted if she thought at all upon the question whether the person she permitted to drive her car did or did not hold a subsisting licence.” 
        
       
      
    49 The tripartite categorisation is reflected in the statement in Jiminez v The Queen at 581-2 - 
     
      
       
        
        “A statutory offence which imposes absolute liability is one which, in addition to excluding the requirement of mens rea, also excludes a defence of honest and reasonable mistake. In a well-known passage in  
        Proudman v Dayman 
        , Dixon J drew a distinction between mens rea as an ingredient of an offence and an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make a defendant's act innocent. If honest and reasonable mistake is not excluded in the case of a statutory offence, it will afford an excuse for what would otherwise be an offence, although the burden of establishing the excuse will in the first place be upon the defendant. The burden on the defendant is evidentiary only, and the prosecution retains the burden of proving guilt by establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant did not honestly believe on reasonable grounds in the existence of facts which, in the circumstances, would take his act outside the operation of the statute.” 
        
       
      
    50 I have observed that the taxonomy is not universally reflected in the cases or the language used in the cases. In He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984) 157 CLR 523 Gibbs CJ observed at 533 - 
     
      
       
        
        “These cases establish that if it is held that guilty knowledge is not an ingredient of an offence, it does not follow that the offence is an absolute one. A middle course, between imposing absolute liability and requiring proof of guilty knowledge or intention, is to hold that an accused will not be guilty if he acted under an honest and reasonable mistake as to the existence of facts, which, if true, would have made his act innocent. However there are a number of questions which have not been clearly answered. The first is whether the absence of an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of facts which would have made the act innocent is a form of mens rea or whether, on the other hand, an honest and reasonable mistake affords the accused a defence only when he is charged with an offence of which mens rea is not an element. … ” 
        
       
       
      His Honour noted (at 534) that in some cases absence of mens rea had been equated with the honest and reasonable but mistaken belief of the accused. (McTiernan J in  
      Proudman v Dayman 
       took this approach.)  
       
      
    51 Gibbs CJ added - 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be that little turns on the question whether honest and reasonable mistake should be regarded as a special defence available only in cases not requiring mens rea, or as something the absence of which constitutes mens rea. The matter is largely one of words. On either view the words of the statute and the nature of the offence must be considered in deciding what mental state is required, and whether an objective test of reasonableness is to be applied together with the subjective test of whether there was a mistaken belief.” 
        
       
      
    52 In He Kaw Teh v The Queen itself Brennan J referred to the absence of an honest and reasonable but mistaken belief as “a form of mens rea at common law and an element of the offence which the Crown must prove” (at 574), but apparently accepted that it was necessary for the accused to “raise a reasonable doubt as to [the belief’s] non-existence” (ibid). Dawson J distinguished between “mens rea as an ingredient of the offence to be proved by the prosecution” and, if not, an offence “of strict liability which, while not requiring the prosecution to prove mens rea in order to make out a case, allows the accused to raise honest and reasonable mistake by way of exculpation” (at 590). His Honour regarded the latter as “a mental element imported into the offence of strict liability short of requiring proof of mens rea by the prosecution” (ibid), which no doubt explains his observation that “[t]he defence of honest and reasonable mistake stems from the common law requirement of a guilty mind and it is not, as it is sometimes put, a defence based solely or even primarily upon the absence of negligence” (at 592). 
     
      
    53 In R v Wampfler (1987) 11 NSWLR 541 at 546 Street CJ, with whom Hunt and McInerney JJ agreed, rather blended the concepts - 
     
      
       
        
        “He Kaw Teh is authority for the proposition that for the purpose of 
         
        considering criminal intent, statutory offences fall into three categories: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Those in which there is an original obligation on the prosecution to prove mens rea. 
         
         
        (2) Those in which mens rea will be presumed to be present unless and until material is advanced by the defence of the existence of honest and reasonable belief that the conduct in question is not criminal in which case the prosecution must undertake the burden of negativing such belief beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
         
        (3) Those in which mens rea plays no part and guilt is established by proof of the objective ingredients of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    54 There is a difference between a state of mind which the prosecution must prove in the first instance and a belief which the prosecution must negate once a basis has appeared for the accused honestly and reasonably holding it. Further, an honestly but unreasonably held belief may negative a necessary state of mind, but the defence of honest and reasonable mistake looks beyond mere belief to the belief being honestly held and upon reasonable grounds. The difference should be recognised, and remains notwithstanding that, as Dawson J said in He Kaw Teh v The Queen at 592-3 - 
     
      
       
        
        “No doubt the burden of providing the necessary foundation in evidence will in most cases fall upon the accused. But it is not inconceivable that during the case for the prosecution sufficient evidence may be elicited by way of cross-examination or otherwise to establish honest and reasonable mistake or to cast sufficient doubt upon the prosecution case to entitle the accused to an acquittal. The governing principle must be that which applies generally in the criminal law. There is no onus upon the accused to prove honest and reasonable mistake upon the balance of probabilities. The prosecution must prove his guilt and the accused is not bound to establish his innocence. It is sufficient for him to raise a doubt about his guilt and this may be done, if the offence is not one of absolute liability, by raising the question of honest and reasonable mistake. If the prosecution at the end of the case has failed to dispel the doubt then the accused must be acquitted.” 
        
       
       
      The questions in the appellant’s appeal 
       
      
    55 The principal question, found in the original ground 1, was concerned with the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. The assertion in ground 1 of error in directing the jury that the appellant’s belief was immaterial was another way of expressing error in declining to direct the jury on the “Proudman v Dayman issue”. The question involved the sub-questions whether the defence was available at all, and if it was, whether there was evidence which raised it so that it fell to the Crown to negate the holding of the belief or that the belief was held honestly and on reasonable grounds.  
     
      
    56 Ground 2 must have been concerned with something else. On one view it was concerned with mens rea, and the question was whether, quite apart from negation of an honest and reasonable mistake, it was necessary for the prosecution to prove a state of mind to which the appellant’s belief was relevant. On another view it was not concerned with mens rea, and the question was whether the belief of the appellant was relevant to determining whether the Crown had proved a high degree of negligence. 
     
      
    57 Ground 3 was consistent with the latter view of ground 2. If it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove a state of mind to which the appellant’s belief was relevant, a negative answer to the principal question would mean that the offence was an absolute one. Alternatively, ground 3 could have been intended to reinforce the former view of ground 2. In either event, it did not add anything. 
     
      
    58 It was tolerably clear that Ground 2 was intended to assert error in that the belief of the appellant was relevant to determining whether the Crown had proved a high degree of negligence. Whether it was intended to assert error in relation to mens rea was obscured by generalities and imprecision in the submissions. I have earlier referred to the circumstances whereby there was not clarification and development from oral argument. There was sufficient suggestion of the latter error, however, that the better course is to address both questions within ground 2. 
     
      
    59 The appellant’s submissions relied on s 18(2)(a) of the Crimes Act. In considering the questions in the appellant’s appeal I will initially pass over that provision, and will come to it separately later in these reasons. 
     
      
       
      The principal question in the appellant’s appeal: the defence of honest and reasonable mistake 
       
      
    60 The two categories of involuntary manslaughter at common law are (a) causing death by an unlawful and dangerous act carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury and (b) causing death by criminal negligence (Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313 at 333).  
     
      
    61 The element of lack of care in manslaughter by criminal negligence has been variously stated. An accepted statement, on which the judge’s directions were founded, is that in Nydam v The Queen (1977) VR 430 at 445, namely - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment”.  
        
       
      
    62 The obvious difficulty in applying the notion of meriting criminal punishment has often been noted, but was not in issue in the appeal. There must be lack of care and risk of death or injury to a degree meriting criminal punishment, hence the shorthand of criminal negligence. Lack of care is at the heart of this category of the offence, and it is judged objectively by the standard of the care a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have exercised. 
     
      
    63 Neither at the trial nor on appeal did the appellant dispute that the lack of care alleged against him was to be assessed objectively, according to the standard of care a reasonable person in the position of the appellant would have exercised and thus with the consciousness a reasonable person in that position would have had of the risk to the boys. At the trial the issue was not one of mens rea, but of the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. 
     
      
       
      (a) Was the defence available at all? 
       
      
    64 Dixon J in Proudman v Dayman referred to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake “[a]s a general rule” (at 541). A general rule is not a universal rule. Just as in the case of statutory offence the general rule may be excluded by “the words, context, subject matter or general nature of the enactment” (ibid), so also it may be excluded by the nature of the common law offence.  
     
      
    65 The Crown case of manslaughter was that the appellant had been negligent to a high degree, his lack of care being assessed objectively. As a matter of principle the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was not available. If the prosecution proved negligence to a high degree, objectively assessed, there could not be reasonable grounds for belief in a state of facts which, if true, would mean that the offence had not been committed; on the same objective assessment, any such belief formed by the appellant could not be a reasonable belief. That was the judge’s reasoning, and while it may not have been correct as to dangerous driving occasioning death I consider that it was correct as to manslaughter.  
     
      
    66 The appellant relied on R v Lamb (1967) 2 QB 981 and Jiminez v The Queen.  
     
      
    67 In R v Lamb the accused was charged with manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act and by criminal negligence. He pointed a revolver at his friend, in jest, and pulled the trigger. The revolver had two bullets in the chambers, neither being opposite the barrel, and he did not intend to fire a bullet. Pulling the trigger rotated the chambers and placed a bullet opposite the barrel, so that it fired. The accused’s defences included that he was not aware that pulling the trigger would bring a bullet into the firing position opposite the barrel and that the killing was an accident. There was evidence that the accused’s mistake was natural for someone unaware of the way in which the revolver’s mechanism worked.  
     
      
    68 The directions were such that this defence was not left to the jury. On appeal it was said by Sachs LJ (at 990) - 
     
      
       
        
        “When the gravamen of a charge is criminal negligence – often referred to as recklessness – of an accused, the jury have to consider among other matters the state of his mind, and that includes the question of whether or not he thought that that which he was doing was safe. In the present case it would, of course, have been fully open to a jury, if properly directed to find the defendant guilty because they considered his view as to there being no danger was formed in a criminally negligent way. But he was entitled to a direction that the jury should take into account the fact that he had undisputedly formed that view and that there was expert evidence as to this being an understandable view.” 
        
       
      
    69 The appellant submitted that this supported the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. He said that underlying it was that the accused honestly and reasonably believed that a bullet would not be brought into the firing position opposite the barrel, a fact which if true would make his act innocent. I do not agree. When considering mens rea later in these reasons I refer to the ambiguity of recklessness and to the former recognition in England of reckless manslaughter. R v Lamb was an instance of importation of recklessness into manslaughter, whereby the accused’s state of mind became relevant. That was different from the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. The accused’s belief of itself would not have made his act innocent, because holding the belief was consistent with lack of care in, amongst other things, coming to and acting on the belief. This passage from R v Lamb was not concerned with the defence of honest and reasonable mistake.  
     
      
    70 The appellant in R v Taylor (1983) 9 A Crim R 358, a case of manslaughter by overdosing a sedative, relied on the same passage in R v Lamb. She submitted that a doctor’s advice that it was safe to use a dosage over 5 ml might have led to a mistaken belief in the safety of a large dose. Lush J, with whom Young CJ and O’Bryan J agreed, said (at 359-60) - 
     
      
       
        
        “The first sentence quoted from the judgment of Sachs LJ is, with respect, not good law either in England or in Victoria. In England, in  
        Newbury 
         [1977] AC 500 at 509, Lord Salmon treated  
        Lamb’s 
         case as not opposed to the general body of authority that in manslaughter all that is required is an intention to do the acts which led to death. In the same speech, at 506-507, his Lordship approved authority which makes it clear that in manslaughter the question whether what was done was dangerous is to be objectively determined without regard to the particular belief of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        In Victoria the sentence under discussion is diametrically opposed to a statement of this Court on the same point in  
        Nydam 
         [1977] VR 430 at 444: ‘The requisite mens rea in the latter crime’ (that is manslaughter by negligence) ‘does not involve a consciousness on the part of the accused of the likelihood of his acts causing death or serious bodily harm to the victim … ‘. 
        
       
       
        
        This Court has in a recent case,  
        Wills 
         [1983] VR 201, again applied the objective test to the determination of the potential danger of the accused’s acts, and has commented on the question of the ’circumstances’ which are relevant to the formation of the objective assessment. 
        
       
       
        
        The final sentence quoted from the judgment of Sachs LJ may, if I may say so with respect, be accepted as a statement that in inquiring whether a reasonable man would have realised that the act was dangerous, the jury would have been entitled to consider, and in the circumstances should have been directed to consider, whether a reasonable man might have entertained the mistaken belief held by the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        All that the applicant was entitled to in the present case was a direction that, in deciding whether or not a reasonable man in all the circumstances would have regarded the administration of a large dose of Noctec as dangerous, they should regard as among the circumstances which were to be taken into account and in which the hypothetical reasonable man was to be placed the facts that the doctors had given the prescriptions and the advice as to dosage to which I have referred.” 
        
       
      
    71 R v Lamb was distinguished in R v Lipman (1970) 1 QB 152, a case of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act in which it was said that, apart from the intent necessary for the unlawful act, “no specific intent has to be proved to convict of manslaughter” (at 156). This did not directly bear upon the passage presently under consideration, which was concerned with manslaughter by criminal negligence. If it is not necessary that an accused appreciate that his conduct was dangerous for manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, however, it should not be necessary for manslaughter by criminal negligence. Culpability through unlawfulness is not present, but its equivalent is the high degree of negligence. In Director of Prosecutions v Newbury (1977) AC 500 Lord Salmon said at 509 that R v Lamb was not authority that manslaughter needs more than an intention to do the acts which constitute the crime. 
     
      
    72 In Jiminez v The Queen the applicant was charged with culpable driving under an earlier version of s 52A of the Crimes Act which required that at the time of the impact causing death he was driving the vehicle “at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public”. The Crown case was that the applicant had been tired and drowsy and had fallen asleep.  
     
      
    73 In the judgment of Mason CJ and Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ it was said that for the driving to be dangerous there “must be some feature which is identified not as a want of care but which subjects the public to some risk over and above that ordinarily associated with the driving of a motor vehicle”, and it was emphasised “that the condition of a driver must amount to something other than a lack of due care before it can support a finding of driving in a manner dangerous to the public “ (at 579). After citing from McBride v The Queen (1966) 115 CLR 44 at 49-50 per Barwick CJ, their Honours said (at 579-80) - 
     
      
       
        
        “It follows that for a driver to be guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public because of his tired or drowsy condition that condition must be such that, as a matter of objective fact, his driving in that condition is a danger to the public. Various matters will be relevant in reaching such a conclusion. The period of the driving, the lighting conditions (including whether it was night or day) and the heating or ventilation of the vehicle are all relevant considerations. And, of course, it will be necessary to consider how tired the driver was. If there was a warning as to the onset of sleep that may be some evidence of the degree of his tiredness. And the period of driving before the accident and the amount of sleep that he had earlier had will also bear on the degree of his tiredness. But so far as ""driving in a manner dangerous"" is concerned, the issue is not whether there was or was not a warning of the onset of sleep, but whether the driver was so tired that, in the circumstances, his driving was a danger to the public.” 
        
       
      
    74 After referring to the decision in R v Gosney (1971) 55 Crim App R 502, their Honours said (at 583) - 
     
      
       
        
        “To our eyes what the appellant was attempting to do in Gosney was to establish an honest and reasonable mistake, a defence which, in this country, makes it unnecessary to introduce fault as an element of that offence. Driving in a manner dangerous to the public is at once both the offence and, if it is relevant, the fault, but it will be a defence to establish an honest and reasonable mistake as to facts which if true would exculpate the driver. Perhaps the most obvious example is where a driver is unaware of the defective condition of his vehicle and believes it upon reasonable grounds to be in good working order. And the same issue is raised when, in a case like the present where the dangerous manner of the driving is said to consist in the likelihood of going to sleep, a driver claims that he had no warning of the onset of sleep.  
        
       
       
        
        It follows from what has been said above that it was necessary for the prosecution in the present case to establish that the applicant was affected by tiredness to an extent that, in the circumstances, his driving was objectively dangerous. It was open to the jury to draw an inference to that effect from a finding that the applicant went to sleep at the wheel. It was, however, also open to the jury to find that the applicant honestly and reasonably believed that, in all the circumstances, it was safe to drive. Apart from any inference that might be drawn from the fact that the applicant had fallen asleep, there was little in the evidence to support a finding that the applicant had felt drowsy or that he had reason to believe that he was tired. He had had four hours' sleep shortly before setting out on the trip and a further period of up to three hours while the deceased woman drove the car. He had not been driving for an excessive period before the accident. There was no evidence before the jury that he had consumed any alcohol or drugs. He was thinking of stopping at the next town, but that could be explained by his statement that he intended to have breakfast there. The fact that he slept for some hours after the accident could, in the light of the other evidence including evidence that he was emotionally upset and affected by grief, scarcely found an inference that he had had insufficient sleep beforehand. In these circumstances, the inference that the applicant believed that, in all the circumstances, it was safe to drive might have been drawn by the jury from the very fact of his driving. The absence of any warning of the onset of sleep, if the jury found that there had been none, laid a foundation for that being an honest and reasonable belief. Lack of warning as to the onset of sleep is only one of a number of circumstances that may bear on the question whether a driver honestly and reasonably believed that it was safe for him to drive. Ordinarily, the circumstances which bear on whether the driving was dangerous will also bear on this question.  
        
       
       
        
        If, in a case based on tiredness, there is material suggesting that the driver honestly believed on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive, the jury must be instructed with respect to that issue. In particular, they must be told that if they conclude that the driving was a danger to the public, they must also consider whether the driver might honestly have believed on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive. And, of course, they must be instructed in appropriate terms that the onus of negativing that defence rests with the prosecution.”  
        
       
      
    75 The appellant cited R v Warner (1979) 1 A Crim R 18, without explanation but presumably for the observation (at 21), with reference to R v Gosney (1971) 2 QB 674 at 680, that fault or culpability on the part of the driver was necessary for dangerous driving. In R v Buttsworth (1983) 1 NSWLR 658 O’Brien CJ of Cr D, with whom Street CJ and Nagle CJ at CL agreed, considered that dangerous driving involved “a degree of negligence for the safety of other road users” (at 686), and although accepting that it was not sufficient to describe it as a degree of negligent driving said that it was correctly described as “being that degree of negligence which amounts to a manner of driving which is dangerous to the public”. I do not think this has survived Jiminez v The Queen. Driving without due care and attention may amount to dangerous driving, but the negligence is not what makes the offence.  
     
      
    76 The appellant submitted, as had been submitted to the judge, that the acceptance in Jiminez v The Queen of the defence of honest and reasonable mistake flowed through to manslaughter by criminal negligence. He said that the reasoning was equally applicable. I do not agree. In Jiminez v The Queen the offence depended on proof of the driver’s condition, a condition which made his driving dangerous to the public. It did not depend on the driver failing to take due care in falling into that condition or in driving while in that condition, and their Honours did not regard fault as an element of the offence. Since the offence depended on the fact of the driver being affected by tiredness to an extent that his driving was objectively dangerous, there was room for the defence of honest and reasonable mistake as to that fact, described by their Honours as honest and reasonable belief that it was safe to drive. For the reasons I have given, it is otherwise for the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence. 
     
      
    77 Jiminez v The Queen has relevantly been considered in two subsequent decisions. Neither assists the appellant’s submission.  
     
      
    78 In R v Franks (1999) 1 VR 518 the applicant was charged with culpable driving under s 318(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic), which provided that a person drives a motor vehicle culpably if he drives it - 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) negligently, that is to say, if he fails unjustifiably and to a gross degree to observe the standard of care which a reasonable man would have observed in all the circumstances of the case”. 
        
       
       
      The offence depended on proof of negligence, and it was said that the standard of care of which the provision spoke was “the equivalent of criminal negligence sufficient to support the crime of manslaughter” (at 520).  
       
      
    79 The applicant had been driving a semi-trailer which collided with the rear of a truck. The Crown case was that the applicant had driven for excessive periods over a number of days leading up to the accident and had had inadequate rest in that time, and that the gross departure from the standard of care of the reasonable driver lay in his continuing to drive the semi-trailer when he was or should have been aware of the risk of falling asleep or being unable to react to foreseeable contingencies. It was held that the jury had been misdirected in a number of respects, only one of which is presently relevant. 
     
      
    80 Winneke P said (at 527-8) - 
     
      
       
        
        “It was also erroneous in my view for his Honour to have told the jury that, in considering the “simple issue” of “fatigue”, they could take into account whether the accused “might honestly have believed on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive”. Quite apart from the fact that the jury were not directed to the time at which the accused might have held such a belief, it was simply not relevant to the establishment of the offence created by s. 318 of the Crimes Act, at least where the offence is alleged to have been constituted by “grossly negligent driving”, for the jury to determine whether the accused had an honest belief that it was safe for him to drive or whether that belief was based on reasonable grounds. It seems that his Honour was induced to give such a direction as a consequence of the decision of the High Court in Jiminez v. R. at 582, where the court held that a “defence” of “honest and reasonable mistake” would be available in a charge of “causing death by dangerous driving”. Although such a “defence” can be raised to a charge which depends for its proof upon the Crown establishing that the relevant driving was objectively dangerous, it cannot in my view have any relevance to an offence which depends for its proof upon the establishment that the relevant driving of the accused departed so far from the standard of care expected of the reasonable and prudent driver that it amounted to “gross negligence”. Although Mr. Francis sought to argue before this court that such a “defence” could be raised to the charge in this case, and that the judge had misdirected the jury in respect of it, I cannot accept that contention. The misdirection is to be found in inviting the jury to consider the beliefs of the accused. In a case where it was being asserted by the Crown that the accused had driven for excessive periods over 18 days and had falsely and inaccurately recorded the extent of that driving, an invitation to the jury to consider generally the honesty and reasonableness of the accused’s beliefs was calculated to divert the jury’s attention from the focal issue in the case; an issue which was quite unrelated to his beliefs, whether they were honest or dishonest, reasonable or unreasonable, or otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    81 Tadgell JA said (at 532) - 
     
      
       
        
        “The judge’s instruction to the jury, in effect, that they were at large to decide that the applicant’s driving when fatigued could constitute gross negligence was a misdirection. So also was the instruction that the jury “must decide whether [the applicant] might honestly have believed on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive”. This was not an issue in the case; and to continue by way of instruction to the jury that ""[i]f you do come to [the] conclusion that he believed on reasonable grounds that it was safe for him to drive, then of course the prosecution must negate that by the evidence it has adduced” was, I am obliged to say, calculated to confuse the jury as to the onus of proof.” 
        
       
      
    82 Batt JA agreed that the trial miscarried in the respects identified by Winneke P, and said (at 533) that Jiminez v The Queen was distinguishable. 
     
      
    83 In R v Osip (2000) 116 A Crim R 578 the applicant shot a man whom he mistook for deer. He was found guilty of manslaughter by criminal negligence. He submitted that the judge erred in failing to direct the jury that it was for the Crown to exclude beyond reasonable doubt the possibility that when he fired he honestly and reasonably, although mistakenly, believed that he was firing at a deer. Batt JA, with whom Phillips CJ and Tadgell JA agreed, said (at [35]) - 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, contrary to a submission for the applicant, the ‘defence’ of honest  
        and reasonable 
         mistake is subsumed in the direction as to gross negligence. In essence, the jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, in his Honour’s words, the act or acts of the accused was or were performed by him ‘in circumstances which involve such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable person would have exercised … ‘ without concluding that any belief which the applicant had that the target at which he aimed was a deer was not a reasonable belief. Mr Ross submitted that the concept of reasonableness was not to be subsumed into the ‘reasonable man aspect’ of the elements of the offence. Reasonableness in the defence of mistake, he said, had never been synonymous with a reasonable man test and it was submitted that no part of the criminal law where reasonable belief or reasonable mistake is referred to equates such reasonableness with the reasonable man. I disagree. The last few lines of the last passage I have set out from the case relied on,  
        Tutton 
        , are directly against the submission as it also a passage in  
        Bank of NSW v Piper 
        , cited by Gibbs CJ in  
        He Kaw Teh 
        . There is, I think, still room for debate whether involuntary manslaughter is a crime without mens rea (as Canadian cases seem to suggest), or whether, relevantly, the gross negligence constitutes mens rea, in the form, for example, of inadvertence or incautiousness. That view is supported by  
        Nydam, Tolson 
         and various text writers. If, as I am at present inclined to think, that is the better view, it supports Mr McArdle’s submission that the ‘defence’ of honest and reasonable mistake was simply a denial of or joinder of issue on mens rea. Even if involuntary manslaughter has no mens rea, the point is substantially the same, in that the ‘defence’ denies or puts in issue the element of gross negligence. The ‘defence’ is, in short, not a superadded matter to be disproved.” (italics in original) 
        
       
      
    84 The applicant had relied, amongst other cases, on Proudman v Dayman and Jiminez v The Queen. Batt JA said (at [36]) that “neither … was a manslaughter case”. After reference to further cases, his Honour said (at [37]) - 
     
      
       
        
        “Here, however, gross negligence or gross fault is an element of the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence, and for the reasons I have earlier given it seems to me inescapable that the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact entails the absence of negligence and that the presence of negligence denies the reasonableness of any relevant mistake. The two cannot co-exist.” 
        
       
      
    85 It will be noted that Batt JA adverted to mens rea, as a possibility “in the form … of inadvertence or incautiousness”. If negligence is proved, the accused was inadvertent or incautious. The accused does not have to be aware that he is inadvertent or incautious – the nature of negligence is such that the accused will generally not be so aware. His Honour appears to have referred to mens rea as a way of describing the element of negligence to a high degree, rather than a state of mind in the accused. Whether or not a state of mind in that form is required, there is no occasion for a separate defence of honest and reasonable mistake. 
     
      
    86 Arguably supporting the appellant’s submission is R v Pacino (1998) 105 A Crim R 309. The deceased was attacked and killed by the applicant’s dogs. The applicant was charged with unlawful killing contrary to s 266 of the Criminal Code (WA), by which he was under a duty to “use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions” in the control of his dogs to avoid endangering the life, health or safety of others. In Callaghan v The Queen (1952) 87 CLR 115 it was held that the same degree of negligence was required as for manslaughter by criminal negligence. The judge declined to leave to the jury the question of honest and reasonable mistake under s 24 of the Criminal Code, reading - 
     
      
       
        
        “24. A person who does or omits to do an act under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief in the existence of any state of things is not criminally responsible for the act or omission to any greater extent than if the real state of things had been such as he believed to exist.” 
        
       
      
    87 Kennedy J, with whom Wallwork and Steytler JJ agreed, said (at 319-20) - 
     
      
       
        
        “It could hardly be described as a case of ""grave moral guilt"" on the part of the applicant if the Crown should not be able ultimately to exclude beyond reasonable doubt that he had an honest and reasonable but mistaken belief that the dogs were not dangerous. It accords with the general rule that an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if they existed, would make the defendant's act innocent, affords an excuse for doing what would otherwise be an offence — see Proudman v Dayman (1941) 67 CLR 536, per Dixon J at 540.  
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, her Honour erred in holding that a defence under s 24 of the Code was not available to the applicant. In the present case, there was no evidence that the applicant's dogs had ever actually attacked a human, notwithstanding the fact that they, or at least some of them, had been permitted to roam the neighbourhood. The applicant denied that they had ever bitten anyone. The victim had been a frequent visitor to her garden, with no suggestion of her having had any concerns regarding the dogs. The evidence of the applicant was to the effect that he did not believe they presented a risk to anyone. The evidence upon which the Crown fundamentally relied was that of an expert, who drew upon his own background and training to say that the dogs presented a danger.  
        But it remains possible that a reasonable person might honestly have believed that they did not present a risk to humans 
        . In my opinion, therefore, this defence should have been left with the jury. I accept that the question of whether the dogs were such that, in the absence of care or precautions in their care or management, they might endanger the life, safety or health of a person is ""a state of things"" for the purpose of s 24. I do not accept that the operation of s 24 has been excluded by the implied provisions of s 266. This is not to say that a defence of mistake would necessarily have succeeded in this case. It was, however, a defence which the applicant was entitled to have the jury consider. I would accordingly allow this ground of appeal, with the consequence that the applicant's conviction must be quashed.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    88 Kennedy J cited from R v Lamb, including the passage earlier set out, but did not expressly apply that passage. His Honour did not refer to Jiminez v The Queen. There is, with respect, some tension in his Honour’s reasoning. The key to his conclusion appears to have been the emphasised words “that a reasonable person might honestly have believed that [the dogs] did not present a risk to humans”. If the reasonable person could have done so, the Crown failed to prove the requisite negligence. Section 24 of the Criminal Code postulated the applicant’s own belief, but his Honour’s conclusion turned on the reasonable person’s belief and was really concerned with proof of the prosecution case rather than the application of s 24. I do not think the case provides support for the appellant. 
     
      
    89 In my opinion, the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was not available to the appellant. Treating the request of counsel for the appellant as a request for a direction appropriate to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake, as was clearly enough understood, the judge did not err in declining to give the direction.  
     
      
       
      (b) Was there evidence raising the defence of honest and reasonable mistake? 
       
      
    90 In the light of what I have said, this does not arise. It is nonetheless appropriate to consider it, on the assumption that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was available. 
     
      
    91 I have referred to the judge’s observation that there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that the appellant “thought it was safe to drive into the bush”. Thinking that it was safe to drive into the bush was not the same as reasonably thinking that it was safe to drive into the bush. The Crown Prosecutor seems to have had that in mind when, following the judge’s indication that he considered that the evidence supported the holding of a positive believe as to safety to proceed, he responded to the effect that the evidence did not support the holding of a reasonable belief. The judge’s mind, however, was on whether there was room for the defence of honest and reasonable mistake, and his Honour did not develop his observation. 
     
      
    92 For the defence of honest and reasonable mistake it was necessary to identify a state of facts which, if true, would mean that the offence had not been committed. There had to be a basis for the appellant honestly and reasonably holding a belief in that state of facts. 
     
      
    93 In his appeal the appellant initially identified as the state of facts that it was safe to proceed. He referred to the observation in Jiminez v The Queen (at 583, part of the passage set out at [74] above) that an inference that the applicant believed it was safe to drive “might have been drawn by the jury from the very fact of his driving”. The appellant submitted that the mere fact that he drove the loader into the bush founded an inference that he believed it was safe to proceed. I do not agree that the fact that the appellant drove the loader into the bush of itself founded an inference that he believed it was safe to proceed. It was consistent with the appellant not thinking about safety at all and holding no belief as to safety to proceed. I do not think that Jiminez v The Queen supports inference from no more than driving to a belief as to safety in driving. The fact of driving was placed by their Honours in circumstances including reasonable prior sleep and no alcohol or drugs, and the “very fact of his driving” was in those circumstances.  
     
      
    94 In the present case, however, I consider that there was evidence going beyond driving the loader from which the jury could have inferred that the appellant believed that it was safe to proceed. It is sufficient to refer to the part of the recorded interviews set out in [24] above in which the appellant, when asked whether going through the scrub was dangerous, said, “Well the boys were a long way in front of me by then”. The appellant then accepted that he did not know where two of the boys were, which went to the reasonableness of his belief. But his answer could found an inference that he held a belief that it was safe to proceed, even if his thinking was inadequate and part of his lack of care. 
     
      
    95 However, I do not think that a belief that it was safe to proceed was a state of facts for the purposes of the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. 
     
      
    96 In McLuckie v Williams (1995) 82 A Crim R 118 the appellant, an ambulance driver, drove through a red light without using his siren. His ambulance was struck by another vehicle. He was charged with dangerous driving contrary to s 61(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1974 (WA), the offence being driving “in a manner … that is, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, dangerous to the public or to any person”. He relied on s 24 of the Criminal Code, which has been set out above. 
     
      
    97 Murray J said (at 126) - 
     
      
       
        
        “As was said in  
        Kaighin 
        , the test as to whether driving is dangerous is objective. It could not therefore be relevant to the potential application of s 24 of the Code that the defendant honestly, or honestly and reasonably, believed that his manner of driving was safe. That would not be a belief in a relevant state of things, but a subjective evaluation of the quality of the driving. As the High Court put it in Coventry (1938) 59 CLR 633 at 637: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The driver may have honestly believed that he was driving very carefully, and yet may be guilty of driving in a manner which is dangerous to the public. The jury is to determine, not whether the accused was in fact, as a matter of psychology, indifferent or not to the public safety, but whether he has driven in a manner which was dangerous to the public. The standard is an objective standard … ‘.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    98 His Honour went on to hold that the statutory defence of honest and reasonable mistake was not otherwise made out because the appellant’s (more specific) belief that no other vehicle was approaching the intersection could not have been reasonably held. 
     
      
    99 In Jiminez v The Queen their Honours spoke of a belief that it was safe for the applicant to drive. That related to the applicant’s condition, not to the carefulness of his driving, and was shorthand for whether he was affected by tiredness to an extent that his driving was objectively dangerous. Negligence does not make the offence of dangerous driving. It is at the heart of manslaughter by criminal negligence. But for both the standard is objective, in the one driving which was dangerous although the driver may have believed he was driving carefully and in the other conduct greatly falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable person would have exercised. The appellant’s belief that it was safe to proceed did not mean that it was safe to proceed or that he was acting with objectively reasonable care.  
     
      
    100 The appellant then identified as the state of facts that none of the boys was in the path of the loader. He relied principally on the part of the recorded interviews in which he answered that the boys were a long way in front of him, but also on parts of the interviews and other evidence to the effect that the loader was heavy and travelled slowly, that it was noisy, that the closest he thought he got to the boys was about 25 metres and the loader was not gaining on them. He also relied on the evidence that the boy who was with Michael Milne wanted to run away from the loader as it came through the scrub and began to do so, although there was nothing to suggest that he was aware of this. 
     
      
    101 The appellant had to believe in a state of facts other than the state of facts which existed. Much of what the appellant relied on represented the state of facts which existed, not some other state of facts which if they existed would make the appellant’s conduct innocent. That none of the boys was in the path of the loader could be a state of facts. The appellant’s answer that the boys were a long way in front of him must be read with his immediate acceptance that he did not know where two of the boys were, and does not provide a basis for belief that none of the boys was in the path of the loader. I doubt that, alone or together with the other parts of the records of interview and the other evidence, there was a basis for a belief in the appellant that none of the boys was in the path of the loader. He did not know where two of the boys were. He was chasing them in the loader. That they had been running away and the loader was noisy and fairly slow was hardly sufficient for a belief that they were out of the loader’s path. Whether or not that be correct, I do not think the evidence raised the holding by the appellant of a reasonable belief that none of the boys was in the path of the loader. What I have already said shows why.  
     
      
    102 The assumption that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was available becomes untenable as reasonableness of the appellant’s belief is addressed. At an evidentiary level, I consider that it was not incumbent on the judge to direct the jury that it was for the Crown to prove that the appellant did not hold an honest and reasonable belief that it was safe to proceed, or otherwise appropriately to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. 
     
      
       
      The further questions in the appellant’s appeal: relevance of the appellant’s belief 
       
      
    103 I have referred to two views of ground 2 and the two questions. The first was concerned with mens rea, and was whether it was necessary for the prosecution to prove a state of mind to which the appellant’s belief was relevant. The second was whether the belief of the appellant was relevant to whether the Crown had proved a high degree of negligence. 
     
      
       
      (a) Mens rea 
       
      
    104 I take the appellant to have submitted that the appellant’s belief was material because, quite apart from the defence of honest and reasonable mistake, it was for the prosecution to prove a state of mind as an element of the offence and the appellant’s belief went to that state of mind. 
     
      
    105 That had not been a matter with which the appellant’s counsel troubled the judge at the trial. As has been seen, an objective test was common ground. No objection was taken to the judge’s statement of the elements of the charge of manslaughter on the ground that the third element, “That such actions were deliberate”, was deficient and the prosecution had to prove some other state of mind in the appellant. The debate was as to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. After the summing-up the only matter relevantly raised, although in terms of the judge’s “comments in relation to the accused’s belief”, was specifically related to “the question that we discussed before” and “the question of the applicability of the honest and reasonable mistake which your Honour heard me on before the summing-up”. 
     
      
    106 The appellant did not in his appeal suggest a direction as to mens rea which should have been given. He did no more than assert error in directing the jury that his subjective belief was immaterial and did not matter. How it was material and mattered, and what direction should have been given, were left obscure.  
     
      
    107 It may be that leave pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be refused, an outcome to which the obscurity in the submissions could contribute. On the other hand, if a state of mind in the appellant was necessary to which his belief went, and the jury were not appropriately directed, the conviction should not be permitted to stand. 
     
      
    108 In Nydam v The Queen it was held that manslaughter by criminal negligence did not require mens rea, other than in the sense that there must be an intent to do the acts which constitute the offence. With a detailed discussion of the authorities, the Court considered that the negligence was to be measured objectively and that there was no requirement of mens rea involving “a consciousness on the part of the accused of the likelihood of his acts causing death or serious bodily harm to the victim or persons placed in a similar relationship as the victim was to the accused” (at 444). In a passage part of which has already been set out, the Court said that it was sufficient if the prosecution - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily, without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment.” (at 445) 
        
       
      
    109 Nydam v The Queen has generally been accepted in this State, and the judge’s directions to the jury were in accordance with it. The Crown submitted that it was approved in Wilson v The Queen at 333, but the approval was confined to the test of a high risk of death or grievous bodily harm as a different test of dangerousness from that required for manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. Wilson v The Queen was a case of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The unlawfulness required proof of whatever mens rea was necessary for the crime in question, but the dangerousness was assessed objectively and it was not necessary that the accused intended to commit a dangerous act (see at 325, 327, 334, 336; see also Director of Public Prosecutions v Newbury). It would not be consistent with that if, for a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence, consciousness of risk of death or grievous bodily harm was required, and to that extent Wilson v The Queen is supportive of Nydam v The Queen. 
     
      
    110 The appellant’s submission appeared to be no more than that the High Court’s decisions in He Kaw Teh v The Queen and Jiminez v The Queen cast doubt on Nydam v The Queen and that the decision of this Court in R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226 did the same. 
     
      
    111 Jiminez v The Queen has been earlier considered. In He Kaw Teh v The Queen it was held by majority that, for the offence under s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) of importing a prohibited import, the prosecution bore the onus of proving that the accused knew that he was importing a prohibited import. Gibbs CJ, with whom Mason J agreed, considered that the common law presumption that “full mens rea” (at 535) was required was not displaced. Brennan J also gave weight to a presumption in favour of mens rea, his Honour including in mens rea absence of honest and reasonable mistake (see at 582-3). Dawson J was less receptive to a presumption of mens rea in a statutory offence, while accepting a presumption in favour of the defence of honest and reasonable mistake (at 591).  
     
      
    112 In neither of these cases was manslaughter or Nydam v The Queen in question. The common law presumption in favour of mens rea “is liable to be displaced either by the words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject-matter with which it deals” (Sherras v De Rutzen (1895) 1 QB 918 at 921, adopted in He Kaw Teh v The Queen at 529, 566). I do not think He Kaw Teh v The Queen or Jiminez v The Queen cast doubt on Nydam v The Queen. 
     
      
    113 R v Taktak was a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence. The Crown case was that the accused should have obtained medical treatment for the deceased when the deceased had taken an overdose of drugs, but failed to do so. One ground of appeal was that the trial judge “erred in following Nydam v The Queen … “ (at 236); another was that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. Yeldham J upheld the latter ground, saying (at 247) that a finding that the accused was criminally negligent could not be supported and that “mere negligence or mere inadvertence is not enough”. His Honour did not address the former ground or refer to Nydam v The Queen. Carruthers and Loveday JJ relevantly agreed with Yeldham J, and in the course of his additional remarks Carruthers J stated the elements of the offence in terms taken from, and with citation of, Nydam v The Queen. 
     
      
    114 The appellant relied on the citation by Yeldham J of a passage from R v Stone (1977) 1 QB 354, which should be seen in its context (at 247) - 
     
      
       
        
        “But in any event, whether the likely time of death be as Dr Brighton said, or whether Dr d'Souza's evidence, which is the subject of challenge, is to be preferred, I am of the view that any conclusion that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter, having regard to the high degree of negligence required, should be set aside as being unsafe and unsatisfactory. I mention but few of the authorities. In  
        R v Nicholls 
         Brett J (at 76) told the jury that a grown up person who chooses to undertake the charge of a human creature who is helpless is bound to execute that charge ""without (at all events) wicked negligence ... Mere negligence will not do, there must be wicked negligence, that is, negligence so great, that you must be of the opinion that the prisoner had a wicked mind, in the sense that she was reckless and careless whether the creature died or not"". In  
        R v Bonnyman 
         (1942) 86 Sol Jo 274; 28 Cr App R 131, the Lord Chief Justice, after referring to  
        R v Bateman 
         [1925] All ER Rep 45; (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 and to Andrews reiterated the need for ""a very high degree of negligence"" to be proved before the felony of manslaughter is established. In  
        R v Stone & Dobinson 
         it was said that ""... it is to  
        Andrews v Director of Public Prosecutions  
        ... that one must turn to discover the definition of the requisite degree of negligence"". At 363 reference is made to the words of Lord Hewart CJ in  
        R v Bateman 
         which were quoted with approval by Lord Atkin in  
        Andrews 
         (at 582). In  
        R v Stone & Dobinson 
         it is said that: 
         
         
          
          ‘It is clear from that passage that indifference to an obvious risk, and appreciation of such risk, coupled with a determination nevertheless to run it, are both examples of recklessness ... What the prosecution have to prove is a breach of that duty in such circumstances that the jury feel convinced that the defendant's conduct could properly be described as reckless, that is to say a reckless disregard of danger to the health and welfare of the infirm person. Mere inadvertence is not enough. The defendant must be proved to have been indifferent to an obvious risk of injury to health, or actually to have foreseen the risk but to have determined nevertheless to run it.’: see also  
          R v Holzer 
           [1968] VR 481.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In the present case, although it is clear that a doctor should have been called to the deceased at an early stage, and that (assuming she was then alive) if he had given her the appropriate treatment, she may well not have died, I consider that a finding that the appellant was criminally negligent cannot be supported. Mere negligence or mere inadvertence is not enough.” 
        
       
      
    115 The appellant’s submission must have been that the reference to recklessness in determination to run a foreseen risk endorsed a necessary state of mind beyond that thought sufficient in Nydam v The Queen.  
     
      
    116 The high degree of negligence required for the present category of manslaughter has on occasions been described as recklessness. The language can mislead. Recklessness can mean acting negligently unaware of the risk of death or grievous bodily harm, or acting despite awareness of the risk of death or grievous bodily harm. If there is reckless indifference to human life, the offence is murder (Crimes Act, s 18(1)(a)). Hence in Nydam v The Queen the Court sought to distinguish between murder by recklessness and manslaughter by criminal negligence (at 444-5), and arrived at the statement of the latter earlier set out. R v Holzer (1968) VR 481, which had required for manslaughter recklessness in the sense of realisation of a risk of serious bodily injury, was disapproved. 
     
      
    117 In England the ambiguity of recklessness as spoken of in Andrews v Director of Public Prosecutions (1937) AC 576 led to a number of cases in which reckless manslaughter, involving acting despite awareness of the dangerousness, was recognised. As I have said, R v Lamb was an instance of importation of recklessness into manslaughter. The place of recklessness was reconsidered in The Queen v Adomako (1995) 1 AC 171, in which the use of “reckless” was accepted “in the ordinary connotation of that word” (at 187), as a use to indicate “the extent to which a defendant’s conduct must deviate from that of a proper standard of care” (at 189). R v Stone was described as a use of the word in that ordinary connotation (at 187). Despite the label of ordinary use of the word, recklessness became a statement of severe departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person.  
     
      
    118 R v Stone was an example of recognition of reckless manslaughter. It was ambivalent, referring also to indifference to risk as distinct from appreciation of risk. So far as it referred to determination to run a foreseen risk, that was a sufficient but not necessary state of mind, and as a necessary state of mind could not stand with Nydam v The Queen. It is scarcely conceivable that Yeldham J was unaware of the import of Nydam v The Queen, and intended so casually to depart from it and to reinstate R v Holzer. Nor can Carruthers J have believed that that was entailed in his agreement. In my opinion, Yeldham J was not concerned with the accused’s consciousness of risk or of his negligence. His Honour was concerned with the necessary degree of negligence, being more than mere negligence or mere inadvertence, and cited R v Stone, together with other cases, in that connection. This anticipated its interpretation as a case of recklessness in deviation from the proper standard of care. I do not think that R v Taktak calls for departure from the acceptance in this State of Nydam v The Queen. 
     
      
    119 The Crown case against the appellant was not one of recklessness in negligently exposing the boys to a foreseen risk. It was expressly that a reasonable person in the appellant’s position would or ought to have realised that he was creating a high risk that serious injury or death would follow his actions. No reason has been shown for the judge departing from Nydam v The Queen and directing the jury that the prosecution had to prove that the appellant had a state of mind beyond an intention to do the acts which constituted the offence. To repeat, the appellant did not say how his subjective belief was material and mattered. Assuming he meant that it was necessary for the Crown to prove that he did not believe that it was safe to proceed, as the context would suggest, I do not think that it was necessary, and the Crown case did not make his belief relevant. 
     
      
    120 Since writing the foregoing I have read the reasons of Hulme and Adams JJ in draft. Their Honours have gone far beyond the appellant’s submissions as to mens rea.  
     
      
    121 Adams J considers that it is necessary that the accused realised that there was an appreciable risk of death or grievous bodily harm and continued despite it. His Honour sees realisation and continuance as providing the “moral turpitude” involved in departure from an objective standard of care deserving criminal punishment. I respectfully suggest that appreciation of risk is not necessary for a sufficiently great falling short of the objective standard of care, and that the law would be deficient if grossly negligent conduct causing death could not bring criminal punishment unless the accused foresaw the danger. Hulme J considers that it is not necessary that there be awareness of risk or indifference to consequences. His Honour’s discussion of the cases confirms my conclusion that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove that the appellant did not believe that it was safe to proceed. 
     
      
       
      (b) Extent of negligence 
       
      
    122 The appellant submitted that his belief was material because the jury could “consider the question of the appellant’s belief in a practical way as being a factor to take into account when determining the question of whether his acts amounted to ‘criminal’ or ‘gross’ negligence”.  
     
      
    123 At the trial counsel for the appellant did not invite the jury to use a belief that it was safe to drive the loader as a litmus test for objective reasonableness. Counsel addressed on a defence of honest and reasonable mistake. Nor did counsel ask the judge to direct the jury that the appellant’s belief was a factor to be taken into account when determining whether he was negligent or in determining the extent of his negligence. Counsel asked for a direction as to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake.  
     
      
    124 As I have indicated, the unfortunate way in which the defence arose placed the judge in a difficult position. It was necessary for him to make clear to the jury, having ruled that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was not available, that the defence and as part of that defence the appellant’s belief as introduced in the address of the appellant’s counsel were not a matter for their consideration. In their context, the judge’s words were directed to that, and to reinforcing that the appellant’s negligence was to be assessed objectively. They would have been understood by the jury in that way, and there was otherwise no issue presented for the jury as to taking the appellant’s belief into account in determining the quality of the departure from the standard of care. Even if there had been error in failing to direct the jury to take the appellant’s belief into account in the manner now suggested, I consider that leave pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be refused.  
     
      
    125 In any event, I do not think that the direction was required.  
     
      
    126 The appellant relied on R v Lamb for relevance of the appellant’s state of mind, specifically whether he thought that what he was doing was safe, to proof of lack of care. I have already referred to the intrusion of recklessness into the Court’s reasoning. Mens rea in the form of consciousness of risk of death or grievous bodily harm was not required, as I have concluded, and the appellant’s belief as to whether it was safe to proceed was not relevant to that proof. 
     
      
    127 I repeat part of Lush J’s observations in R v Taylor, when he said of R v Lamb (see para [70] above) - 
     
      
       
        
        “The final sentence quoted from the judgment of Sachs LJ may, if I may say so with respect, be accepted as a statement that in inquiring whether a reasonable man would have realised that the act was dangerous, the jury would have been entitled to consider, and in the circumstances should have been directed to consider, whether a reasonable man might have entertained the mistaken belief held by the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        All that the applicant was entitled to in the present case was a direction that, in deciding whether or not a reasonable man in all the circumstances would have regarded the administration of a large dose of Noctec as dangerous, they should regard as among the circumstances which were to be taken into account and in which the hypothetical reasonable man was to be placed the facts that the doctors had given the prescriptions and the advice as to dosage to which I have referred.” 
        
       
      
    128 The mistaken belief held by the accused to which his Honour referred in the first paragraph must have been his belief that the revolver would not fire, he being unaware that pulling the trigger would bring a bullet into the firing position opposite the barrel. It was not the more generalised belief that whatever he was doing was safe, as is shown by his Honour’s following paragraph.  
     
      
    129 In assessing the lack of care the standard was that of a reasonable person in the position of the appellant. The position of the appellant included what he saw and did not see as he drove the loader, amongst other things the evidence that the boys were a long way in front of him as qualified by not knowing where two of the boys were and the other evidence about the loader being slow and noisy. It was no part of the Crown case that the position of the appellant included that he thought that what he was doing was dangerous, as a matter going to departure from the standard of care or the quality of that departure, and the appellant’s belief had no place in assessing the lack of care. As was pointed out in McLuckie v Williams, see para [97] above, the belief is the accused’s subjective evaluation. It is not part of an objective evaluation of the accused’s conduct. 
     
      
    130 Only if the appellant’s conduct was first judged reasonable could his belief in its reasonableness add anything, but that was what was in issue. Directing the jury to take the appellant’s belief into account could only bring confusion. A belief that it was not safe to proceed did not contribute to proof of the offence on the objective standard of the care a reasonable person would have exercised. A belief that it was safe to proceed did not provide exculpation. 
     
      
    131 Hulme J is of the view that the direction that it was “immaterial in this case … what the accused believed to be the case at the time” was erroneous, because the jury should have taken into account any beliefs the appellant had as to primary factual matters: he identifies an arguably relevant belief that the boys were not in the path of the loader. In this respect his Honour attributes more to the appellant’s ground of appeal than did the appellant. As I have indicated, the judge’s words would have been understood as directed to the belief as introduced in the address of the appellant’s counsel, the belief that it was safe to proceed. The belief that none of the boys was in the path of the loader was not stated by the appellant, but was a construct of facts such as that the boys were a long way in front of the loader, the loader was noisy and travelled slowly and the appellant had seen (two of) the boys a long way in front of him. Those facts were part of the appellant’s knowledge attributed to the reasonable person, and the directions sufficiently instructed the jury to have regard to them. 
     
      
    132 Thus the directions earlier set out included that the appellant’s conduct was to be compared “with the conduct of a reasonable person who possesses the same personal attributes as the accused, that is to say a person of the same age, having the same experience and knowledge as the accused in the circumstances in which he found himself … “, and that the jury were to put themselves “in the position of a reasonable person in the position of the accused, same age, knowing what he knows … “. The judge’s summary of the defence case as to the extent of negligence included, in the appellant’s favour using the expression “safe to proceed” - 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Hamill says that you have got to put this in perspective, that this loader was large and noisy, it could have been readily seen and heard, there was nothing to suggest that these boys were other than fit, that it was only going at four to five k’s an hour and that any reasonable person in the position of the accused would have expected that it was safe to proceed in that there was no reason why these boys simply could not have avoided it either by running away or stepping to the side or whatever.” 
        
       
       
      Section 18(2) of the Crimes Act 
       
      
    133 Section 18 of the Crimes Act has been set out. The appellant submitted that s 18(2)(a) qualified the lack of care in the common law offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence, so far as it provided that “[n]o act or omission which was not malicious … shall be within this section”. Section 5 of the Crimes Act provides - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Maliciously 
        : Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime.” 
        
       
      
    134 The appellant submitted both that s 18(2)(a) “preserved” the defence of honest and reasonable mistake, and that it imported malice into the offence so that “the absence of malice in conduct causing death will take that conduct outside the scope of the crime of manslaughter”. 
     
      
    135 There is little authority on s 18(2). The submissions were scanty, and did not endeavour to place s 18(2) in a historical context or to analyse to any extent why it had or did not have either of the consequences for which the appellant contended. 
     
      
    136 Murder as defined in s 18(1)(a) is clearly enough subject to s 18(2)(a), the acts or omissions there referred to being “within this section”. The relationship between s 18(1)(a) and s 18(2) has caused difficulty, see Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 and Royall v The Queen (1990) 172 CLR 378, in the latter of which it was noted (at 429) that as to that offence s 18(2) has effectively been disregarded in this State. 
     
      
    137 The relationship between s 18(1)(b) and s 18(2) is no less difficult, and the disregard of s 18(2) appears to have extended to manslaughter, at least since R v Harvey (1887) 8 NSWR 39 and R v Sadler (1900) 21 NSWR 380 as to its predecessor. The first question is whether s 18(2)(a) qualifies the common law offences which are referred to, but not defined or made statutory offences, in s 18(1)(b). If it does, the second question is what effect it has on proof or defence in relation to that offence. 
     
      
    138 In Royall v The Queen Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (at 429-30) - 
     
      
       
        
        “In this regard it should be kept in mind that, while s 18(1)(a) defines the offence of murder, par(b) does not define the offence of manslaughter. It provides: ‘Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter’, thereby making it necessary to resort to the common law to determine what constitutes a ‘punishable homicide’ other than murder. On the face of the section, a homicide, punishable at common law, is no longer punishable if the act or omission constituting the homicide (be it murder or manslaughter) was not malicious or was an act or omission for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse. Section 18 thus emerges as a rather unsatisfactory mix of statutory definition coupled with retention of the common law, the operation of which is at the same time qualified by the terms of the section.” 
        
       
      
    139 On one view the acts or omissions constituting a punishable homicide other than murder are “within this section”, although only because s 18(1)(b) takes up the excepted common law offences and ascribes to them the label of manslaughter. On another view the words “within this section” do not go that far. The Crown’s submissions did not dispute that s 18(2)(a) applies to the common law offences falling within s 18(1)(b), as Toohey and Gaudron JJ seem to have accepted. I proceed on that basis. 
     
      
    140 On its face, s 18(2)(a) means that the acts or omissions constituting manslaughter by criminal negligence must be malicious, the meaning of malicious coming from the definition of “maliciously”. In Royall v The Queen Toohey and Gaudron JJ posed whether s 18(2) “operate[d] as a defence, with the onus cast on the accused to bring himself or herself within the subsection”, or whether “absence of malice [was] a factor which the Crown must prove as part of its case”. Their Honours said that “[t]he construction of s 18 tends to suggest the former” (at 428-9). This must have looked beyond malice, to lawful cause or excuse and perhaps killing by misfortune. Neither the appellant nor the Crown addressed any submissions to this. I do not think that it matters in the present case. 
     
      
    141 In R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 Hunt J said (at 472) that “it should be stated (yet again) that the definition of ‘maliciously’ in s 5 is not a happily drafted one”. It does not merely restate the common law (ibid at 474), and must be construed in the normal way. In R v Safwan (1986) 8 NSWLR 97 at 101-2 there was reference to the need to “edit” the definition to the words within it appropriate to the case in order to avoid confusion in the summing-up. If it be needed, this underlines that the definition is multi-faceted. 
     
      
    142 Let it be asked whether the Crown has proved malice, or the accused has raised absence of malice. The Crown must prove that the accused’s acts were done , or the accused must raise that his acts were not done – 
     
      
       
        
        (a) “of malice”; 
         
        (b) “without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering”; 
         
        (c) “with intent to injure … and without lawful cause or excuse“; or 
         
        (d) “recklessly or wantonly”. 
        
       
      
    143 None of this is proof of or raising an honest or reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if true, would make the accused’s acts or omissions innocent. Whatever s 18(2)(a) addresses, it is not the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. 
     
      
    144 Alternative (b), “without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering”, plainly means something different from alternative (a) and must mean something different from alternatives (c) and (d). It must be satisfied by something less than recklessness, as is confirmed by the contrast with “reckless indifference to human life” in s 18(1)(a). The indifference goes beyond acting despite awareness of a risk to human life or of suffering, and must encompass indifference to human life or suffering in the sense of being unaware of a risk to human life or of suffering when it would be grossly negligent not to recognise the risk. 
     
      
    145 In my opinion, s18(2)(a) does not require more in manslaughter by criminal negligence than the high degree of negligence to which I have earlier referred; it does not require that the Crown prove consciousness of risk of death or grievous bodily harm, initially or upon the accused raising its absence. 
     
      
    146 Hulme J is of the view that the summing-up was deficient because the jury was not directed to consider whether, in accordance with s 18(2)(a), the appellant acted with indifference to human life or suffering, recklessly or wantonly. I respectfully do not think that it was necessary that the jury be so directed (and the judge was not asked to so direct the jury). If s 18(2)(a) means that the acts or omissions constituting manslaughter by criminal negligence must be malicious, it could hardly require a direction that the acts or omissions be (for example) with intent to injure. The directions must sufficiently embody the aspect of the definition of “maliciously” appropriate to the offence. In a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence that is indifference to human life or suffering, understood as I have explained above, and s 18(2)(a) is satisfied by directions having the effect that indifference to human life and suffering is required. Directions in accordance with Nydam v The Queen, with their need for a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised in the face of a high risk of death or grievous bodily harm, are more than sufficient. It is not necessary to use the words of s 18(2)(a) if the directions encompass their effect, and that may well be why the view taken by Hulme J has not previously come to prominence. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    147 Hulme and Adams JJ point out that directions in accordance with Nydam v The Queen should be so framed that whether the accused’s actions merit criminal punishment is directed to the two elements of falling short of a reasonable person’s standard of care and a high risk of death or really serious bodily harm. I agree. Adams J suggests that the judge’s directions were deficient in their reference to a duty of care, in inadequately requiring grave moral guilt, and in other respects involving fortitude and strength of mind and right-thinking. None of these was raised by the grounds of appeal or was the subject of submissions. I respectfully do not think that the appeal can be determined by regard to them, and prefer not to venture any comment. 
     
      
    148 There is divergence in our reasons, not for want of communication. For trial judges, there can be found the following propositions - 
     
      
      (a) in cases of manslaughter by criminal negligence juries should be directed in accordance with  
      Nydam v The Queen 
      ; 
       
      (b) juries should also be directed in terms of the expression or expressions in the definition of “maliciously” in s 5 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       appropriate to the facts;  
       
      (c) evidence of the accused’s belief in primary factual matters is relevant; and 
       
      (d) there is no separate defence of honest and reasonable mistake. 
       
       
      The Crown appeal 
       
      
    149 The Crown submitted that both the sentence imposed and the non-parole period were manifestly inadequate. It was said that the sentence did not adequately reflect the objective criminality of the offence, and that too little weight had been given to the seriousness of the offence and too great weight to subjective matters in the appellant’s favour. It was accepted that a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was justified, but it was submitted that the non-parole period was too short. 
     
      
    150 The Crown correctly drew attention to two considerations. One was that the taking of a human life, by manslaughter as by any other offence, is regarded in the community and under law as a most serious matter. The other was that the circumstances giving rise to a conviction for manslaughter can vary greatly, and culpability can correspondingly vary greatly, so that, while the starting-point is the gravity of the taking of a human life, the range of available sentences is very wide. It is sufficient to refer to cases such as R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 and R v Blacklidge (CCA, 12 December 1995, unreported). 
     
      
    151 The subjective matters in the appellant’s favour were impressive. He was forty-five years old when he was sentenced. He had some minor traffic infringements but no relevant criminal history. The judge accepted that he was a person of excellent character who until the events of 2 October 2001 could only be described as a model citizen. He had been greatly affected by what had occurred and was genuinely remorseful. In R v Musumeci (CCA, 30 October 1997, unreported), a case of dangerous driving occasioning death, it was said that courts “must tread warily in showing leniency for good character”. This was taken up in R v Do [2000] NSWCCA 459 at [14], a case of manslaughter by criminal negligence. The appellant was nonetheless entitled to the benefit of the subjective matters. 
     
      
    152 The gravamen of the Crown appeal lay in observations by the judge in his remarks on sentence as to abandonment by the appellant of responsibility for his actions.  
     
      
    153 After recounting the facts the judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        The overwhelming inference is that at no time did the offender turn his mind to where the two boys were who remained unsighted, one of them being Michael Milne. At no stage was he in a position to see them because of the lack of visibility to which I have referred. Significantly, the offender conceded to police that his area of work did not include the scrub to which I have referred and that he had only driven into the scrub to chase the boys and scare them off. He referred to there having been vandalism at the site on previous occasions. I should say at this point that there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that Michael Milne or his companions were responsible for this. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view, it is unnecessary to refer to the evidence in this matter in any further detail. The stark reality is that the offender embarked upon a course of action which was criminally negligent. The learned Crown Prosecutor in his address to the jury described it as a brain snap and maybe this is close to the truth. However, the reality also is that any reasonable person in the position of the offender would have and must have realised that from the moment he entered the scrub in pursuit of these boys, the danger of serious injury or death was high. His visibility was poor and no doubt at times non existent. Whilst the Crown conceded that the offender was driving his loader at a very low speed, maybe as low as four kilometres per hour, he in effect drove blind. Whilst there can be no doubt that the offender did not have any intention to injure these boys, he simply did not direct his mind to what was an obvious risk. The inference is that he assumed that because he was driving a very large vehicle which was readily visible and very noisy at a very slow speed, that the boys would have been able to readily avoid him. This was an assumption that no person in his position was entitled to make and the horrific consequences of this mistaken assumption were realised on this occasion. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst the offender’s actions might well be categorised as a result of a brain snap as referred to by the learned Crown Prosecutor, they could not be said to amount to any momentary inattention or inadvertence on his part. The fact is that he drove a very heavy vehicle, albeit at a slow speed, through an area of scrub in pursuit of young children in circumstances where his vision was significantly and sometimes totally obscured by the vegetation in the area and the configuration of the vehicle that he was driving. He did this for some one hundred and forty-odd metres, coming so close to at least one of the children that that child could have touched the vehicle. Not only did he then return to the area of scrub but, having seen two of the four children, he diverged from his course to follow them in circumstances where he had absolutely no idea where the other two children, one of whom was Michael Milne, were. As a result he came into contact with Michael Milne who died as a result. From the time that the offender first entered the scrub in pursuit of Michael Milne and his friends, in my view, he completely abandoned responsibility for his actions and their obvious possible consequences. The verdict of the jury in my view leads to this inescapable conclusion.” 
        
       
      
    154 The judge later said that “the last thing on [the appellant’s] mind that day would be the possibility that by his actions he would occasion the death of a child,” but reiterated - 
     
      
       
        
        “Nonetheless, the reality is as I said earlier that from the time the offender took the loader into the scrub in pursuit of the deceased and his friends, whatever the motive, in my view he completely abandoned responsibility and the dire consequences which ensued must have been well within the contemplation of any reasonable person in his position.” 
        
       
      
    155 Later again the judge said that he agreed with the Crown’s submissions to the effect that the appellant deliberately drove through the scrub in pursuit of the boys, that it was not a case of momentary inattention, and that the appellant had “completely abandoned responsibility for his actions” and “abandoned all responsibility at that point”. His Honour continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned Crown Prosecutor conceded that the Court would be entitled to find that the offender had an honest belief at all stages that it was safe to do what he did, presumably because he thought that the fact that his vehicle was large and noisy and slow the children would easily be able to avoid it. But, the learned Crown, said in reality, that the offender should have been loudly and clearly aware of the danger of what he did, particularly in the light of the unpredictable behaviour of children. Again I agree with this submission.” 
        
       
      
    156 The Crown fastened upon the judge’s acceptance that there was not momentary inattention, but an abandonment of responsibility. It was submitted that the appellant’s culpability was therefore high, and all the higher because all the boys were put at risk and because of the gravity of the risk and its realisation in the death of Michael Milne. The culpability was such, it was said, that there was manifest inadequacy in the sentence. 
     
      
    157 There was not momentary inattention, but a course of conduct engaged in through lack of care is not necessarily of higher culpability than an isolated act. If, as the judge said was conceded, the appellant honestly believed that it was safe to do what he did, and believed that the loader was large, noisy and slow so that the boys could easily avoid it, that bore upon the culpability of his course of conduct. The judge’s references to abandonment of responsibility are understandable, but must be read subject to the acceptance of the appellant’s honest belief.  
     
      
    158 Objectively, the appellant’s conduct was wholly irresponsible. But it was not a case of conduct regardless of whether it was safe. Rather, his conduct was in the honest but negligently formed belief that it was safe. The judge’s remarks on sentence must be read as a whole. I do not think that manifest inadequacy has been shown, whether as to the sentence or the non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      The result 
       
      
    159 In my opinion, the appellant’s appeal and the Crown appeal should both be dismissed. 
     
      
    160 HULME J: The circumstances which have led to the Appellant’s conviction and this appeal are set out in the reasons for judgment of Giles JA which I have had the advantage of reading. Accordingly I can proceed immediately to the issues which arise.  
     
      
       
      The Common Law Test for Liability in Manslaughter by Criminal Negligence 
      
    161 I do not, by choice of heading, pre-judge the issue for determination. The expression “manslaughter by criminal negligence” is time honoured. 
     
      
    162 The written directions on the topic of manslaughter given to the jury were in terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown must prove to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt ALL of the following:- 
         
         
        1. That on 2 October 2001 the accused had a duty of care to Michael Milne.  
        
       
       
        
        2. That the accused was negligent in that by his actions that day he was in breach of that duty of care. 
        
       
       
        
        3. That such actions were deliberate. 
        
       
       
        
        4. That such actions of the accused caused the death of Michael Milne. 
        
       
       
        
        5. That such actions: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) Fell so far short of the standard of care which a reasonable person would have expected in the circumstances; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) Involved such a high risk that death or really serious bodily harm would follow that the actions merit criminal punishment.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    163 Subject to one matter arising out of the manner of formulation of paragraph 5 and to which I will come, his Honour’s oral directions followed these written directions.  
     
      
    164 The words in paragraph 5 follow virtually word for word the suggested directions in the Judges’ Bench Book and echo those of Young CJ, McInerney and Crockett JJ in Nydham v R [1977] VR 430 at 445 where, after an extensive review of authority, it was said:-  
     
      
       
        
        “In order to establish manslaughter by criminal negligence, it is sufficient if the prosecution shows that the act which caused the death was done by the accused consciously and voluntarily, without any intention of causing death or grievous bodily harm but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death or grievous bodily harm would follow that the doing of the act merited criminal punishment.” 
        
       
      
    165 So stated, the test of liability, culpability or fault for a conscious, voluntary act is purely objective. That is not to say, of course, that there is not an element of judgment involved in any determination of whether, on the facts of a particular case, the test has been met. 
     
      
    166 Before proceeding further I should say that the manner in which paragraph 5 of the written directions is set out, even if the words are otherwise correct, is unfortunate. The test set forth in Nydam v R for determining whether an accused’s actions merit criminal punishment is a composite one and comprises two elements. The words “that the actions merit criminal punishment” should not have been included in subparagraph (ii) which deals with only one of those elements but as part of the body, albeit at the end of, paragraph 5. The Bench Book needs correcting in this regard. However, in his oral directions the trial judge stated the test in the composite form on at least 4 occasions and on at least 2 others emphasized that the negligence had to be so great as to be judged criminal or a crime. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the error in the written directions did not appreciably disadvantage the Appellant.  
     
      
    167 It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that Nydam v R was wrong and inconsistent with the decision of this court in R v Taktak (1988) 14 NSWLR 226. In that case the gravamen of the charge was that the appellant had taken to some premises and put to bed an apparently sick and unconscious 15 year old heroin addict without then seeking medical attention for her. In quashing a conviction, Yeldham J said (at 247):- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am of the view that any conclusion that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter, having regard to the high degree of negligence required, should be set aside as being unsafe and unsatisfactory. I mention but few of the authorities. In  
        R v Nicholls  
        [1874] 13 Cox CC 75, Brett J (at 76) told the jury that a grown up person who chooses to undertake the charge of a human creature who is helpless is bound to execute that charge ‘without (at all events)  
        wicked  
        negligence… Mere negligence will not do, there must be wicked negligence, that is, negligence so great, that you must be of the opinion that the prisoner had a wicked mind, in the sense that she was reckless and careless whether the creature died or not’. In  
        R v Bonnyman  
        (1942) 86 Sol Jo 274; 28 Cr App R 131, the Lord Chief Justice, after referring to  
        R v Bateman  
        [1925] All ER Rep 45; (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 and to  
        Andrews 
         reiterated the need for a ‘very high degree of negligence’ to be proved before the felony of manslaughter is established. In  
        R v Stone & Dobinson  
        it was said that ‘… it is to  
        Andrews v DPP 
        … that one must turn to discover the definition of the requisite degree of negligence’. At 363 reference is made to the words of Lord Hewart CJ in  
        R v Bateman  
        which were quoted with approval by Lord Atkin in Andrews (at 582). In  
        R v Stone & Dobinson  
        it is said that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “It is clear from that passage that indifference to an obvious risk, and appreciation of such risk, coupled with a determination nevertheless to run it, are both examples of recklessness … What the Prosecution have to prove is a breach of that duty in such circumstances that the jury feel convinced that the defendant’s conduct could properly be described as reckless, that is to say a reckless disregard of danger to the health and welfare of the infirm person. Mere inadvertence is not enough. The defendant must be proved to have been indifferent to an obvious risk of injury to health, or actually to have foreseen the risk but to have determined nevertheless to run it:” See also  
          R v Holzer  
          [1968] VR 481. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In the present case, although it is clear that a doctor should have been called to the deceased at an early stage, and that (assuming she was then alive) if he had given her the appropriate treatment, she may well not have died, I consider that a finding that the appellant was criminally negligence cannot be supported. Mere negligence or mere inadvertence is not enough.” 
        
       
      
    168 In R v Taktak, Yeldham J did not refer to the decision in Nydam v R. Loveday J simply agreed with Yeldham J’s reasons. The third member of the court Carruthers J said (at p250):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence with which the appellant was charged may conveniently be referred to as manslaughter by criminal negligence. Thus it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) That the appellant owed a duty of care in law to Miss Kirby. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) That it was the omission of the appellant to obtain medical treatment which was the proximate cause of Miss Kirby’s death 
        
       
       
        
        (3) That such omission by the appellant was conscious and voluntary, without any intention of causing death but in circumstances which involved such a great falling short of the standard of care which a reasonable man would have exercised and which involved such a high risk that death would follow that the omission merited criminal punishment.

    169 His Honour went on to say that, with a reservation not presently relevant, he generally agreed with the judgment of Yeldham J. His Honour did not advert to what Adams J and I see as an irreconcilable difference between the approach of the Court in Nydam v R and that of Yeldham J. The latter’s apparent acceptance of the law as set forth in R v Holzer, and of the proposition that “the defendant must be proved to have been indifferent to an obvious risk of injury to health, or actually seen the risk but to have determined nevertheless to run it” and, depending on what meaning one gives to the words “reckless” and “careless” of the proposition that a jury “must be of the opinion that the prisoner had a wicked mind, in the sense that she was reckless and careless whether the creature died or not” is to endorse an approach quite different from the objective one laid down in Nydam v R. 
     
      
    170 A choice must be made between these approaches. In that connection it is relevant to bear in mind that Nydam v R was a decision of the Victorian Full Court while R v Taktak was a decision of this Court. More important, however, is the fact that reference to other authority, including authority in this State and in the High Court, shows that Yeldham J’s approach, at least so far as the common law is concerned, was wrong. 
     
      
    171 But before turning to that authority I may say that it seems to me clear that much confusion in this area has arisen because of the width of meaning which “reckless” and its derivates may bear and, if not looseness in expression, differences in understanding or the meaning given to those words. 
     
      
    172 The Oxford English Dictionary defines reckless as “to neglect; to be negligent or heedless of (a thing)”. “Recklessly” is defined variously as “in a reckless manner”, “carelessly, negligently”, “without regard to consequences, rashly” and “through carelessness; accidentally”. “Recklessness” is defined as “the quality of being reckless” and “neglect or disregard (of something)”. 
     
      
    173 This breadth of meaning extending from carelessness or negligence on the one hand to indifference to or “without regard to consequences” is important to bear in mind whenever the term is used in the passages to which I refer below. 
     
      
    174 The imprecision in the term was adverted to by Barwick CJ in Pemble v R  (1971) 124 CLR at 119-121. It is unnecessary to quote from those remarks but, because they are relevant both here and as to the test to be applied in cases such as this, it is appropriate to refer to some remarks of Windeyer J in R v Phillips (1971) 45 ALJR 467 where the same point is made. In that case the offender had been convicted of murder under the provisions of the Tasmanian Criminal Code. An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania had been allowed and a new trial ordered. The High Court dismissed an appeal by the Crown seeking to have the conviction restored, the majority taking the view that on a retrial a conviction for murder or manslaughter was open. At page 478 Windeyer J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “At this point I should add that when he was directing the jury on the basis that it was open to them to find that death was caused by an omission within the purview of s56(2)(b) “amounting to culpable negligence”, his Honour told them that culpable negligence was conduct that was “utterly reckless not merely negligent”. Some criticisms were made of this. If the question were one of manslaughter by criminal negligence according to the common law, then the words his Honour used could not I think be said to be erroneous, although they might be said to be inadequate. The word reckless has often been used, in this Court and elsewhere, to describe negligent conduct of such a degree that it is felonious: Lord Atkin in  
        Andrews v DPP 
         [1937] AC 576, at p583, said: ”Probably of all the epithets that can be applied, “reckless” most nearly covers the case”. Reckless negligence can thus be a conventional and convenient description of negligence of an aggravated and criminal kind.” 
        
       
      
    175 Windeyer J then referred to McCarthy v R and Callaghan v R, to which reference is made below, and continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In the judgment of this Court in the last mentioned case it was said (at p123) that “in order that homicide by omission may be criminal, the omission must amount to what is sometimes called gross, and sometimes culpable negligence”. In explaining this to a jury it seems to me that, although the word reckless would not be out of place, it might be better avoided. “Reckless” and “rash” have been commonplaces of English speech for centuries, at least since Shakespeare’s day. Today “reckless” is often used, with little attention to its etymology, to describe a quality of actions rather than a mental attribute of the actor. But in recent times textbook writers on jurisprudence and criminal law have urged that, for legal purposes, a man is only properly to be called reckless when he was aware of the probability of harmful consequences of his conduct, but nevertheless pursued it. Recklessness, it is said, involves consciously disregarding consequences, as when the New South Wales Crimes Act, 1900, s18, speaks of an act “done with reckless indifference to human life”. An illustration from another field is when a statement is said to have been made with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. But despite the efforts of learned lawyers who engage in lexicography of their own devising, the word itself remains imprecise in ordinary parlance.” 
        
       
      
    176 His Honour went on to refer to the remarks of Barwick CJ in Pemble v R which I have mentioned. 
     
      
    177 The doubts of these 2 members of the High Court were not shared by Lord Hailsham in R v Lawrence [1982] AC 510 who said (at p520) that the word had been ‘in general use at least since the 8th century AD almost always with the same meaning”. There is a degree of inconsistency between his Lordship’s certainty and the indications in Lord Diplock’s speech, in which the other Lords agreed, that it was desirable to explain the term to a jury. The slightly earlier case of R v Caldwell [1982] AC 341, in which Lord Diplock also gave the leading judgment, and notwithstanding his Lordship’s definition of the term, provides a clear indication of how bedevilled the law has been in trying to give a meaning to the term “reckless” and its derivatives. See also R v Prentice [1994] QB 302 at 319 and, on appeal, R v Adomako [1995] 1 AC 171 to which I refer in more detail below.  
     
      
    178 A convenient starting point in the consideration of prior authority dealing with the concept of manslaughter by criminal negligence is Bateman (1925) 19 Cr App R 8, one of the two most commonly cited authorities in this area of the law. Having regard to what I see as the misunderstanding or misrepresentation of what was said in this and other cases, it is necessary to quote from them at some length. In the course of delivering the reasons of the court, Hewart LCJ said (at p10-12):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In expounding the law to juries on the trial of indictments for manslaughter by negligence, judges have often referred to the distinction between civil and criminal liability for death by negligence. The law of criminal liability for negligence is conveniently explained in that way. If A. has caused the death of B. by alleged negligence, then, in order to establish civil liability, the plaintiff must prove (in addition to pecuniary loss caused by the death) that A. owed a duty to B. to take care, that that duty was not discharged, and that the default caused the death of B. To convict A. of manslaughter, the prosecution must prove the three things above mentioned and must satisfy the jury, in addition, that A.’s negligence amounted to a crime. In the civil action, if it is proved that A. fell short of the standard of reasonable care required by law, it matters not how far he fell short of that standard. The extent of his liability depends not on the degree of negligence, but on the amount of damage done. In a criminal Court, on the contrary, the amount and degree of negligence are the determining question. There must be  
        mens rea  
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “In explaining to juries the test which they should apply to determine whether the negligence, in the particular case, amounted or did not amount to a crime, judges have used many epithets, such as “culpable”, “criminal”, “gross”, “wicked”, “clear”, “complete”. But, whatever epithet be used and whether an epithet be used or not, in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard to the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment. 
        
       
       
        
        It remains to consider the application of this principle to cases like the present where death has been caused, in the exercise of his calling, by the alleged negligence of a person professing special knowledge and skill, and a charge of manslaughter is preferred. The following cases may be cited as illustrating the language in which criminal negligence of this kind has been discussed and explained by judges in modern times.” 
        
       
      
    179 His Lordship then referred to some 15 prior decisions, including R v Nicholls (1884) 13 Cox CC 75, referred to by Yeldham J and R v Doherty (1887) 16 Cox CC 306 which was referred to in Callaghan v R (1952) 87 CLR 115 and continued (at p12-13):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The law as laid down in these cases may be thus summarised: If a person holds himself out as possessing special skill and knowledge and he is consulted, as possessing such skill and knowledge, by or on behalf of a patient, he owes a duty to the patient to use due caution in undertaking the treatment. If he accepts the responsibility and undertakes the treatment and the patient submits to his direction and treatment accordingly, he owes a duty to the patient to use diligence, care, knowledge, skill and caution in administering the treatment. No contractual relation is necessary, nor is it necessary that the service be rendered for reward. It is for the judge to direct the jury what standard to apply and for the jury to say whether that standard has been reached. The jury should not exact the highest, or a very high, standard, nor should they be content with a very low standard. The law requires a fair and reasonable standard of care and competence. This standard must be reached in all the matters above mentioned. If the patient’s death has been caused by the defendant’s indolence or carelessness, it will not avail to show that he had sufficient knowledge; nor will it avail to prove that he was diligent in attendance, if the patient has been killed by his gross ignorance and unskilfulness. No further observation need be made with regard to cases where the death is alleged to have been caused by indolence or carelessness. As regards cases where incompetence is alleged, it is only necessary to say that the unqualified practitioner cannot claim to be measured by any lower standard than that which is applied to a qualified man. As regards cases of alleged recklessness, juries are likely to distinguish between the qualified and the unqualified man. There may be recklessness in undertaking the treatment and recklessness in the conduct of it. It is, no doubt, conceivable that a qualified man may be held liable for recklessly undertaking a case which he knew, or should have known, to be beyond his powers, or for making his patient the subject of reckless experiment. Such cases are likely to be rare. In the case of the quack, where the treatment has been proved to be incompetent and to have caused the patient’s death, juries are not likely to hesitate in finding liability on the ground that the defendant undertook, and continued to treat, a case involving the gravest risk to his patient, when he knew he was not competent to deal with it, or would have known if he had paid any proper regard to the life and safety of his patient. 
        
       
       
        
        The foregoing observations deal with civil liability. To support an indictment for manslaughter the prosecution must prove the matters necessary to establish civil liability (except pecuniary loss), and, in addition, must satisfy the jury that the negligence or incompetence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment.” 
        
       
      
    180 A number of observations may be made concerning these remarks. The first is that His Lordship’s references to recklessness in the course of making remarks concerning civil liability tend to demonstrate the point made above concerning the imprecision of the term. It cannot be thought that his Lordship was, by his use of the term in that context, intending to indicate a need for either an awareness of risk or indifference as to consequences, matters quite unnecessary for civil liability. 
     
      
    181 Secondly, when discussing manslaughter, nowhere does his Lordship suggest that in addition to the appropriate degree of negligence there must also be either an awareness of risk or indifference to it. Thirdly the tenor of the paragraph commencing with the words “In explaining to juries the test which they should apply to determine whether the negligence, in the particular case, amounted or did not amount to a crime” is quite inconsistent with the proposition that the negligence referred to would not amount to a crime unless it were accompanied by one or both of an awareness of risk and indifference to consequences. 
     
      
    182 The second of the two most commonly cited cases in this area is Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576. The substance of the reasoning of Lord Atkin, with whom the other members of the House of Lords agreed, is contained in the following passage at p581-3 (and which for convenience I have broken into paragraphs):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In the present case it is only necessary to consider manslaughter from the point of view of an unintentional killing caused by negligence, that is, the omission of a duty to take care. I do not propose to discuss the development of this branch of the subject as treated in the successive treatises of Coke, Hale, Foster and East and in the judgments of the Courts to be found either in directions to juries by individual judges or in the more considered pronouncements of the body of judges which preceded the formal Court of Crown Cases Reserved. Expressions will be found which indicate that to cause death by any lack of due care will amount to manslaughter; but as manners softened and the law became more humane a narrower criterion appeared. After all, manslaughter is a felony, and was capital, and men shrank from attaching the serious consequences of a conviction for felony to results produced by mere inadvertence. 
        
       
       
        
        The stricter view became apparent in prosecutions of medical men or men who professed medical or surgical skill for manslaughter by reason of negligence. As an instance I will cite  
        Rex v Williamson  
        (1807) 3 C & P 635 where a man who practised as an accoucheur, owing to a mistake in his observation of the actual symptoms, inflicted on a patient terrible injuries from which she died. ‘To substantiate that charge’ – namely, manslaughter – Lord Ellenborough said, ‘the prisoner must have been guilty of criminal misconduct, arising either from the grossest ignorance or the most criminal inattention.’ The word “criminal” in any attempt to define a crime is perhaps not the most helpful: but it is plain that the Lord Chief Justice meant to indicate to the jury a high degree of negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        So at a much later date in  
        Rex v Bateman 
         (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 a charge of manslaughter was made against a qualified medical practitioner in similar circumstances to those of  
        Williamson’s 
         case. In a considered judgment of the Court the Lord Chief Justice, after pointing out that in a civil case once negligence is proved the degree of negligence is irrelevant said (19 Cr App R 11), ‘In a criminal Court, on the contrary, the amount and degree of negligence are the determining question. There must be mens rea.’ 
        
       
       
        
        After citing  
        Cashill v Wright  
        (1856) 6 E & B 891 a civil case, the Lord Chief Justice proceeds: ‘In explaining to juries the test which they should apply to determine whether the negligence, in the particular case, amounted or did not amount to a crime, judges have used many epithets such as “culpable”, “criminal”, “gross”, “wicked”, “clear”, “complete”. But whatever epithet be used and whether an epithet be used or not, in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Here again I think with respect that the expressions used are not, indeed they probably were not intended to be, a precise definition of the crime. I do not myself find connotations of mens rea helpful in distinguishing between degrees of negligence, nor do the ideas of crime and punishment in themselves carry a jury much further in deciding whether in a particular case the degree of negligence shown is a crime and deserves punishment. But the substance of the judgment is most valuable and in my opinion is correct. In practice it has generally been adopted by judges in charging juries in all cases of manslaughter by negligence, whether in driving vehicles or otherwise. The principle to be observed in that cases of manslaughter in driving motor cars are but instances of a general rule applicable to all charges of homicide by negligence. Simple lack of care such as will constitute civil liability is not enough: for purposes of the criminal law there are degrees of negligence: and a very high degree of negligence is required to be proved before the felony is established. 
        
       
       
        
        Probably of all the epithets that can be applied “reckless” most nearly covers the case. It is difficult to visualize a case of death caused by reckless driving in the connotation of that term in ordinary speech which would not justify a conviction for manslaughter: but it is probably not all-embracing, for “reckless” suggests an indifference to risk whereas the accused may have appreciated the risk and intended to avoid it and yet shown such a high degree of negligence in the means adopted to avoid the risk as would justify a conviction. If the principle of  
        Bateman’s  
        case is observed it will appear that the law of manslaughter has not changed by the introduction of motor vehicles on the road. Death caused by their negligent driving, though unhappily much more frequent, is to be treated in law as death caused by any other form of negligence: and juries should be directed accordingly.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    183 Prior to the statement in the last paragraph “Probably of all the epithets that can be applied ‘reckless’ most nearly covers the case”, there is nothing in his Lordship’s remarks to suggest that in addition to negligence of appropriate gravity, one or both of appreciation of risk or indifference to consequences is a pre-condition of liability. “Negligence”, “the omission of a duty to take care” “grossest ignorance”, “most criminal inattention” – explained as “a high degree of negligence”, and “a very high degree of negligence” are the terms used to describe the conduct giving rise to the liability for conviction of manslaughter. 
     
      
    184 And when his Lordship did come to use the term “reckless” he did so, not in terms indicative of something more than the conduct he had previously been referring to being required, but by using that term as an “epithet” which most nearly encompassed those to which he had earlier referred. 
     
      
    185 It may be acknowledged that his Lordship recognised that “reckless” suggests an indifference to risk and, at least implicitly, suggests that such conduct and also awareness of risk accompanied by a high degree of negligence in seeking to avoid it would justify conviction. However, it is impossible on a fair reading of all his Lordship said to conclude that negligence he had previously referred to as “of a “high degree”, “culpable”, “criminal”, “gross”, “wicked”, or “going beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and show(ing) such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment” was not sufficient for liability unless also there was in an accused an appreciation of the risk or an indifference to it. 
     
      
    186 And if, as is suggested in the last paragraph quoted, appreciation of the risk and a “high degree of negligence in the means adopted to avoid” it, is sufficient for liability, why should not a (sufficiently) “high degree of negligence” in other respects, for example not appreciating the risk, not be a sufficient criteria for liability? 
     
      
    187 Of the other cases referred to in R v Taktak, R v Stone & Dobinson [1977] 1 QB 354 is sufficiently summarised in the passage I have quoted from Yeldham J’s reasons. Although accepting that the relevant law was laid down in Andrews v DPP and in the approval given in that case to remarks in R v Bateman, and then quoting the passage towards the end of the third paragraph of the passage I have quoted from Andrews v DPP commencing with the words “Simple lack of care such as will constitute civil liability is not enough”, the court in R v Stone & Dobinson went on to make the lengthy assertion which Yeldham J quoted. 
     
      
    188 However, and despite what was said in R v Adomako [1995] 1 AC 171, a simple comparison of what was said in Bateman and Andrews on the one hand and the statement from R v Stone & Dobinson demonstrates that those earlier authorities provide no support whatsoever for the proposition adumbrated in that latter case (at p363) to the effect that the prosecution “have to prove” conduct which “could properly be described as reckless, that is to say a reckless disregard of danger to the health and welfare of the infirm person” or that “the defendant must be proved to have been indifferent to an obvious risk of injury to health, or actually to have foreseen the risk but to have determined nevertheless to run it.” (my emphasis) 
     
      
    189 Indeed the latter passage is quite inconsistent with a passage from remarks in Bateman quoted just above it – [1977] 1 QB at 363:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(Reckless driving) is probably not all embracing for ‘reckless’ suggests an indifference to risk whereas the accused may have appreciated the risk and intended to avoid it and yet have shown such a high degree of negligence in the means adopted to avoid the risk as would justify a conviction”. 
        
       
      
    190 R v Nicholls (1874) 13 Cox CC 75, relied upon by Yeldham J in R v Taktak (at p247) for the proposition that an offender must have “a wicked mind, in the sense that she was reckless and careless whether the creature (her grandchild) died or not”, is certainly authority for that proposition. However, R v Nicholls was one of the fifteen cases referred to towards the beginning of the passage I have cited from Bateman and was thus clearly considered by the court in that case. Consisting as the passage does as part of a single judge’s direction to a jury it does not have the authority of the Court of Criminial Appeal in Bateman or the House of Lords in Andrews v DPP. Whether what was said in R v Nicholls goes beyond what was said in those 2 cases depends on the meaning one attributes to the words used but if and insofar as it does go beyond the law as laid down in Bateman  and Andrews v DPP, the remarks must be regarded as wrong. 
     
      
    191 R v Bonnyman [1942] 28 Cr App R 131 was another of the cases referred to by Yeldham J in R v Taktak. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to, inter alia, the cases of Nicholls, Bateman and Andrews and (at p 135-6) pointed out that the word “reckless” had now been “approved by the House of Lords as probably in all the circumstances the best epithet to use to help a jury to understand that a special or a high degree of negligence must be found by them before they can return a verdict of manslaughter.” That statement does little to elucidate what was meant by the term “reckless”.  
     
      
    192 In the last of the cases referred to by Yeldham J, R v Holzer [1968] VR 481, Smith J said (at 482):- 
     
      
       
        
        “We are not here concerned with any possible doctrine of felony manslaughter: Furthermore, we are not here concerned with the doctrine of manslaughter by criminal negligence, under which, as I understand the law found upon the House of Lords’ decision in  
        Andrews v DPP 
         [1937] A.C. 576; [1937] 2 All E.R. 552, the accused must be shown to have acted not only in gross breach of a duty of care but recklessly, in the sense that he realized that he was creating an appreciate risk of really serious bodily injury to another or others and that nevertheless he chose to run the risk.” 
        
       
      
    193 These remarks were made in the course of a trial and were obviously obiter. They suffer from the fact that, as I have pointed out, Andrews v DPP is not authority for the propositions his Honour attributed to it. In Nydam v R (at 439-440) the court said that the dictum of Smith J had been accepted as a correct statement of law in that State but that it should not be. 
     
      
    194 There are 3 further English authorities to which I should refer. The first is Akarele v R [1943] AC 255. That was a decision of the Privy Council in a case where a medical practitioner had been found guilty, in a judge alone trial, of manslaughter. In the course of their advice their Lordships said (at p261-4 and omitting the footnotes):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned judge goes on to ask whether, on this evidence, it can be said that the accused was guilty of negligence in a criminal degree in causing the death of Kalu Ibe. No complaint can be made of what he says in reference to the degree which the courts have held essential to constitute a criminal offence of negligence. He quotes the observations of Lord Hewart CJ in  
        R v Bateman 
        : that a doctor is not criminally responsible for a patient’s death unless his negligence or incompetence “went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State”, and adds from Halsbury’s Laws of England, 2nd Ed., Vol. ix., tit. “Criminal Law” p444: “What amount of negligence is to be regarded as gross is a question of degree for the jury, depending on the circumstances of each particular case”. Both statements are true and, perhaps, cannot safely be made more definite, but it must be remembered that the degree of negligence required is that it should be gross, and that neither a jury nor a court can transform negligence of a lesser degree into gross negligence merely by giving it that appellation. The further words spoken by the Lord Chief Justice in the same case are, in their Lordships’ opinion, at least as important as those which have been set out: “It is desirable that, as far as possible, the explanation of criminal negligence to a jury should not be a mere question of epithets. It is, in a sense, a question of degree, and it is for the jury to draw the line, but there is a difference in kind between the negligence which gives a right to compensation and the negligence which is a crime”. 
        
       
        
      
    195 In R v Adomako [1995] 1 AC 171, the defendant was an anaesthetist during an operation in which the patient died. The occasion of the matter coming before the House of Lords was because that body had, in prior decisions – see R v Lawrence (Stephen) [1982] AC 510; R v Seymour (Edward) [1983] 2 AC 493 - said that the test for motor manslaughter was different from that which was thought to apply to other cases of manslaughter by criminal negligence. 
     
      
    196 The Lord Chancellor, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, quoted at length from R v Bateman and Andrews v DPP and continued (at p187-9):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion the law as stated in these two authorities is satisfactory as providing a proper basis for describing the crime of involuntary manslaughter. Since the decision in  
        Andrews  
        was a decision of your Lordships’ House, it remains the most authoritative statement of the present law which I have been able to find… On this basis in my opinion the ordinary principles of the law of negligence apply to ascertain whether or not the defendant has been in breach of a duty of care towards the victim who has died. If such breach of duty is established the next question is whether that breach of duty caused the death of the victim. If so, the jury must go on to consider whether that breach of duty should be characterised as gross negligence and therefore as a crime. This will depend on the seriousness of the breach of duty committed by the defendant in all the circumstances in which the defendant was placed when it occurred. The jury will have to consider whether the extent to which the defendant’s conduct departed from the proper standard of care incumbent upon him, involving as it must have done a risk of death to the patient, was such that it should be judged criminal. 
        
       
       
        
        It is true that to a certain extent this involves an element of circularity, but in this branch of the law I do not believe that is fatal to its being correct as a test of how far conduct must depart from accepted standards to be characterised as criminal. This is necessarily a question of degree and an attempt to specify that degree more closely is I think likely to achieve only a spurious precision. The essence of the matter which is supremely a jury question is whether having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission… 
        
       
       
        
        I consider it perfectly appropriate that the word “reckless” should be used in cases of involuntary manslaughter, but as Lord Atkin put it “in the ordinary connotation of that word”. Examples in which this was done, to my mind, with complete accuracy are  
        R v Stone  
        [1977] QB 354 and  
        R v West London Coroner 
          
        ex parte Gray 
         [1988] QB 467. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion is quite unnecessary in the context of gross negligence to give the detailed directions with regard to the meaning of the word “reckless” associated with  
        R v Lawrence 
         [1982] AC 510…  
        
       
       
        
        For these reasons I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and that the certified question should be answered by saying: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “In cases of manslaughter by criminal negligence involving a breach of duty, it is a sufficient direction to the jury to adopt the gross negligence test set out by the Court of Appeal in the present case following  
          R v Bateman 
           19 Crim App R 8 and  
          Andrews v DPP 
           [1937] AC 576 and that it is not necessary to refer to the definition of recklessness in  
          R v Lawrence 
           [1982] AC 510, although it is perfectly open to the trial judge to use the word “reckless” in its ordinary meaning as part of his exposition of the law if he deems it appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    197 The “gross negligence test set out by the Court of Appeal” to which reference was made was in these terms – see R v Prentice [1994] QB 302 at 322 (a case which contains a very useful discussion of the topic): 
     
      
       
        
        “Accordingly, except in motor manslaughter, the ingredients of involuntary manslaughter by breach of duty which need to be proved are (1) the existence of the duty; (2) a breach of the duty causing death; (3) gross negligence which the jury consider justifies a criminal conviction.” 
        
       
      
    198 What was said in R v Stone & Dobinson has already been referred to. In R v West London Coroner, Ex parte Gray [1988] QB 467, Watkins LJ, with the concurrence of Roch J, said (at p476-7), in the context of a challenge to the instructions given to a coroner’s jury on the topic of unlawful killing:- 
     
      
       
        
        “What the jury should have been told was that when considering manslaughter by neglect, they would have to be satisfied upon the evidence of these four ingredients of the offence: (1) A police officer had the duty of regarding the health and welfare of Mikkelsen. (2) He failed to do what in the circumstances he ought to have done for the health and welfare of Mikkelsen. (3) That his failure was a substantial cause of Mikkelsen’s death. (4) That in failing to act for the benefit of Mikkelsen’s health and welfare he acted recklessly. It should be explained that to act recklessly means that there was an obvious and serious risk to the health and welfare of Mikkelsen to which that police officer, having regard to his duty, was indifferent or, recognising that risk to be present, he deliberately chose to run the risk by doing nothing about it. It should be emphasised, however, that a failure to appreciate that there was such a risk would not by itself be sufficient to amount to recklessness.” 
        
       
      
    199 I understand the endorsement in R v Adomako of R v Stone & Dobinson and R v West London Coroner, Ex Parte Gray to be only as to their exposition of the concept of recklessness. Otherwise it is impossible to reconcile the suggestion in these cases that recklessness or indifference to, or appreciation of risk are required, with the balance of the remarks I have quoted from R v Adomako (or with those in Akarele v R, Bateman or Andrews v DPP). 
     
      
    200 I turn to some other Australian authorities. R v Gunter (1921) 21 SR (NSW) 282 was a case where the conduct which had led to the charge involved applying a douche to a pregnant woman. The Chief Justice, with the assent of the other members of the Court of Criminal Appeal said (at 286):- 
     
      
       
        
        “(The trial judge) pointed out to the jury that the negligence necessary to make a man criminally responsible must be gross negligence. The cases in which that topic has been discussed are fairly numerous, and, carefully abstaining from any attempt to put into new language the principles laid down by the Judges, I think it is very plain from many authorities that that negligence which is essential before a man can be criminally convicted must be culpable, exhibiting a degree of recklessness beyond anything required to make a man liable for damages in a civil action. It must be such a degree of culpable negligence as to amount to an absence of that care for the lives and persons of others which every law-abiding man is expected to exhibit. Short of this he may be blameworthy because he has not exhibited the caution reasonable to be expected from an ordinarily prudent person in the particular situation, and this would expose him to an action for damages. But the charge of a criminal offence based on negligence must be supported by a culpable recklessness in taking risks at the expense of other people’s lives or limbs.”  
        
       
      
    201 The Chief Justice referred to the evidence and the trial judge’s summing up, quoting the following passage (at p 287):- 
     
      
       
        
        “If he held himself out to be a skilled man, and, having treated those people for years, he used an instrument that he ought not to have used, and used it so carelessly as to pump air in, and not into the part that he intended to, but something higher up and much more dangerous, was he guilty of gross negligence or not. That is the question for you.” 
         
         
        … When a man therefore undertakes and holds himself out to be able to do a particular kind of work, and in this case whether he be a doctor or not, if he holds himself out to be able to wash out a woman’s private parts, he is supposed to have sufficient skill for that purpose. If he does it so negligently as to place the instruments that he uses in the wrong spot, or to force in something that he ought not to force in, it will be a question for you whether he is guilty of gross negligence, and if you find that he has been guilty of such negligence, then you will find a verdict of manslaughter against Gunter.” 
        
       
      
    202 The Chief Justice then proceeded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that the attention of the jury was directed to the real points arising for their consideration in the case and that there was sufficient evidence of such gross and culpable negligence as to support the conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        For those reasons it seems to me that this appeal ought to be dismissed and leave to appeal on the facts refused.” 
        
       
      
    203 Although in the first of the passages I have quoted the Chief Justice used the term “recklessness” as descriptive of the conduct required for a conviction, his Honour’s acceptance of the trial judge’s expression “gross negligence” demonstrates that the former expression was not being used to indicate that there must be either a conscious appreciation of the risk or indifference to it. 
     
      
    204 In R v Newell (1927) 27 SR (NSW) 274 at 276-7 Street CJ, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, quoted that part of the passage I have first set out from R v Gunter as commences “I think it very plain” and concludes “is expected to exhibit” and continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Bateman’s Case 
         (19 C A R 8), Lord Hewart LCJ, in dealing with the question of criminal responsibility for negligence, said: ‘To support an indictment for manslaughter the prosecution must prove the matters necessary to establish civil liability, except pecuniary loss, and in addition must satisfy the jury that the negligence or incompetence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State, and conduct deserving punishment’.”  
        
       
      
    205 His Honour went on:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Applying those principles to the facts of this case, was there any evidence on which the jury would be justified in coming to the conclusion that the applicant exhibited such culpable negligence as to make him criminally responsible for what happened?” 
        
       
      
    206 Nowhere in the case is there any suggestion that appreciation of risk or indifference to consequences was required, before conviction was justified.  
     
      
    207 In R v Wood [1957] SR (NSW) 638 the trial judge had directed a jury to the effect that the test was whether the offender’s conduct as amounted to negligence or carelessness was “gross” or “culpable” or something more than a right of action between A and B and “something in which the State is concerned.” The Court held that His Honour having also directed the jury that before they could convict they must find the Appellant drove a car in such a fashion that death or destruction was likely to occur the directions were adequate and that it was not necessary for the jury to be directed in the terms of the passage in R v Gunter, viz., 
     
      
       
        
        “(T)hat negligence which is essential before a man can be criminally convicted must be culpable, exhibiting a degree of recklessness beyond anything required to make a man liable for damages in a civil action. It must be such a degree of culpable negligence as to amount to an absence of that care for the lives and persons of others which every law-abiding man is expected to exhibit.” 
        
       
      
    208 Again, there is no suggestion that appreciation of risk or indifference to consequences was required before the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence was made out. 
     
      
    209 In Brown v Robinson (1960) 60 SR (NSW) 297 the Court of Appeal had to consider whether an acquittal of someone charged with manslaughter by criminal negligence involved, in the circumstances of the case, a finding that he was not under the influence of alcohol at the time. In the course of their reasons Herron and Maguire JJ remarked (at 302-3):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… it now seems to be established by a decision of the House of Lords that in road accident cases at any rate some other element (i.e. other than an unlawful act) of a subjective character must be present and that element is tantamount to criminal negligence.  
        Andrews v DPP 
         (1937) AC 576. … In  
        R v Larkin 
         (1943) 1 All E R 217 Humphreys J., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal at 219 said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Perhaps it is as well that once more the proposition of law should be stated which has been stated for generations by judges and, so far as we are aware, never disputed or doubted. If a person is engaged in doing a lawful act, and in the course of doing that lawful act behaves so negligently as to cause the death of some other person, then it is for the jury to say, upon a consideration of the whole of the facts of the case, whether the negligence proved against the accused person amounts to manslaughter, and it is the duty of the presiding judge to tell them that it will not amount to manslaughter unless the negligence is of a very high degree; the expression most commonly used is unless it shows the accused to have been reckless as to the consequences of the act. That is where the act is lawful. Where the act which a person is engaged in is unlawful, then …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    210 Given the issue which was before the Court and the absence of any considered discussion on the topic, I regard the remarks quoted as having some, but slight, weight against the conclusion which I prefer as to the necessary elements of manslaughter by criminal negligence. 
     
      
    211 In R v Buttsworth [1983] 1 NSWLR 658 O’Brien CJ of Cr D discussed at length the differences between what he referred to as “motor manslaughter”, “culpable driving” or “driving in a manner dangerous to the public”, and negligence. The other judges sitting on the Court agreed with his remarks. It is sufficient for present purposes to quote a short passage (at 676-7):- 
     
      
       
        
        “(The offences) were designed to enforce the duty of the driver of a motor vehicle to take care for the safety of other users of the road and were concerned not with his state of mind but with his conduct in the management of his vehicle. … Being each designed to enforce a duty of care to other users of the road, the distinction between them depended fundamentally on the degree to which the driving departed form the standard of care to be expected of the ordinary reasonable man in the circumstances. … The departure from the standard of the ordinary reasonable man in the circumstances is variously defined but they remained a specification of the degree by which the driving departed from that standard. In particular the negligence in driving appropriate to manslaughter is described as reckless, an expression which may be further explained after a fashion which Lord Atkin approved in  
        Andrews’  
        case. It is a degree of negligence greater than that described by driving in a manner dangerous to the public …” 
        
       
      
    212 Despite the reference to “reckless”, I find it impossible to reconcile these remarks with a requirement in the case of manslaughter that there must be appreciation of risks or indifference to consequences. Earlier (at p675), O’Brien CJ At Cr D had referred to Nydam v R as laying down an objective test and, it seems to me, by way of drawing support from that decision for his own approach. 
     
      
    213 In R v Pullman (1991) 25 NSWLR 89 Hunt CL at CL said (at p91) that in a case of manslaughter based on criminal negligence “it is necessary for the Crown to establish such a high degree of negligence or disregard for the life and safety of others as to be regarded as a crime against the community generally and as conduct deserving punishment: Andrews v DPP (1937) AC 576 at 582-583”. Later (at p.93), his Honour said that the issue raised and decided in Andrews was “simply that, where an act is relied upon as being negligent and as amounting to manslaughter in the category of criminal negligence, the high degree of negligence described in R v Bateman had to be established”. So far as is presently relevant, the other members of the Court agreed. 
     
      
    214 As its name implies, NSW Sugar Milling Co-operative Limited v EPA (1992) 59 A Crim R 6 was not a case of manslaughter. It involved a question whether there had been a breach of s6(1) of the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act which, so far as is presently relevant made it an offence for someone to “wilfully or negligently cause any substance to leak, spill or otherwise escape … in a manner which harms or is likely to harm the environment”. Hunt CJ at CL said, at p7, that “In considering whether a defendant has acted negligently, the issue is decided upon an objective basis” both in civil cases and under the criminal law, citing for the latter part of this proposition R v Nydam and R v Buttsworth. His Honour also agreed generally with the reasons of Enderby J. 
     
      
    215 Enderby J said (at p11) that negligence was not a subjective, but an objective test and one which did not involve an enquiry into the subjective thinking of the person who is said to have been negligent. Allen J (at p12) also agreed generally with the reasons of Enderby J, going on to say that “The question is whether (the Appellant) fell so far short of the standard of care of an objectively reasonable person in the position in which it found itself that it was negligent to the criminal degree.” 
     
      
    216 In Callaghan v R (1952) 87 CLR 115 the High Court had to consider the meaning to be given to the expression “to use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions” in two sections of the Western Australian Criminal Code. The sections were in terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “266. It is the duty of every person who has in his charge or under his control anything, whether living or inanimate, and whether moving or stationary, of such a nature that, in the absence of care or precaution in its use or management, the life, safety, or health or any person may be endangered, to use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions to avoid such danger; and he is held to have caused any consequences which result to the life or health of any person by reason of any omission to perform that duty. 
        
       
       
        
        291A (1). Any person who has in his charge or under his control any vehicle and fails to use reasonable care and take reasonable precautions in the use and management of such vehicle whereby death is caused to another person is guilty of a crime and liable to imprisonment with hard labour for five years. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) This section shall not relieve a person of criminal responsibility for the unlawful killing of another person.” 
        
       
      
    217 For reasons it is unnecessary to recount the High Court concluded that breach of the duty of care imposed by Section 266 became one of the constituents of the crime of manslaughter. Their Honour’s conclusion was that the standard set by both sections should be regarded as that set by the common law in cases where negligence amounts to manslaughter. In arriving at their conclusion the Court, consisting of Dixon CJ, Webb, Fullager and Kitto JJ said (at p122-4):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In his judicial capacity Sir  
        James Fitzjames Stephen  
        in summing up to a jury explained as follows the neglect which may make a man guilty of manslaughter. ‘Manslaughter by negligence occurs when a person is doing anything dangerous in itself, or has charge of anything dangerous in itself and conducts himself in regard to it in such a careless manner that the jury feel that he is guilty of culpable negligence and ought to be punished. As to what act of negligence is culpable you, gentlemen, have a discretion and you ought to exercise it as well as you can’.  
        R v Doherty  
        (1887) 16 Cox CC 306 at 309 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Andrews v DPP 
         Lord Atkin deals with the common law felony of manslaughter a little differently: ‘Simple lack of care such as will constitute civil liability is not enough: for purposes of the criminal law there are degrees of negligence: and a very high degree of negligence is required to be proved before the felony is established. Probably of all the epithets that can be applied “reckless” most nearly covers the case.’ …. 
        
       
       
        
        In Sir  
        James Fitzjames Stephens History of Criminal Law 
        , vol. 3, pp 9-11, there is a treatment of the common law in relation to killing by omission representing the same approach as these sections of the Bill exhibit. The author says: ‘By the law of this country killing by omission is in no case criminal unless the thing omitted is one which it is a legal duty to do. Hence, in order to ascertain what kinds of killing by omission are criminal, it is necessary in the first place to ascertain the duties which tend to the preservation of life’. He proceeds to enumerate these duties. In his enumeration, he includes a duty to do dangerous acts in a careful manner, and a duty to take proper precautions in dealing with dangerous things. He deals with the question of the degree of want of care in the following passage: ‘To cause death by the omission of any such duty is homicide, but there is a distinction of a somewhat indefinite kind as to the case in which it is and is not unlawful in the sense of being criminal. In order that homicide by omission may be criminal, the omission must amount to what is sometimes called gross, and sometimes  
        culpable 
         negligence. There must be more; but no one can say how much more negligence than is required in order to create a civil liability. For instance, many railway accidents are caused by a momentary forgetfulness or want of presence of mind, which are sufficient to involve the railway in civil liability, but are not sufficient to make the railway servant guilty of manslaughter if death is caused. No rule exists in such cases. It is a matter of degree determined by the view the jury happen to take in each particular case’. …  
        
       
       
        
        In  
        McCarthy v The King  
        (1921) 59 DLR 206 at 208 Duff J expressed his view of a provision of the Canadian Criminal Code … similar to s266 of the Western Australian Code. He said that it did not, he thought, substantially change the common law. He then proceeded: ‘There may I think, be cases in which the Judge ought to tell the jury that the conduct of the accused in order to incriminate him under this section must be such as to imply a certain indifferent to consequences, but such cases, I think, must be rare and this assuredly is not one of them. Where the accused, having brought into operation a dangerous agency which he has under this control (that is to say dangerous in the sense that it is calculated to endanger human life), fails to take those precautions which a man of ordinary humanity and reasonable competent understanding would take in the given circumstances for the purpose of avoiding or neutralising the risk, his conduct in itself implies a degree of recklessness justifying the description “gross negligence’.” 
        
       
      
    218 I have quoted at length from Callaghan v R for, although the matter at issue in that case was as to the proper construction of sections of the Western Australian Criminal Code, the standing of the court and of the judges who participated in the decision is such as to put almost beyond argument the correctness of the law as stated. Their Honour’s reliance on the statements of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen indicates they agreed with, or at least accepted the accuracy of, what he had said. His statements make it clear that the test for manslaughter by negligence, in circumstances when things dangerous are being done or used, is simply negligence or carelessness which is bad enough to fit within the descriptions “culpable”, “ought to be punished” or “gross”, it being a matter for a jury to decide whether the offending conduct falls within that description. 
     
      
    219 Furthermore, their Honours quotation from McCarthy v The King means that they cannot but have been conscious of the difference between negligence or gross negligence on the one hand and recklessness in the sense of indifference to consequences and, implicitly, recognition of the risk of such consequences on the other. Their reference, without adverse comment, to the remarks they quoted from McCarthy v The King that it will be a rare case where indifference to consequences will be spoken of to a jury is a further endorsement of the view that indifference, and therefore appreciation, is not an essential ingredient of manslaughter by criminal negligence.

      70080/03 - REGINA v ANDREW BERNARD MOLONEY 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Andrew Bernard Moloney the jury have found you guilty of murder and two offences of attempting to maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm and it is my task to sentence you for those crimes. 
     
      
    2 The facts are within a tragically short compass. On 25 October 2002 you went with your partner Miss Forbes-Kennedy to the Sportsman's Hotel Blacktown and proceeded to consume beer and use hotel amusement facilities. You arrived at about 11.30am in a Ford Fairlane car which had been recently acquired by Miss Forbes-Kennedy. During the early afternoon she left the hotel for an extended period in company with one Desmond Yarnold and another. After their return you became engaged in a fight with Yarnold in the gaming room, that is a part of the hotel furnished with poker machines. The cause of the fight and who started it, I find irrelevant. The victim of the murder, Patrick Canty, attended to discharge his duty to keep order in the premises. He was the licensee. It was about 3.30pm. 
     
      
    3 Mr Canty ordered you off the premises and escorted you out. You were reluctant to leave. In that there was physical contact with you I find that Mr Canty's actions were reasonable and, in fairness to you, I accept that you had never asserted in conversation with investigating police or through your counsel that you were provoked by any conduct of his. 
     
      
    4 The victims named in the second and third counts, Mr McDonald and Mr Murray, were employees of the hotel who came to assist. 
     
      
    5 You were obliged to occupy your vehicle and depart. I am satisfied that verbal exchange included utterances by you along the lines of ""I'll be back"" and ""I'll fucking fix you."" This indicated a festering anger which was focused upon these men who were ejecting you from the hotel. 
     
      
    6 Nevertheless you drove relatively slowly towards the car park exit and I accept that it was the loud whistle by Miss Forbes-Kennedy which caused you to stop. Whether, absent that call you would have continued on your way I do not know, but I am not persuaded that you would not have exited the area. 
     
      
    7 However, be that as it may, you turned the car. You saw the three men walking in the available carriageway between rows of parked cars. You accelerated this relatively powerful vehicle. As found by the jury and I find for the purpose of sentence you formed the intention at the time to cause really serious injury to these three men upon whom, as I have said, you focused your anger. 
     
      
    8 You drove directly at them. You neither braked nor swerved. That the weapon of opportunity was a powerful motor car does not transmute your crimes into some sort of traffic incident and it should be emphasised that your actions were seriously criminal. 
     
      
    9 The real issue at trial was whether you formed the intention to do grievous bodily harm. It was argued that gross intoxication led to your not having that specific intent. 
     
      
    10 I have considered the evidence including that of staff and patrons of the hotel concerning their various opinions of your appearance in regard to intoxication. I take into account your claim to police that you are an alcoholic and your mother's evidence corroborating that claim. 
     
      
    11 Your counsel has submitted that alcohol played a part in your offences. I accept that it did. I am not satisfied that your ingestion, prior to commission of the offences, was a factor, however, beyond a causing disinhibition and a decision to give free rein to venting your anger. Your drinking of alcohol did not affect your formation of intent to cause really serious injury to the three men nor did it affect your appreciation that the carrying out of that intention by striking with the car would have that result. 
     
      
    12 You claimed to fear that these men might beat you up if you returned. I reject that. I find that any fear you harboured developed after you fatally wounded Mr Canty and you became conscious of the understandable feelings of the people who had gathered at the scene. Your immediate reaction was not of remorse but of defiance and this was manifested by your finger gesture, your spitting and your remark ""Fuck you all."" I accept that these were directed at the crowd and not to your victim. 
     
      
    13 There is no present purpose in my recapitulating the details of your arrest beyond recording my rejection of the proposition that you were on your way to surrender to the police at Blacktown. Hiding in the video store as police passed by contradicts that notion. 
     
      
    14 I am satisfied that your intoxicated presentation on arrest was a consequence of rapid consumption of beer and spirit after you left the scene. 
     
      
    15 Whilst you hid from police to avoid immediate arrest, it can be accepted that you did not take flight from the area of your then current residence. 
     
      
    16 I turn to some subjective matters. You will be 40 years of age in two days time. You have a criminal record which acts as a counter to leniency which otherwise might be extended to you. They are aggravating features, that you were at conditional liberty on bail in respect of offences which in fact were dealt with after your arrest and were subject to suspended sentences imposed in Brisbane District Court in March 2001. The crimes for which those impositions were made included two charges of robbery with actual violence whilst armed committed in May and June 2000 respectively. The period of suspension in accordance with the Queensland sentencing law was 5 years. I note the continuing support which you have from your mother and her observations of your improved condition whilst in custody. I accept the evidence of the Reverend Baynes of your expressions to him of distress about your taking of human life. I note steps taken in connection with fears that you may self harm. I further accept that you have expressed interest in restorative justice but this is a matter in which the attitude of the deceased's family is determinative. It is to your credit that you are apparently willing to offer. 
     
      
    17 Victim Impact Statements have been read by Mr Canty's widow and his father. No objection was taken to this course but it should be pointed out that, whilst the operative statute defines various relatives as immediate family, s 30A of the Act which came into force on 23 June 2003 provides for the reading out in court of the whole or part of a Victim Impact Statement which has been received by the court. 
     
      
    18 There is binding authority concerning the use to which such a statement may not be put and restriction is clearly in harmony with the circumstance that proceedings such as these do not seek to evaluate the life that has been lost but to punish the offender in accordance with established principles relevant to the assessment of sentence. 
     
      
    19 There is, however, an obvious purpose discernible in the provision for the reading out of the statement and that is to drive home to you, the offender, the dreadful consequences of your crime. No one could fail to have been moved by Mrs Canty's words and I did not fail to observe that, like many others in this Court, you shed tears during her reading. You expressed remorse to police. I have mentioned your contact with the Reverend Baynes. I accept that you are remorseful but, of course, you also appreciate that what you have done is beyond repair. 
     
      
    20 There are litanies of aggravating and mitigating factors to which I must have regard in compliance with the operative statute. Applicable recitation has been included in a helpful written submission by the Crown. And as, with one exception to which I will refer, there is no debate about what has been written between counsel. I will not pause to incant what can be read there. It may be treated as incorporated. I have given account to the factors I have identified as relevant. 
     
      
    21 The exception is a submission that Mr Canty was vulnerable in terms of s 21A(2)(l) because he was the hotel licensee. As mentioned in an exchange with counsel I would only assess vulnerability because Mr Canty was on foot and you were driving a large powerful motor car. 
     
      
    22 The absence of alcohol is submitted to be a guide towards a finding that you have good prospects of rehabilitation. Your prior record, however, restrains me from positive finding in your favour. 
     
      
    23 I am satisfied that the three crimes should be treated as the consequences of the one outburst of criminal conduct on your part and the sentences for all three matters will be served concurrently. As was submitted, and I accept, your crimes were not planned or premeditated. 
     
      
    24 Your culpable intention was to cause really serious injury but not specifically to kill. Your crime of murder is not in the worst category nor are you in the category of the worst offenders. I am not persuaded of the existence of special circumstances leading to departure from the statutory formula when setting non-parole periods. 
     
      
    25 You have been in custody since 25 October 2002 and sentence should date from then. I ignore some parts of short sentences imposed in the Local Court which have been served during that custody. In making my assessment of sentence I record that I have considered the statistical collations made available by the Judicial Commission. 
     
      
    26 Andrew Bernard Moloney, on the first count for the murder of Patrick David Canty you are sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years to date from 25 October 2002, expiring on 24 October 2022 with a non-parole period of 15 years to date from 25 October 2002, expiring on 24 October 2017. 
     
      
    27 On each of the second and third counts for attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm on Adam McDonald and Duane Murray, respectively, with intent to do grievous bodily harm you are sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years to date from 25 October 2002 expiring on 24 October 2008 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to date from 25 October 2002 expiring on 24 April 2007. 
     
      
    28 The three sentences are all to be served concurrently. The earliest date for consideration of eligibility for parole is specified as 24 October 2017.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Dunford J. 
     
      
    2 DUNFORD J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the applicant by his Honour Blanch CJ DC in the District Court at Sydney on 12 November 2001 following the applicant’s plea of guilty to one count of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900, an offence for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. The victim was the wife of the applicant. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years to date from 14 January 2001, and having found special circumstances, his Honour fixed a non-parole period of 4 years. 
     
      
    3 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour also took into account, in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act 1999, an additional charge of possess unauthorised firearm. 
     
      
    4 The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was not filed until 11 December 2003, and was therefore out of time. The Crown takes no point on the late filing of the Notice and the applicant’s explanation for the delay is that he does not speak English and was previously unaware of his right to appeal. I would therefore extend the time for filing the Notice. 
     
      
    5 The applicant and his wife were married in Poland in 1982 and they migrated to Australia in 1983. They have a son aged some 18 years but the applicant and his wife separated in about 1992/1993. Notwithstanding that separation, the applicant continued his stay periodically at his wife’s home address at Maroubra. She allowed this to occur so as to maintain a harmonious relationship for the benefit of their son.  
     
      
    6 On the evening of 3 January 2001, the applicant, his wife and her mother dined at that address and the applicant drove his wife’s mother home. He came back at about 10 o’clock and he went to bed while his wife did some business work and washing up. 
     
      
    7 At about 11pm the applicant went to the study of the house where his wife was, there was some argument, and the applicant said, “If you don’t want me to stay here, I’ll shoot myself”. His wife tried to pass that off as a joke and said, “Well why don’t you harm me and not yourself?” The applicant then pushed a small silver coloured handgun about 10 centimetres in length into the left side of his wife’s temple. His wife recognised this handgun as a gun the applicant had used when he worked as a magician both in Poland and in Australia. 
     
      
    8 The applicant pulled the trigger a number of times but the gun did not go off, and the applicant said, “ I don’t know why it doesn’t work, but sooner or later it will fire”. His wife struggled with the applicant as he pulled the trigger of the gun, and eventually it did fire. A bullet went through the centre of his wife’s forehead causing it to bleed profusely, and the applicant then said, “Yes, I shot you”, but his wife continued to struggle. She broke free and ran to the front door and opened it. 
     
      
    9 The applicant caught up with her and picked up an eighty centimetre long wooden lamp stand and struck her about the head area several times. She managed to get out of the door and she sought help in the street.  
     
      
    10 The applicant dropped the handgun in the front yard of the house and drove off. His wife was treated at the Prince of Wales Hospital for a bullet wound and other lacerations to her head area, and a bullet was removed from the top inner skull area of her head.  
     
      
    11 The police went to the applicant’s address and found him walking down the driveway covered in blood from what appeared to be self-inflicted wounds to his throat and forearms, and he was taken to the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick. He had also obviously taken an overdose of prescription drugs and the evidence available to the police indicated that he had used razor blades to cause injury to his arms and throat. He underwent medical treatment for a drug overdose and the wounds while he was in the hospital. At the time he was in the hospital, Dr Sinclair described him as being mentally unwell with psychotic features. 
     
      
    12 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour remarked that this was a serious attack upon his wife, that it was the type of offence which of necessity would cause significant problems for the victim as was borne out by the Victim Impact Statement and she would suffer significant amount of distress and pain as a result of it. His Honour noted that the applicant was 69 years of age at the time of the offence and 70 at the time of sentencing, that he was otherwise a highly respected member of the community with no previous convictions of any kind, that he had pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial, and was thus entitled to discount not only on account of utilitarian value of the plea, but also because the plea constituted an expression of remorse.  
     
      
    13 He noted a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Carne to the effect that the applicant was suffering from a level of distress which could be categorised as a mental disorder, and he concluded that the reason for the commission of the offence was the emotional distress that the applicant was under and the fact that something on this particular night caused him to lose control. 
     
      
    14 He also noted that the applicant was suffering from significant ill health and that his heart condition had deteriorated whilst in gaol on remand and had necessitated coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He also noted that the Long Bay Hospital report noted other medical conditions which indicated that the applicant was not in robust health and that accordingly, any time he spent in gaol would be more difficult for him than for an “ordinary prisoner”. In considering the non-parole period, his Honour said that because of the applicant’s age, his ill-health and because there appeared to be a significant psychological fragility, there was a basis for disturbing the statutory ratio and finding special circumstances.  
     
      
    15 His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not believe in the circumstances of this case, that should be a significant disturbance of the ratio, but it is apparent that the prisoner’s psychological state has been very fragile over a significant period of time and that that is really what gave rise to the commission of the offence, and it is clear on that basis, that when he is released from prison, he will need some significant assistance to re-adjust into the community”. 
        
       
      
    16 Two grounds of appeal were argued. The first was that the sentencing judge failed sufficiently to vary the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence.  
     
      
    17 In support of this ground, it was submitted that his Honour erred in holding that notwithstanding his finding that “special circumstances” exercised, there should not be “ a significant disturbance” in the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence specified in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 s 44, and that this error had come about by approaching the question of special circumstances by reference only to whether the applicant would on his release require some significant assistance to re-adjust into the community. 
     
      
    18 It was also submitted that whilst considerations of general deterrence justified a severe head sentence, the age, prior good character, psychological fragility and poor health of the applicant supported a further reduction in the non-parole period. Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 was relied on to support the proposition that, although the same considerations apply to fixing the non-parole period as apply to fixing the head sentence, they do not carry the same weight and while general deterrence is particularly relevant to fixing the head sentence, personal matters favourable to the offender, including prospects of rehabilitation, assume greater relevance in fixing the non-parole period. 
     
      
    19 A similar submission was expressly rejected by this Court in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, 53 NSWLR 704 at [63]-[64] where Spigelman CJ pointed out that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence and noted that considerations of general deterrence are at least equally significant in both decisions which are, in any event, interrelated. See also R v M A [2004] NSWCCA 92 at [33]. Moreover as also noted by the Chief Justice in Simpson at [67] that where a circumstance is taken into account by way of reduction of head sentence, the application of the statutory proportion will have the result that the circumstance also reduces the non-parole period, and it appears from his Remarks on Sentence that his Honour took the applicant’s age, ill health and mental state into account in fixing the head sentence. 
     
      
    20 I reject the submission that his Honour approached the question of special circumstances by reference only to whether the applicant would on his release require some significant assistance to re-adjust into the community. In his Remarks on Sentence at p 6, his Honour expressly based his finding of special circumstances on the applicant’s age, ill health and a significant degree of psychological fragility. The passage quoted above, referring to the need for significant assistance to re-adjust, was in its context only referring to the effect of the finding of special circumstances, not the reason for such finding. 
     
      
    21 Having regard to the fact that it is now established that a finding of “special circumstances” can encompass all relevant factors: Simpson at [73], I cannot see why such a finding should necessarily require in every case a “significant disturbance” in the statutory proportion; but in any event, although the reduction in the present case may not appear substantial when expressed as “only 6 months”, it in fact constituted a reduction from 75% of the head sentence to 66% thereof, which in my opinion is a substantial disturbance with the statutory proportion. I have difficulty in seeing how the non-parole period could be any less in the circumstances of this case where the applicant fired a pistol at the head of his estranged wife until it discharged, and then, without showing any remorse or rendering any assistance, belted her a number of times with a lamp stand causing the injuries detailed above. 
     
      
    22 The second ground of appeal is that new evidence establishes that the applicant’s medical condition is more serious than appreciated at the date of sentencing. 
     
      
    23 There was before the learned sentencing judge, apart from the psychiatric report from Dr Carne, a report from Dr Varga of Long Bay Hospital dated 20 March 2001 to which the applicant was admitted on 19 January 2001 following his arrest and a period of observation in Prince of Wales Hospital following his suicide attempt. The report detailed the applicant’s past medical history as including renal calculi, polyarthritis, ischaemic heart disease and crush fractures of the upper lumbar vertebrae suffered in a motor vehicle accident a few years previously. The report noted that on 23 January 2001, he developed acute chest pain due to acute coronary insufficiency which resulted in him undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery at Prince of Wales Hospital. From this he made a good recovery and he was returned to Long Bay Hospital on 12 February 2001. 
     
      
    24 On the appeal, Senior Counsel for the applicant sought to read an affidavit by his instructing solicitor annexing a copy of a report by Dr M Geoffrey Miller dated 30 November 2003. The Crown Prosecutor objected to admission of this report but in case it was admitted sought to read the affidavit of her instructing solicitor annexing a report from Dr Jill Roberts of Corrections Health Service, with a number of test results annexed thereto. 
     
      
    25 The Court provisionally admitted both affidavits on the basis that it would consider their contents to determine whether they should be admitted as fresh evidence, or only in the event that the appeal was successful on other grounds and the Court came to re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
    26 Dr Miller obtained a detailed history from the applicant which disclosed that his heart disease had been present for many years and he had been advised to have a coronary bypass on 2 previous occasions but had declined. He also noted that the applicant had suffered from gastro-oesophageal disease for many years, that osteoporosis was diagnosed on 15 January 2003 and mild hypertension on 2 June 2003 and also mild Renal Artery Stenosis on 29 April 2003. He noted that his heart disease prevents him walking more than short distances. 
     
      
    27 He agreed that the report from Dr Varga which was before the sentencing judge, correctly set out the applicant’s condition except that it did not go into detail of the applicant’s reduced effort tolerance to less than 100 metres walking on the flat, that he had been advised on two previous occasions to have coronary bypass surgery, nor did it refer to his bladder problems with frequency and nocturia since the early 1900’s. 
     
      
    28 He expressed the opinion (although he had not seen the applicant previously) that whilst in prison his cardiac condition had significantly deteriorated, he had developed renal artery stenosis and difficulty controlling his hypertension, an overactive thyroid condition and peripheral artery disease. Also his rheumatoid arthritis had deteriorated. 
     
      
    29 Dr Roberts’ report set out the medical facilities provided for prisoners in Correctional Centres and detailed the progress of the applicant during his incarceration, including the results of a number of tests which had been carried out during that period. Her concluding remarks were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “This patient certainly has significant health problems that will require monitoring, medication and specialist review. His main health problems that have had recent deterioration are his rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid problems, which I feel are being appropriately managed by the relevant specialist clinics. His cardiac condition has been reasonably stable. Clinic Staff advise me that they have observed gradual deterioration in his mobility with the need to stop and rest after walking approximately 50 metres. 
        
       
       
        
        It is unlikely that Mr Mioduszewski’s condition with respect to his cardiac disease will improve past the benefits already attained through his bypass graft operation and this operation does not eliminate the possibility of further cardiac problems in the future. He will require continued support by both general and specialist medical practitioners. Additionally, he will continue to require multiple medications to maintain medical stability”. 
        
       
      
    30 Generally, evidence of events subsequent to the passing of sentence are not admissible in appeals against the sentence unless the Court upholds the appeal and comes to re-sentence. As Loveday J pointed out in R v Ehrenburg (unrep – CCA – 14 December 1990) at p 5 this is because the Court may only quash a sentence and pass a fresh sentence in substitution therefore if it has been made to appear that the sentence which had been passed was not warranted in law and should not have been passed: Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3). It is the responsibility of the executive government to provide for the care and treatment of prisoners: R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR 351 at 353-4 and the Court will not review sentences in the light of the hardship suffered in prison by prisoners on account of their medical condition: ibid. See also R v Jones (1993) 70 A Crim R 449. 
     
      
    31 There are exceptions to this rule include cases where subsequent events make known or explain something that was either unknown or not fully appreciated at the time of sentencing: R v Bradley [2004] NSWCCA 88, R v Spagnolo (2000) 114 A Crim R 98, or where the circumstances demonstrate that the sentence is being served in conditions much more onerous than, or sufficiently different in nature from, those which were expected: R v Jenkins (unrep – CCA – 14 July 1993).  
     
      
    32 In R v Keir [2004] NSWCCA 106, the sentencing judge had heard evidence of the facilities available for accommodation for the aged and infirm applicant within the prison system, but the evidence submitted on the appeal disclosed that he had been incarcerated in very different and more onerous conditions than had been described. The Court admitted the evidence because it disclosed that the sentence being served was materially different to the sentence which the judge envisaged when passing it, but described the circumstances at [81] as “wholly exceptional”, and intervened “in order to ensure that the sentencing regime contemplated by the trial judge was not thwarted and to ensure that there was no injustice as a result”. 
     
      
    33 Another case where the prisoner did not receive the medical assessment and treatment which was envisaged, and where, although the judge appreciated that the applicant’s time in gaol would be had, he could not and did not appreciate how hard it would be was R v B E G [2001] NSWCCA 341. As Smart AJ said at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The effect of the post sentence events is to underline what was not fully appreciated at the time of sentencing, namely that it would be difficult if not practically impossible, to manage the applicant’s condition adequately in gaol.” 
        
       
      
    34 The effect of the authorities is that this Court can only intervene on account of subsequent events where the basis on which the sentence is passed is completely undermined by the subsequent events. 
     
      
    35 In the present case, the matters disclosed in Dr Miller’s report, with the exception of the bladder problems, are essentially the deterioration of conditions which were present and disclosed to the sentencing judge, and which his Honour anticipated. He specifically noted that the applicant had been suffering significant ill health, that his heart problems became significant after he was removed to gaol and that he had needed a coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  
     
      
    36 He also noted there were a number of other medical problems all of which indicated that the prisoner was in bad health and that any time he spend in gaol would be more difficult for him than for an ordinary prisoner, as indeed would be the case in any event for a 70 year old man, who had never been to prison before. His Honour made allowance for these matters in terms of the sentence he imposed, and the applicant’s ill health was one of the specific matters that he referred to in finding “special circumstance”. 
     
      
    37 Dr Roberts states at the end of her report that there has been no significant deterioration in relation to the applicant’s heart condition except his reduced capacity for walking without fatigue, and this has been confirmed by a number of tests. She notes that his main health problems that have recently deteriorated have been his rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid problems, in respect of which he is being treated within the gaol system. 38 In my opinion, the material disclosed in the affidavits discloses no more than the natural deterioration of a 70 year old man with heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis and other problems, all of which his Honour took into account in imposing the sentence he did, but they do not disclose the type of exceptional circumstance referred to in Jenkins or Keir, which would justify this Court receiving evidence of matters subsequent to the imposition of the sentence.  
     
      
    39 For these reasons, I would reject the affidavits of David Philip Giddy and Adelle Hudson, I would extend the time for filing the Application for Leave to Appeal and grant leave for appeal, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    40 HOWIE J: I agree with Dunford J. I would simply by way of emphasis refer to the following passage from R v Ashton (2002) 137 A Crim R 73 as to the exceptional nature of the Court’s power to receive evidence of post-sentencing events. 
     
      
       
        
        10. “The basis of the application made to this Court is what is said to be fresh evidence relating to the applicant’s psychiatric state at the time of sentence. In this regard reliance is placed upon the decisions of this Court in  
        Bailey 
         (1988) 35 A Crim R 458 and  
        R v Ehrenberg 
         (NSWCCA, unreported, 14 December 1990). There is a firmly established principle that this Court will allow evidence to be introduced of events subsequent to the imposition of sentence concerning the physical or mental condition of the applicant where the existence or effect of that condition was unknown or not fully appreciated at the time sentence was passed. In  
        Bailey 
         the material related to the applicant having been diagnosed with the AIDS virus, a fact that was unknown at the date of sentence. In  
        Ehrenberg 
         it was the birth of a deformed child to the applicant as a result of complications of her pregnancy. In both cases the fresh material indicated that prison would impact more harshly upon the applicant than was thought to be the case when the applicant was sentenced. 
         
         
        11. However, this Court must be careful to maintain a principled approach in dealing with appeals before it. The Court should be scrupulous to ensure that there is a proper basis for receiving evidence of events that occurred after sentence where there is no error established in the sentence imposed. In  
        Ehrenberg 
        , the Court emphasised the special and unusual circumstances that would permit such evidence to be received and acted upon in order to reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence. Loveday J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, stated: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          It must be stressed, however, this is a most unusual case. It will be unfortunate if the special facts and circumstances of this case, which I regard as borderline, were to be regarded as a general precedent for the review of a sentence by this court in the light of subsequent events. Such a course is, as it has always been, a matter for the executive government (see  
          R 
           v  
          Munday 
           (1981) 2 NSWLR 177). 
           
          
         
        Samuels JA, while also agreeing with Justice Loveday, cautioned against this Court erring in principle as a result of sympathy for the applicant.”

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of sentences imposed by Adams J on 3 December 2003. Notice of appeal was filed and served on the respondent on 10 December 2003. For a series of crimes an effective overall sentence of sixteen years eight months with a non parole period of eleven years six months was imposed.  
     
      
    2 The chronicle of the respondent’s offences commenced on 7 May 2001 when he broke and entered house premises at Ashbury by smashing an entry door. He stole electric and electronic equipment valued at $6,300. He apparently injured himself in gaining entry and later a blood deposit was found to match DNA database information concerning him. Arising out of this an offence of breaking, entering and stealing was sought to be, and was taken into account in the sentencing proceedings in respect of which this appeal is concerned by the respondent’s completion of an appropriate Form 1. 
     
      
    3 At the time of this and all other relevant offences, the respondent was on parole following conviction for other offences of breaking, entering and stealing at Sydney District Court on 10 February 2000. His parole expiry date was scheduled for 28 January 2002.  
     
      
    4 On 29 June 2001 the respondent broke into premises at Ryde by using a jemmy on the front door. The whole premises were ransacked and electrical, camera and house entertainment items valued at approximately $20,000 were stolen. Also taken was a bank access card. Later that day the respondent’s image was captured on an ATM surveillance video as he withdrew $1,500 by use of the stolen card. Offences of breaking, entering and stealing and dishonestly obtaining money by deception were included on the Form 1 which the respondent signed. 
     
      
    5 On 11 July 2001 in company with another male the respondent, whilst armed with a .45 calibre colt pistol, robbed jewellery and money from shop premises at Hurlstone Park. Whilst making an escape, the respondent fired a shot into the air from his pistol. A charge of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon was the second count in the indictment presented against the respondent. 
     
      
    6 At 2.20 am on Thursday 19 July 2001 the respondent, again in company with another male, entered the Taverner’s Hotel at Leichhardt. The respondent was armed with a .45 calibre colt pistol (subsequently demonstrated to be that which he used in the robbery at Hurlstone Park) and his companion was armed with a knife. Their faces were concealed by beanies and masks in the fashion of balaclavas. They proceeded to use the weapons to persuade the hotel staff to hand over cash. Patrons who were present were ordered to lie on the floor. The respondent was distracted by a female patron who was refusing to do so and this enabled a male patron to pick up a stool and strike the respondent about the head with it. The offenders fled. Mr Mark Jackson, an off duty manager of the hotel, pursued the respondent and caught him. A struggle ensued. The respondent fired two shots at Mr Jackson, the second of which struck him in the chest. He died on 19 July.  
     
      
    7 The offenders escaped but abandoned a number of items including the pistol and a glove. DNA detected on that glove provided a match with the profile of the respondent which was entered on a database. The first count in the indictment charged the murder of Mr Jackson.  
     
      
    8 On Friday 10 August 2001 the respondent and another man were seen by police in the Petersham area. They entered a Nissan Bluebird sedan which was subsequently identified as a stolen vehicle. The respondent occupied the driver’s seat and drove off. A police vehicle commenced to follow it. Obviously the respondent became aware of this and the stolen vehicle accelerated past a red traffic control signal and moved at high speed through busy commercial and residential areas. Eventually police located it stationary at an intersection and they alighted from their car and surrounded the stolen vehicle with their weapons drawn. The respondent moved his vehicle backwards and forwards on many occasions, steering it at the armed police who were of course on foot and seeking to arrest him. The respondent then mounted the vehicle onto a footpath, manoeuvred it through light poles narrowly missing other pedestrians, and departed the area by driving on the incorrect side of the carriageway. 
     
      
    9 At 12.25 am the next morning police from the State Protection Group entered a boarding house at Petersham and evacuated the occupants. However, an observer in a helicopter noticed someone fleeing across rooftops. The police mounted onto the roofs and arrested the respondent there. Arising out of these events, offences of stealing a motor vehicle and using an offensive weapon to avoid apprehension were also included on the Form 1.  
     
      
    10 The learned judge structured the sentences by imposing imprisonment for thirteen years eight months with a non parole period of eight years six months dating from 10 August 2004 on the count of murder and imprisonment for six years with a non parole period of four years six months dating from 10 August 2001 on the count of armed robbery. The five offences on the Form 1 were taken into account in the latter imposition.  
     
      
    11 The Crown makes two express challenges in respect of matters found by his Honour and elaborated in his remarks on sentence. It is convenient to deal first with these. The matters are related.  
     
      
    12 The respondent had pleaded not guilty on arraignment for murder and a trial was fixed to begin on 14 April 2003. It apparently did not commence on that date, however on 17 April 2003 his legal representatives advised his intention to plead guilty and he did so on 22 April 2003.  
     
      
    13 His Honour was not prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Jackson but he rejected a submission that the firing of the gun was “in substance, accidental”. He found, more probably than not, “that the trigger was pulled almost reflexively during the struggle but the gun discharged because the offender had intentionally cocked it in the hope that this would frighten off his attackers”. The “attackers” were those persons, including Mr Jackson, who were seeking to detain the armed robber. The crime had yielded just under $5,000 in loot. The Crown challenges the finding that the respondent fired the weapon in some reflex fashion. 
     
      
    14 The allied challenge is to a finding by his Honour that the Crown accepted that it was a fact that the respondent did not intend to kill or do grievous bodily harm to Mr Jackson. 
     
      
    15 The respondent gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Counsel then appearing for the respondent is recorded as being interrupted by his Honour as he commenced to refer to “what happened when the gun discharged” by a comment that the prosecutor did not (cross) examine him to suggest that he intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm and his Honour added “I take it on the basis of the plea as agreed is felony murder”. 
     
      
    16 The Crown Prosecutor responded that he chose not “to canvass it” because he intended to submit that felony murder was no less culpable than other forms of murder, that is intentional killing or killing when grievous bodily harm was intended.  
     
      
    17 This led to what the transcript conveys as the appearance of debate in which counsel for the respondent joined in.  
     
      
    18 The learned judge observed that he would regard it as “far more wicked to blindly (as transcribed) kill” than to do so when one had not thought about it. His concluding remark was that this Court had considered that in some cases of felony murder, sentence might be just as great as sentence for other forms of murder. The Crown Prosecutor said that he did not want to argue with that but in response to a specific question whether he wished to contend that the respondent intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, he responded affirmatively. His Honour then said that if it was desired to cross examine the respondent, he would give leave so to do. This provoked an objection by counsel for the respondent who argued that there was an agreement that the basis of the plea of guilty was that the respondent was liable for felony murder. The debate continued and the Crown Prosecutor adopted the position that, whilst it was true that in discussions with his colleague he had indicated that he had intended to “run the case” as felony murder, he had not abandoned the assertion of intentional killing although the discussions had not reached the stage of his being asked to make a decision about such an assertion. 
     
      
    19 In the event the respondent was not recalled for cross examination. 
     
      
    20 The references to these exchanges are not intended to suggest that remarks by a sentencing judge in the course of argument are revelatory of the process of reasoning in the same way as remarks on sentence can be examined for that purpose, but to demonstrate that the Crown expressly did not accept as a fact that the respondent did not intend to kill or cause previous bodily harm. His Honour’s statement to the contrary was incorrect. 
     
      
    21 It is further argued that it was not reasonably open on the evidence nor on his Honour’s analysis to find that the respondent pulled the trigger “almost reflexively”. As already mentioned, he rejected the submission that the firing was accidental but “almost reflexively” would seem to convey something less than deliberately. Senior counsel appearing for the respondent in the appeal (who did not appear in the sentencing proceedings) suggested that the expression might be taken to mean “without adverting to the consequences”. 
     
      
    22 The evidence that the discharge of the weapon was deliberate was incontrovertible. Passages in the respondent’s evidence quoted by his Honour in his remarks on sentence include concession that the respondent knew the safety was engaged before he entered the hotel and that when he was in the street being (as he put it) kicked and punched, he cocked the pistol and loaded the round. His suggestion that he thought that his assailants would stop when they heard the cocking of the weapon might be assessed as bordering upon absurdity, but it implies nevertheless a consciousness of his actions at the time.  
     
      
    23 It might be observed that when interviewed by police on 15 August 2001 the respondent described firing two shots and indicated that the muzzle of the weapon was about eight inches from Mr Jackson’s body at the time of discharge. Forensic examination described the pistol as a self loading type which required a force of 1.82 kilogrammes (17.88 newtons) to cause the trigger mechanism to function in single action mode. The concessions by the respondent are in harmony with a comment by his Honour to counsel that his “clear view of (the respondent’s) evidence was that he knew very well that he was firing that gun”. Counsel for the respondent said that he didn’t “resile from that”. Those observations are compatible with the indisputable fact that the respondent fired the pistol twice, a circumstance which is contradictory of a notion that the respondent fired “almost reflexively”.  
     
      
    24 Both of the Crown’s contentions are made out. The Crown did not accept that its assertion of felony murder excluded contention that the respondent intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The evidence did not sustain a finding that the firing of the pistol by the respondent was “almost reflexive”.  
     
      
    25 There was little of a subjective nature to assist the respondent. His Honour noted the aggravating feature of the commission of offences whilst on parole. A criminal record, described by his Honour as “a bad one”, was a counter to leniency although he assessed the crimes on the current indictment as more serious by a considerable margin than anything on his record. It is disturbing however to note the recurrence on the record of offences involving firearms, two counts of possessing shortened firearms and a further similar charge taken into account on a schedule in 1993, possession of a prohibited weapon in 1996 and possession of weapons (not particularized) in Queensland in 1999. His Honour noted that the respondent was a long term user of illicit drugs and was afflicted by hepatitis. The respondent is not youthful being now thirty nine years of age (date of birth, 5 March 1965). 
     
      
    26 What could be taken into account to ameliorate sentence included the pleas of guilty although offered some time after early opportunity in the case of murder, but very promptly in the case of the charge of armed robbery. Although initial contact with police involved prevarication about the murder the respondent was later candid with them and the delayed plea of guilty was consistent with that change. His Honour found this candour to be prompted to a significant degree by genuine feelings of remorse and contrition.  
     
      
    27 Importantly, the respondent offered, and confirmed the offer in his evidence, to testify against his co-offender who was, he said, the same person involved in both the robbery at Hurlstone Park and the murder at the hotel in Leichhardt. A collateral consequence was the likelihood of his own custody in circumstances of protection. His custody up to the time of appearance for sentence had been in protection at Parklea and later in the Special Purposes Prison at Long Bay.  
     
      
    28 His Honour, rightly in my view, attached significance to the offers of the respondent to assist in the prosecution of his co-offender. It was not possible for his Honour to assess the usefulness of the assistance (see s 23(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) other than in a predictive way. At the hearing of the appeal the Court was informed that the co-offender had not to that point been charged in respect of the armed robbery at Hurlstone Park and that, upon indictment he had pleaded guilty to murder but later was permitted to withdraw that plea. A subsequent trial concluded with discharge of the jury which was unable to agree upon verdict. The evidence of the respondent was said to have extended over five days. On the count of murder his Honour determined an application of a “discount” of 35 percent for the combined factors of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty and the assistance to authority by the offer to testify in the trial of his alleged co-offender. It can be calculated therefore by extrapolation from the sentence of thirteen years and eight months that the “starting point” was twenty one years imprisonment. On the count of armed robbery, in respect of which the plea of guilty was prompt and the respondent had indicated his willingness to testify if required, his Honour applied “a discount” of 40 percent. The “starting point” can be calculated as ten years imprisonment. That sentence was required to take into account the unrelated matters scheduled in the Form 1. 
     
      
    29 In addition to these discounts, the impositions were made partially concurrent so that, in practical effect, the head sentence of six years for the armed robbery added only three years to the sentence for the murder.  
     
      
    30 In my opinion, the Crown’s contention that the overall effective head sentence of sixteen years eight months was disproportionate to the circumstances and manifestly inadequate has been made out. 
     
      
    31 As recognized by his Honour, an absence of intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm does not necessarily mean that responsibility on the basis of felony murder is less serious: R v Mills, unreported, NSWCCA 3 April 1995. In this instance, setting aside the notion that the firing of the pistol (twice) was some form of reflex action and recognizing the deliberate disarming of the safety mechanism and the proximity of the victim to the muzzle of the weapon, I conclude that this was a crime, the seriousness of which is at least at the level of responsibility for murder on the basis of specific intent. 
     
      
    32 I have already sketched the facts of all the crimes which were to be reflected in the overall sentence. They reveal persistent criminal conduct of a very high level of seriousness. The murder was committed in the course of an armed robbery which as an independent offence carries a prescribed maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment as well as providing an ingredient for liability for the murder. The robbery demonstrates a planned engagement in serious crime irrespective of what circumstances led to the use of the loaded weapon which the respondent had brought to the scene to facilitate criminal endeavour. 
     
      
    33 For the purpose of resentence, there has been received an affidavit by the respondent setting out some detail of his history concerning drugs, early life, contact with paedophiles and the circumstances of his incarceration to date. The content of the affidavit is taken into consideration. 
     
      
    34 Dealing first with the crime of murder, aggravated by being committed whilst the respondent was on parole, assessment of twenty five years head sentence should be made. That assessment takes into account the restraint applicable to resentence following successful Crown appeal. I would regard the “discount” of 35 percent as extremely generous but I would not intervene having regard to the discretionary nature of his Honour’s conclusion on that aspect. The consequent head sentence would be sixteen years and three months imprisonment. 
     
      
    35 The assessment of ten years imprisonment for the armed robbery reduced by 40 percent for early plea of guilty of murder and offer of assistance is, viewed in insolation, extremely lenient. Its contribution to the manifest inadequacy of the overall imposition is placed into stark relief by the order that half of it be served concurrently with the sentence for murder.  
     
      
    36 However, if the sentence for armed robbery as assessed was allowed to stand, there would be no good reason for an order for concurrent service in whole or in part. Refraining from so ordering would avoid disproportion in ultimate sentence viewed against the total criminality of the offences. 
     
      
    37 I am unpersuaded that the prospect that custody in circumstances of protection nor any other factor amounts to special circumstances leading to variation of the statutory formula for specification of non parole period.  
     
      
    38 I conclude that this Court should resentence and I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentences imposed in the Supreme Court quashed.  
       
      3. In lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced as follows: 
       
       
        
        (a) On the count of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, to imprisonment for six years commencing on 10 August 2001 and expiring on 9 August 2007 with a non parole period of four years and six months commencing on 10- August 2001 and expiring on 9 February 2006. 
         
        (b) On the count of murder, to imprisonment for sixteen years and three months commencing on 10 February 2006 and expiring on 9 May 2022 with a non parole period of twelve years two months commencing on 10 February 2006 and expiring on 9 April 2018.  
        
       
       
      4. The earliest date of eligibility for release specified as 9 April 2018.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal against the sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Urquhart QC in the District Court of Sydney on 19 June 2003, following the applicant pleading guilty to one count of assault police whilst in the execution of his duty contrary to s 60(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, and two counts of break, enter and steal contrary to s 112 of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.  
     
      
    2 The facts in relation to the charge of assault police were that the applicant made a series of offensive comments towards police officers who were on patrol in Darlinghurst Road, Darlinghurst on 4 October 2001. The police were not wearing uniforms and told the applicant to move on. He then ran towards them with his right arm extended holding a silver object. The police identified themselves and used capsicum spray in the direction of the applicant, whereupon he turned and ran away. They chased him and after he was tackled and subdued, when again capsicum spray had to be used, the silver object was found to be a 26cm long screwdriver. The police were fearful for their safety.  
     
      
    3 Following his arrest, the applicant was released on bail but did not appear on 20 December 2001 in relation to that matter and a warrant was issued for his arrest, meanwhile, he remained at large. The first of the break, enter and steal offences was committed on 8 January 2002, when the applicant between 8:30am and 12:50pm, kicked in a rear door of premises, smashed a glass panel and entered premises at 30 Womerah Avenue, Darlinghurst and stole a computer, camera, money, a video player, a DVD player, a quantity of jewellery and other personal effects to a total value of $13,602. On the kitchen floor of the premises some drops of blood were located and a tissue with blood on it was also found inside the premises. A DNA analysis identified the blood as being that of the applicant. The applicant was arrested on other matters on 12 April 2002, and again admitted to bail on 20 May 2002. 
     
      
    4 Then on 11 July 2002 between 10am and 1:15pm, he broke into premises at 24 George Street, Paddington via a ground floor window. The glass window panel had been smashed and the window opened. Items stolen from those premises were a television set and a camera to the total value of $210. This matter was taken into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s 262 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in relation to the sentencing for the break, enter and steal at Darlinghurst on 8 January 2001. 
     
      
    5 Finally, about 8:15am and 12 midday on 30 August 2002, the applicant went to premises in Brooke Street, Naremburn where he took a chisel from a shed located at the premises, which he then used to open a ground floor window at the rear of the house. He then entered the premises and stole an X-box games system, 3 X-box games and a large number of DVD’s to the total value of $3000.  
     
      
    6 Later that day, he went to the premises of NN Cash Controllers in George Street, Sydney and sold one of the X-box systems and two hand controllers for an X-box system for $130 in cash. In doing so, he endorsed the relevant pledge with his signature claiming to be the lawful owner of the property. In respect of this he was charged with making a false statement to a pawnbroker contrary to s 24 Pawnbrokers and Second-Hand Dealers Act 1996. This matter was taken into account in considering the charge of break, enter and steal at Naremburn.  
     
      
    7 He was re-arrested pursuant to the warrant on 24 September 2003, and remained in custody since that date. 
     
      
    8 The sentences imposed were as follows: 
     
      
       
      i. On the charge of assault police officer: imprisonment for 18 months commencing 24 September 2002 and expiring 23 March 2004, with a non-parole period of 9 months expiring 23 June 2003. 
       
       
      ii. On the charge of break, enter and steal on 8 January 2002: imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months from 24 June 2003 to 23 December 2007, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 23 December 2005. 
       
       
      iii. On the charge of break, enter and steal on 13 August 2002: imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months to commence from 24 December 2004 and to expire 23 June 2009, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months expiring on 23 June 2007. 
       
       
      The overall effective term was imprisonment for 6 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months. 
       
      
    9 The applicant was born in New Zealand on 23 December 1967 and was aged 35 at the time of sentencing. He came to Australia with his family at the age of seven and the family settled in Maroubra. He did his School Certificate and spent approximately 4 years doing a carpentry joinery course, during which time he completed an apprenticeship. He then worked full time in different employments until about 1994 or 1995. He had an extensive criminal record going back to 1987 which included, on my calculation, 5 convictions for break, enter and steal or attempt the same, 17 convictions for stealing in various forms, 10 convictions for goods in custody and 3 convictions for assault and/or resist arrest. In addition, he had convictions for malicious damage, receiving, possessing housebreaking implements, possess prohibited drug and escape lawful custody.  
     
      
    10 In respect of all his previous offences he had been dealt with in the Local Court and had received recognisances, fines, community service orders and 8 discreet sentences of full time custody, the longest of which was for a term of 9 months minimum term with an additional term of 3 months. He was last released from custody on 30 July 2001 and the first of these offences was committed just over 2 months later on 4 October 2001, that is the assault police. All the offences except the assault police were committed whilst on bail or an absconder therefrom. 
     
      
    11 The applicant married when he was about 21 years of age and on that marriage there was one child, a daughter now 12-13 years old, but the marriage broke up and this was followed by custody hearings in relation to the child in the Family Court of Australia. He had a second relationship which lasted 3-4 years which produced a son but that relationship also broke down on account of his drug addiction. At the time of sentencing, he was in another relationship and his partner was pregnant, but had made it clear the relationship would not continue after his release from prison unless he ceased his drug use. 
     
      
    12 He began consuming alcohol at the age of 19 years but only drank socially until the court hearings began in regard to his daughter’s custody at which stage he was drinking heavily for about 6 months, after which he ceased drinking and became addicted to drugs. He had commenced using cannabis at the age of 17 but stopped using it after about two years. When he stopped drinking alcohol, he began using cocaine and heroin and became addicted to those substances.  
     
      
    13 He has previously attempted rehabilitation pursuant to, or in accordance with, an order of a court and has been to Odyssey House, the Westside Mission and the William Booth Institute, but he said these attempts had not been successful because when he was released to those programs, he was on methadone in each case, and was unable to promote his own cause sufficiently to prevent him from returning to drugs.  
     
      
    14 But he also said that since being returned to custody in September 2002, he had not taken or used any illicit drugs although they were available to him, he was not on a methadone program and does not wish to be on such a program, and reference was made to his acceptance for a residential drug rehabilitation program at The Glen. 
     
      
    15 It was conceded by the Crown that the applicant had pleaded guilty to the various offences at the earliest opportunity, and his Honour accepted that the applicant was sincere in his expressions of contrition and remorse and, noted the applicant’s wish and desire to be free and clean of drugs. He found that his motivation not to re-offend was both sincere and strong.  
     
      
    16 In the light of that evidence, his Honour accepted that this could be a turning point in his life notwithstanding his previous criminal antecedents. His Honour had regard to the fact that he was at that stage serving his sentence in what was described as “strict protection”, his pleas of guilty, his sincerity and motivation, his desire for rehabilitation and the principles of totality, and allowed a discount of 25 percent for all aspects of the pleas of guilty on each charge and found special circumstances in the sincerity of his remorse and his motivation for rehabilitation. He then made his sentence for the first break and enter cumulative on the non-parole period for the assault police charge and the sentence for the second break and enter partially cumulative on the sentence for the first break and enter charge, with the results I have indicated above.  
     
      
    17 These were all serious offences. In Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 2 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 515 at para [26] the Court said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The authority of the police, in the performance of their duties, must be supported by the Courts. 
         
         
        In cases involving assaults against police, there is a need to give full weight to the objective of general deterrence and accordingly, sentences at the high end of the scale, pertinent in the light of all the circumstances are generally appropriate in such cases”.  
         
        
       
      In my view, the sentence of two years or the discount of 25 percent for the plea of guilty was not excessive.  
       
      
    18 As to the sentences for the break, enter and steal offences, I refer to the Attorney General’s Application [No 1] under s 26 of the Criminal Procedure Act, R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435, 48 NSWLR 327, a guideline judgment in respect of this type of offence. At para [48], the Court drew attention to a number of features which aggravate the objective seriousness of such offences and need to be taken into account, some of which apply here including that the offences were committed whilst the offender was on bail (or an absconder therefrom), his prior record particularly for like offences, the offences were accompanied by significant damage to property, the multiplicity of offences and the value of the property stolen. In addition, there were the matters to be taken into account on the Forms 1: See Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518, 56 NSWLR 146 particularly at para [42]. In respect of these matters, his Honour took a starting point of 6 years for each charge which he reduced to 4 ½ years on account of the pleas of guilty and then made the sentences partly concurrent to each other, but wholly cumulative on the sentence for assault police to give effect to the principles of totality. 
     
      
    19 Having regard to the disparate nature of the offences and the need to protect the authority of the police, I can see no error in making the sentences for the break, enter and steal offences wholly cumulative on the non-parole period for the assault police. Furthermore, having regard to the fact that the two break, enter and steal offences with the third break, enter and steal offence on one of the Forms 1 relate to three totally separate instances of criminality, I can see no error in making them only partially concurrent with each other. 20 The applicant had an appalling record, but his Honour made favourable findings of a genuine desire to avoid drug use in the future and rehabilitating himself which his Honour, surprisingly in my view, considered has some prospects of success. However, when one looks at the total overall sentences of 6 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months, I have come to the conclusion that in totality such sentences are manifestly excessive and that this Court should re-sentence the applicant.  
     
      
    21 In doing so, I would take into account the material disclosed in the affidavit of the applicant, which discloses that he is now on protection rather than strict protection and although there are apparently some limitations as a result of that classification, he is able to, and has completed courses within the gaol. I would not disturb his Honour’s finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    22 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would not disturb the sentence for the assault police but in respect of each of the break, enter and steal offences and taking into account the matters on the respective Forms 1, I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, the first of those sentences to commence on 24 June 2003 and expire 23 June 2007, with the non-parole period to expire 23 September 2005, and the second of such sentence to commence on 24 June 2004 and expire 23 June 2008, with the non-parole period expiring 23 September 2006. The overall effective term would therefore be imprisonment for 5 years and 9 months, with a total non-parole period of 4 years. The earliest date on which the applicant would be eligible to be released on parole would be 23 September 2006.

      REGINA v Mark Dempsey KNIGHT 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Mark Dempsey Knight, was found guilty by a jury of the murder on 27 March 2000 at Bathurst of Craig Brookes Dally. The offender and the deceased were fellow inmates at Bathurst gaol. Not long before he was killed, the deceased had been transferred to a cell in the wing where the offender was housed. On the morning of the day of his death the deceased told a friend of his that he wished urgently to move back to the wing he had previously occupied. He said that he was sick and tired of being “hit up” by kooris for tobacco. The offender is a member of the Aboriginal race, but the deceased did not mention his name. Apparently there were other Aborigines in the same wing. 
     
      
    2 The offender and at least one other inmate entered the deceased’s cell and stabbed him repeatedly with a sharp instrument. There were twenty identifiable stab wounds to the neck, chest and abdomen. Three closely grouped wounds in about the middle of the chest were probably the most serious. The deepest of them was eighty-five millimetres long and damaged the heart and the aorta. The deceased put up a struggle. All over his hands, fingers and forearms were wounds his attackers caused as he tried to defend himself. During the attack the offender’s right hand was pierced through and bled freely onto the floor of the deceased’s cell and the boots the offender and a companion were wearing. 
     
      
    3 The offender took part in an interview with the police. He told them that he had entered the deceased’s cell to ask for tobacco. He had seen others in the cell, each of whom he referred to as “old mate”. Part of what he told the police suggested that he had seen two people, part three. He named none of them. He said that one of them had pushed him and had pierced his hand with what he called a “gizmo”. Everything he said was calculated to protect the identity of the attackers and to exculpate himself. The jury rejected that version. 
     
      
    4 The evidence shows that there were at least two attackers. No weapon was found. The number of stab wounds and cuts on the body of the deceased suggests that the attackers had more than one weapon, but it is not possible categorically to say so. The jury were told that they could find the offender guilty if he took part in the attack or was present, assisting or encouraging it or standing by ready to assist. 
     
      
    5 In view of the number of injuries inflicted and the various parts of the cell where the offender was from time to time, judging by the places where his spilt blood was found, the only conclusion I can come to is that he played an active role in the attack. Such an active participation in an armed attack by two men on one encompasses a high degree of criminality. It would be no less even if the offender was not himself armed, such was the role he must have played.  
     
      
    6 There is no evidence why the offender killed the deceased. Even if there was a difference of opinion about tobacco that would scarcely explain such a savage attack.  
     
      
    7 When interviewed by a Probation and Parole officer for the pre-sentence report requested by his counsel, the offender maintained his innocence. He said that he had been framed but declined to discuss the detail of the matter. He added that he was not prepared to put his life at risk by assisting the police.  
     
      
    8 The offender was born on 22 December 1964, so he was thirty-five years old at the time of the offence and is thirty-nine years old now. He was a member of a stable and highly regarded family, originally from Bourke but long time residents of the Wentworth area. According to the pre-sentence report, the members of the offender’s family were law-abiding, progressive members of the community. The offender’s eldest sister is a church minister who has a particular concern for the rehabilitation of offenders after their release from custody. The offender has frequently referred such persons to her for assistance. 
     
      
    9 The offender is described as having been a bright and well adjusted child. He had the advantage of a good upbringing. His family have been surprised and hurt by his offending. They find it difficult to accept that he murdered the deceased. The offender told Ms Robilliard, psychologist, that he had been accelerated through secondary school because he was academically gifted. That put him out of step with his class mates and made him feel ill at ease. He wanted to feel normal and felt pressure to perform well. He responded by becoming lazy. He had a deep interest in music which he wanted to pursue. When he was sixteen years old he was accepted into a music program in Adelaide and began to undertake it, but left after a few weeks because he was homesick. After that he lost his motivation to study and began to take drugs. He has a former partner and two children and keeps in touch with them. He is in regular contact with his parents, brothers and sisters.  
     
      
    10 The offender left school after year ten and did a TAFE course. He has had casual unskilled work. During the 1980s he was dealt with for a number of property offences, probably drug-related, and for the use of drugs. There were also an assault and a number of firearms offences but, judging by the lenient sentences imposed, they were probably not especially serious. During the 1990s he was in Queensland and his family lost touch with him. He was dealt with for a number of drug and drug- related property offences and short terms of imprisonment were imposed. During 1994 he was sentenced to concurrent terms of eighteen months’ imprisonment for breaking, entering and stealing with actual violence while pretending to be armed with a dangerous weapon. In 1995 he was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years for stealing with actual violence while armed with a dangerous weapon. In 1997 he attempted to escape from lawful custody. There were other offences as well. Altogether he has been convicted of eight offences of violence, six of which involved the use of weapons or the pretence of being armed. They included three armed robberies. 
     
      
    11 In 1999 the offender was transferred to the New South Wales prison system to serve the balance of his Queensland sentences in this State. He was awaiting a transfer to Broken Hill Correctional Centre when he murdered the deceased. 
     
      
    12 According to Ms Robilliard the offender is in the upper end of the average range of intelligence. He has a schizoid and anxious personality and is showing avoidant behaviour. He tends to be solitary and private. Ms Robilliard considers that there is no evidence of profound psychopathology of antisocial or aggressive type. However that last opinion may be, I am bound to conclude from the offender’s history and his having committed this offence that he does not hesitate to behave aggressively when it suits him.  
     
      
    13 Mr McDermott, counsel for the offender, drew attention to the special considerations that sometimes accompany the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders. They were set out in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58.  
     
      
    14 I apprehend, however, that those principles are concerned with Aborigines who have been brought up in disadvantaged circumstances, have been denied opportunities to develop knowledge and job training and have been subjected to the evils of alcoholism and the violence which often accompanies it in aboriginal communities. There is no evidence that the offender has suffered disadvantages or deprivation of the kind that prompted the remarks of the Court in Fernando. On the contrary, he had a good start in life with intelligence, good opportunities in school and tertiary courses, all backed up by the support of a fine family. He turned his back on his opportunities and resorted to a life of drugs, dishonesty and violence. He alone is responsible for the decision he made.  
     
      
    15 The murder of the deceased was a wicked and violent act. The offender must have known that that was what he was about when he went to the deceased’s cell. It could not have been any accident that there were a weapon or weapons there with which to attack the deceased. The deceased was outnumbered. The intent was to kill. The attack was sustained and the injuries many. An injury to the neck, which I am satisfied was inflicted after the principal wounds that I have described, slit the throat wide open, severing the major arteries and veins on both sides of the neck and marking the anterior surface of the spinal column. That wound alone bespeaks great savagery. This offence was for these reasons a serious one of its kind. 
     
      
    16 The offender’s statement to the Probation and Parole officer that he would not risk his life to assist the police is a matter of some moment. Although it accompanied an untrue denial of responsibility, I do not doubt that it was true. There is a code of silence which discourages gaol inmates from informing police about crimes committed by other inmates and from giving evidence about them. Those who do risk punishment, perhaps death. As a result, a substantial portion of gaol murders go unsolved.  
     
      
    17 The community has an interest in the rehabilitation of gaol inmates. For that to happen they must be able to serve their sentences safely and constructively. Yet they are particularly vulnerable people. They have no choice about where they live or work. They cannot choose the company they keep. Experience suggests that the system of protection which operates in the gaol system can never be a complete answer to the risk of violence perpetrated by inmates on inmates. It would be impossible to place every inmate on protection. In imposing sentences for offences committed on gaol inmates, the Court must therefore impose salutary sentences calculated to discourage such offences in recognition of the vulnerability of gaol inmates and to promote the community interest in the rehabilitation of offenders.  
     
      
    18 These remarks should not be understood as implying that the sentence I shall impose upon the offender is being increased because he chose not to assist the police. It is being increased because of the special need to discourage the commission of violent offences upon gaol inmates. Nor do I intend to suggest that the deceased was killed because he in some way failed to observe the code of silence. There is no evidence to show why he was killed.  
     
      
    19 The offender is not sorry for what he has done and continues to deny his offence. He appears to have become well established in the gaol system, though I am reluctant to conclude that he may not lead a useful life in the community on his eventual release. By the time he becomes eligible for release on parole he will be almost at the end of middle age. He will be a different man. I would hope that long before parole he would be housed in the far west of New South Wales where he could have the beneficial influence and support of his family. I think that there are some prospects of rehabilitation. 20 It was not submitted that there were circumstances which justified the fixing of a parole period which exceeded one quarter of the head sentence. I do not think that such circumstances exist. I have not overlooked the fact that the sentence I am about to impose will be accumulated on other sentences. Such accumulation sometimes justifies an adjustment of parole and non-parole periods but it does not in the present case because no non-parole period shorter than the one I shall impose would be sufficient to recognise the seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    21 The offence was committed during the non-parole period of the Queensland sentences. They expired on 16 April 2002. On 12 February 2001 the offender escaped a second time from lawful custody and was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term commencing on 19 April 2002 and expiring on 18 January 2003. The parole period of the Queensland sentences is still in force, but as far as I am aware there has been no formal revocation of parole. It would ordinarily have been appropriate, therefore, to commence the sentence from 19 January 2003. However, one of the police officers who had an important part to play in the investigation became too ill to continue with his work, and that may have been the cause of an inordinate delay in the charging of the offender. Although the offence took place in March 2000 he was not arrested and charged until September 2002. Because that delay was no fault of his I have selected a commencement date six months earlier. 22 Mark Dempsey Knight you are sentenced to imprisonment for a period of twenty-two years. Your sentence will be taken to have commenced on 19 July 2002. I fix a non-parole period of sixteen years and six months. You will become eligible for release on parole on 18 January 2019.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an Application for Leave to Appeal under S5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from an interlocutory judgment of Wood CJ at CL. His Honour rejected an application for a stay of the prosecution in relation to the kidnapping and murder of Mrs Whelan. The Applicant seeks a permanent stay or, in the alternative, a temporary stay on the basis of abuse of process. The temporary stay sought would be conditional in that proceedings could be reinstated “if sufficient additional evidence of guilt becomes available”. Mr B Walker SC, who appeared for the Applicant, placed particular reliance on the temporary stay alternative. Furthermore, the Applicant seeks a stay on the basis of actual prejudice based on adverse publicity. Wood CJ at CL refused a stay on both bases. 
     
      
    2 His Honour’s judgment of 19 December 2003 in the matter of Regina v Bruce Burrell, which encompassed issues from which there is no appeal, is the subject of an order by his Honour restricting publication. For that reason it has not been given a medium neutral citation reference. Nor has it been placed on the Supreme Court website.  
     
      
    3 The basic facts are not in issue. They are fully and accurately set out in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL. There has been no challenge to any of his Honour’s findings of fact. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to outline a summary of the basic facts: 
     
      
       
        Mrs Whelan left her home at Kurrajong on 6 May 1997 and after being seen walking out of the Park Royal Hotel carpark in Phillip Street, Parramatta, has not been seen since. 
       
       
        On 1 April 1999, Mr Burrell was arrested and charged with the kidnapping and murder of Mrs Whelan. He was committed for trial and at an arraignment on 5 May 2000, the trial date was fixed for 29 January 2001.  
       
       
        On 29 January 2001 Mr Burrell appeared for trial before Mr Justice Sully of the Supreme Court. A series of voire dire hearings were conducted in relation to various aspects of the evidence. Some of the evidence proposed to be relied upon was rejected by Sully J.  
       
       
        On 1 March 2001, an Application for a nolle prosequi on the part of Mr Burrell was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  
       
       
        On 6 March 2001, the day fixed for trial, a stay application was foreshadowed by Counsel for Mr Burrell. This was adjourned to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider the nolle prosequi application and also to obtain certain DNA tests. 
       
       
        On 14 and 27 March and 4 April 2001 there was correspondence on behalf of Mr Burrell relating to the application. 
       
       
        On 17 April 2001 a nolle prosequi was filed in relation to both counts on the indictment. 
       
       
        On 18 April 2001 the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to the Solicitor for Mr Burrell in terms which I will set out below. 
       
       
        On 19 April 2001 Mr Burrell was discharged. 
       
       
        Between 20 May 2002 and 25 June 2002 an inquest was conducted into the deaths and/or disappearances of Mrs Whelan and another woman, Mrs Davis. I note that an application for leave to appeal from Wood CJ at CL’s judgment refusing a stay in the case of Mrs Davis was discontinued.  
       
       
        On 25 June 2002 the Coroner delivered a report in relation to the inquest to the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
       
       
        On 23 September 2002 the Director of Public Prosecutions filed an ex officio indictment in relation to Mrs Whelan. 
       
      
    4 In his judgment of 19 December 2003, Wood CJ at CL refused the Crown application that the trials with respect to Mrs Davis and Mrs Whelan proceed together. He ruled again on a number of issues of admissibility of disputed evidence which had earlier been considered by Sully J. He rejected stay applications in the case of both the Whelan indictment and the Davis indictment.  
     
      
       
      The Unfairness Issue 
       
      
    5 The principal proposition advanced on the part of the applicant/appellant is that the continuation of the prosecution, or at least its continuation unless sufficient additional evidence of guilt becomes available, constitutes an abuse of process on the basis of a breach of the principle of fairness. Specifically, it is submitted, that the Crown should be held, in the interests of a consistent and disinterested administration of criminal justice, to its earlier representations that unless there was some such additional evidence, proceedings would not be re-instituted.  
     
      
    6 The critical letter was written on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions and is dated 18 April 2001. It said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I wish to advise that after careful consideration of this case, the Director of Public Prosecutions has made the decision to proceed no further on the above outstanding charges. 
        
       
       
        
        Please be advised that the proceedings may be re-instituted if sufficient additional evidence of guilt becomes available”. 
        
       
       
      This letter was forwarded with respect to both the charge of kidnapping and the charge of murder. 
       
      
    7 The abuse of process, it is submitted, is reinforced by the Director’s own published Guidelines with respect to the determination of matters of this character. Those Guidelines include the following paragraph:- 
     
      
       
        
        “3. Where a direction has been given in a matter to proceed or to take no further proceedings, that direction will not be reversed unless significant new facts warrant it, the direction was obtained by fraud or the direction was obtained or made on erroneous material and the interest of justice require a reversal.” 
        
       
      
    8 Mr Walker SC submitted that the combination of these two matters, i.e. the express representation and the general policy, was such that in the circumstances of the present case, including the conduct of an inquest, it would be an abuse of process to permit the proceedings to be reinstituted, at least in the absence of any substantial new evidence. There was, he submitted, a requirement of consistency in the administration of criminal justice. This requirement was reinforced by the principle of disinterestedness on the part of the prosecution. 
     
      
    9 The relevant legal principles were set out by Wood CJ at CL at paragraphs [187]-[203] of his Honour’s Judgment. I incorporate those paragraphs by reference. Mr Walker SC accepted that his Honour accurately stated the relevant legal principles. In particular it was accepted that there was no principle of estoppel in the criminal law, nor were prosecutorial decisions subject to control by the courts. Nevertheless, the interests of consistent and disinterested administration of criminal justice, it was submitted, required that the Director of Public Prosecutions not be permitted to resile from his position with respect to the nolle prosequi in the instant case. 
     
      
    10 The Applicant referred to certain observations of Kirby J in Director of Public Prosecutions South Australia v B (1998) 194 CLR 566 where his Honour said at 603: 
     
      
       
        
        “Short of refusing to accept the entry of a nolle prosequi, a judge could properly make plain an opinion that, in the absence of significantly new evidence, the commencement of such proceedings would constitute an abuse of process”. 
        
       
      
    11 This sentence appears in a context where his Honour was listing, in a dissenting judgment, a number of arguments against the existence of a power in the courts to refuse to accept a nolle prosequi. The introductory words of the sentence: “Short of refusing to accept the entry …” make it clear that the expression of the “opinion” was a matter for the judge at the first abandoned trial. 
     
      
    12 No doubt such an opinion would be a relevant consideration for the judge hearing an application for a stay of a subsequent indictment on the basis of abuse of process. In the present case, Sully J expressed no such opinion. Indeed, it is by no means clear that such an opinion could be properly expressed where, as here, the nolle prosequi was requested by an accused. An accused must be taken to understand the difference between a nolle prosequi and a verdict by direction. (See e.g. Davis v Gall  (1924) 35 CLR 275 at 287; Broome v Chenoweth (1946) 73 CLR 583 at 599; R v Swingler (1995) 80 A Crim R 471 at 479-480; Question of Law Reserved on Acquittal (3 of 1995) (1996) 88 A Crim R 1 at 115-11.) 
     
      
    13 As Wood CJ at CL concluded, the views expressed by Kirby J do not suggest a rule that in the absence of “significantly new evidence” a further prosecution will generally, let alone must, constitute an abuse. 
     
      
    14 Mr Walker SC struggled to identify any relevant error of principle in his Honour’s reasons. He suggested that such does appear in the following passage in his Honour’s judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “[218]. The decision, in the present case, to re-initiate the proceedings was made by the Director following the Inquest, and in the expectation that several items of evidence previously examined could be properly tendered. It cannot be said that those items, which I have ruled to be inadmissible have no probative value, their exclusion having been determined by my assessment of their potential prejudicial effects. Being satisfied that there is no basis for finding that the Director acted male fide in deciding to file a nolle, and in now presenting an ex officio indictment, the relevant question, it seems to me, now passes on and becomes one for the Court to determine by reference to, whether there would be an unfairness in the continuation of the proceedings such that Mr Burrell could not get a fair trial.” 
        
       
      
    15 It was submitted that his Honour applied a narrower test than he should have. The issue was not simply whether or not Mr Burrell could get a fair trial. The issue was whether or not the principle of fairness, beyond that of a fair trial, was such that the institution of the proceedings constituted an abuse. Courts may not be “converted into instruments of injustice and unfairness”. (Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 392-393. See also Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23 esp at 28-30.)  
     
      
    16 His Honour had, however, acknowledged in his earlier consideration of the relevant authorities, that the principle was not limited to the possibility of a fair trial. His Honour was not intending, in the passage emphasised, to do anything other than to highlight a significant aspect of the matters which fell for his consideration as indicated in the immediately succeeding paragraph.  
     
      
    17 His Honour went on immediately to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[219] Although the additional evidence which I have ruled admissible in relation to the Whelan indictment falls within a narrow compass, it does provide some additional support for the prosecution. More importantly, when the case is viewed as a whole, and when attention is given to the various matters which are later examined in relation to the foredoomed failed argument, I find that the Crown case in relation to both indictments is one that, on a prima facie basis, is well capable of being accepted by a jury.” 
        
       
       
      These observations are not directed to fair trial considerations. 
      
    18 The fact that his Honour was not applying a narrow test is further confirmed in the succeeding paragraphs. In par [220] his Honour emphasised that he had expressed his opinion on a prima facie basis and went on to say at [221] that the issues involved were jury questions. He added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[221] …… moreover, there is a significant public interest which would require the trials, which involve allegations of the most serious criminal conduct, should not be lightly left unredressed unless there is a real and tangible unfairness or an abuse of the court’s process of the rare and special kind, of which the authorities speak: In particular, see  
        Barton v The Queen  
        for an affirmation of the public interest and of the exceptional jurisdiction involved. 
        
       
       
        
        [222] Accordingly, I am unpersuaded that unfairness or abuse has been shown, arising out of the nolle prosequi, or out of the presentation or re-presentation of the two indictments, sufficient to stay the indictment on this basis.” 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour’s reference to questions of “unfairness” and of “abuse” in pars [221] and [222] indicate that he was not only concerned with the question of “a fair trial”. His Honour was well apprised of the question of fairness and of alleged abuse raised by the Applicant before him. I can detect no relevant legal error. No basis for this Court to intervene with his Honour’s discretionary decision has been shown.  
     
      
    20 Nor, in my opinion, has the Applicant established any relevant abuse, or unfairness, of any kind. 
     
      
    21 As quoted above, his Honour made reference to the fact that he had affirmed the ruling of Sully J with respect to the discretionary rejection of evidence. He had, however, admitted one piece of evidence that was available at the time of the first trial but not pressed before Sully J. This was an annotation in the Applicant’s street directory of the address of the Park Royal Hotel, where Mrs Whelan was last seen. His Honour also admitted a statement by Mr Buckley which was not tendered before Sully J, to which I will refer below.  
     
      
    22 In par [219], quoted above, his Honour described the additional evidence as being “within a narrow compass”. That may be so but the fact that there is additional evidence affects the issue of fairness. His Honour concluded that the annotation in the street directory “does have potential probative value” ([50] and [55]). The evidence of Mr Buckley, his Honour said, “would have probative value of some significance going to motive” [138] and that “the evidence has significant probative value” ([141]).  
     
      
    23 His Honour summarised the nature of Mr Buckley’s evidence in par [126] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[126] The substance of the evidence which, the Crown submits, he would be able to give concerning Mr Burrell’s financial position, is to the following effect: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) he had first met Mr Burrell in late June 1995, while he was working for Ultra Tune, and while Mr Burrell was working with Peter Grace, whose firm acted as the advertising agent for Ultra Tune; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) following a falling out with Mr Grace in late 1995, he became the subject of some court proceedings in Melbourne, in which Mr Grace was to be a witness on the opposing side. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) in the course of these proceedings, in April 1997, Mr Burrell offered to provide him with an affidavit or statement that would assist his case, but made his signature of it, or his provision of evidence, conditional upon payment of a sum of money ($15,000) – an offer which Mr Buckley refused on legal advice; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) Mr Burrell asked him during 1997 to provide a letter advising, untruthfully, that he was on the payroll of Ultra Tune, and was receiving a salary of $80,000 per annum, which he could then use in order to obtain a bank loan – a request with which he did not comply; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) Mr Burrell aggressively pestered him for money during 1997, indicating that he was desperate, and observing, on one occasion, words to the effect ‘you’d better fucking get the money for me … make it fucking happen’. (Exhibit V).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    24 His Honour went on to note the evidence that Mr Buckley gave at the inquest with respect to the communications in early 1997 in which he described Mr Burrell’s position in the following way: “He was desperate”.  
     
      
    25 This evidence supported the Crown case that Mr Burrell’s motivation for kidnapping Mrs Whelan was for the purposes of a ransom occasioned by the desperate state of his financial situation at the time. The nature of the Crown circumstantial case in this regard was set out in a document presented to Wood CJ at CL and quoted in his judgment of which the first seven paragraphs were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Bruce Burrell knew Kerry Whelan and Bernie Whelan. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Burrell knew the Whelans were wealthy. 
        
       
       
        
        3. By early 1997, Burrell’s financial position had become particularly precarious. He was unemployed. After the divorce, in December 1996, from his wife, Dallas, who had been financially supporting him for some years, he had little cash, was selling assets and borrowing from his father to meet mortgage payments on the property at Bungonia, which he had acquired in a property settlement. 
        
       
       
        
        4. In January or February 1997, in financial desperation, Burrell attempted to obtain from an acquaintance, Peter Buckley, a false letter of employment for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining a further bank loan. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Burrell later aggressively demanded money from Buckley. 
        
       
       
        
        6. In January 1997, Burrell told a female friend, Cathie Tulloch, that he had been looking for a property to buy in Tasmania. He asked her whether she was interested in moving there with him. She declined. 
        
       
       
        
        7. In February 1997, Burrell made enquiries about buying a property in Tasmania to set up a winery at a minimum cost of about $600,000-$750,000.” 
        
       
      
    26 Sully J had rejected the tender of the evidence marked 6-7 with respect to the expression of interest about the acquisition of the property in Tasmania. In his judgment, Wood CJ at CL came to the same conclusion. As a result of this exclusion, the evidence of Mr Buckley was the only evidence of motive beyond that referred to in the point marked 3, i.e. Mr Burrell selling assets and borrowing from his father. It is not, however, pertinent, contrary to the Appellant’s submission, that there was other evidence of financial need. In any event, the prosecution is not, within reason, limited to relying on only some of the evidence available to it. 
     
      
    27 The evidence of Mr Buckley is reasonably contemporaneous with the alleged kidnapping and does add evidence of significance on the critical question of motive. His Honour described its probative value as “significant”. He also refused to exclude the evidence under either s135 or s137, for reasons which appear to me to be correct and, on any view, were open to his Honour. 
     
      
    28 It is in this context that the decision of the Crown to reinstitute the proceedings must be assessed. It is of considerable significance that the Director of Public Prosecutions was not aware of this evidence. The evidence was known to the police. Mr Buckley had made a statement to them. However, that evidence was acquired in connection with the investigation by the police into the disappearance of Mrs Davis. It did not come to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions until after the trial before Sully J had terminated. Apparently a claim of public interest in the interview had been made and granted, until such time as Mr Buckley gave evidence at the inquest. It was only at that time that the Director of Public Prosecutions considered the possible relevance of the evidence in support of other evidence relating to Mr Burrell’s financial difficulties in 1997.  
     
      
    29 In his submissions, Mr Walker SC indicated that it had been known to the Crown in a general sense. It may be that the Crown is indivisible, but any appraisal by the public of the fairness of conduct by the prosecution must accept that the Crown is constituted by a number of separate organisational units.  
     
      
    30 Where relevant evidence of significant force is not known to the Director of Public Prosecutions, although it is known to other agencies of the Crown, the question of abuse or unfairness is placed in a distinctively different light. As Wood CJ at CL concluded:  
     
      
       
        
        “[143] I am also satisfied that although the relevant material was known to the police by the time that the matter came before Mr Justice Sully, it had not been available to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Although neither ‘fresh, nor ‘new’, in any strict sense of those expressions, as used, for example, in  
        R v Bikic  
        [2002] NSWCCA 227 and 
         Gallagher v The Queen 
         (1985) 160 CLR 392, it was, in my view, properly capable of being taken into account when the decision was taken to re-present the Whelan indictment. To that I will return when I come to consider the abuse of process issue.” 
        
       
      
    31 Mr Buckley’s evidence is capable of falling within the exceptions in the letter and the Guideline, so that the assertion by the Applicant of inconsistency is not made out. 
     
      
    32 With respect to the published Guideline, it appears to me to be open for the Director of Public Prosecutions to take the view that the original nolle prosequi was “made on erroneous material”. That is to say, it was made on incomplete material and was, in that sense, erroneous. It is, in my opinion also open for the Director to regard the evidence as “significantly new evidence”, to use the terminology of the letter. As long as such a conclusion is open, it is not appropriate for the Courts to inquire into the actual decision-making process. 
     
      
    33 His Honour expressed the view that the new evidence was “in a narrow compass”. This was not necessarily an observation directed to dismissing the significance of the evidence. The statement of Mr Buckley was not wide ranging in its scope but it was capable of adding to the strength of the Crown case on the issue of motive. As noted, his Honour referred to the evidence as “significant” in its probative value and refused to exclude it on discretionary grounds.  
     
      
    34 Where, as here, there is pertinent new evidence, the principle of fairness invoked on the part of the Applicant is not such as to suggest that the prosecution decision to re-institute the proceedings constitutes any kind of abuse. 
     
      
    35 Where, as here, it is open for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide that the additional evidence, of which he only became aware after the issue of the nolle prosequi, was of such a character as to change the judgment which he had originally made, the Courts should not hold that the re-institution of a prosecution constitutes an abuse.  
     
      
       
      Adverse Publicity 
       
      
    36 His Honour’s judgment at [236]-[285] considered the relevant legal principles and set out the relevant facts including a succinct summary of the adverse publicity. I incorporate those paragraphs in these remarks. 
     
      
    37 It was open to his Honour to conclude that, subject to appropriate directions, the passage of time would sufficiently attenuate the impact of the considerable body of publicity on the fairness of the Applicant’s trial. This Court should not interfere with his Honour’s exercise of his discretion in this regard. 
     
      
    38 Furthermore, no error of any character has been identified in his Honour’s statement of principle or in the application of the principles to the facts he found. I would come to the same conclusion for precisely the same reasons as expressed by Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    39 The extent and intensity of the publicity to which the Applicant has been subject may require measures to ensure a fair trial additional to those to which Wood CJ at CL made reference. The accessibility of information on the internet has been enhanced by contemporary search engines to such a degree that special measures are now called for. In addition to strong warnings to the jury, it may be advisable for the Crown to conduct searches in advance of a trial and request Australian based websites to remove references to an accused for the period of a trial.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    40 In my opinion leave to appeal should be refused.  
     
      
    41 A non publication order should be made, albeit not one that encompasses the making and rejection of the application before this Court. The restriction should apply to the evidentiary matters referred to in the judgment. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal refused. 
       
       
       2. Order that there be no publication of the matters set out in pars [21]-[35] of this judgment until the conclusion of the last to occur of the prosecution of the Applicant on charges with respect to Mrs Davis and Mrs Whelan. 
       
       
       3. Direct that this judgment not be placed on the Supreme Court website until the time specified in Order 2.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: On 1 August 2003 the applicant was arraigned before the District Court on an indictment containing two counts. The first count alleged that he did on 4 March 2003 detain [the victim], without her consent, with the intention of obtaining an advantage, and at the time of the commission of the offence, actual bodily harm was occasioned to her. That is an offence contrary to s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The second count on the indictment was that he did, on the same date, possess a prohibited weapon, namely, a side handled baton. This offence is contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act, and carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 The applicant pleaded guilty to both charges. He had previously pleaded guilty before the Local Court and was committed for sentence, but there were defects in the committal document that had to be cured by the presentation of an indictment. On 13 August 2003 the applicant was sentenced by Freeman DCJ to a term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 year for the first count, and a fixed term of 18 months for the second count to be served concurrently with the sentence for the first count. The sentences dated from 4 March 2003 and the applicant is eligible for release to parole on 3 March 20114 The applicant relies upon the following three grounds: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ground 1: His Honour erred in calculating the discount to be given to the Applicant at 20% 
         
         
        Ground 2: His Honour erred in assessing the criminality of the Applicant at the middle range of seriousness of offences contemplated by section 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act 
         
         
        Ground 3: His Honour’s sentence of the Applicant, in respect of both sentences, was manifestly excessive 
        
       
       
      Facts 
      
    5 There was an agreed statement of facts tendered before the sentencing judge that can be summarised as follows. On the day of the offence, the applicant was driving home from voluntary work when he saw the victim hitchhiking on Scenic Highway, Kincumber. At some stage after he stopped and picked her up, the victim asked the applicant whether he wanted to purchase any drugs from her. She also offered to perform oral sex on him. After obtaining money from an ATM, the applicant drove to a location where he stopped the vehicle and consumed several beers and two small pieces of paper, which he believed to be LSD and that he had purchased from the victim for fifty dollars. The victim then proceeded to perform oral sex on the applicant, for which he paid a further fifty dollars. This was followed by consensual sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    6 The victim then asked the applicant for more money, at which point the applicant, in his words, “lost it … just had a brain explosion”. The response of the applicant was such that it caused the victim to alight from the vehicle and start to run away. The applicant chased her and grabbed her by the hair, but lost his grip. She fled and he pursued her. This time he succeeding in taking hold of her and dragged her back to the vehicle. There he tied her wrists together using plastic cable ties and rope. 
     
      
    7 The victim again attempted to escape, but the applicant re-captured her and then bound her ankles and wound rope tightly around her breast and neck. He then laid her on the rear seat of his vehicle and covered her with a tarpaulin. He threaten her that “if you speak I’ll fucken stab ya”. He then proceeded to drive the vehicle in a direction away from his home. 
     
      
    8 A short time later the vehicle came to a stop due to a mechanical fault and the applicant phoned for a towing company. He threatened the victim not to move and pointed a chainsaw file at her. He tied electrical tape around her head and through her mouth to prevent her from speaking. The tape was pulled so tightly that it cut into her mouth on either side. He also used rope to tie her head to the bottom of the rear seat to prevent her from lifting her head. When the tow truck arrived, the applicant turned up the volume of his car radio so that the victim’s screams would not be heard. 
     
      
    9 The applicant’s vehicle was then towed to a paddock on his property. The applicant went inside and consumed some more beer. He then removed the victim from the vehicle and placed her into a wheelbarrow, which he covered with a tarpaulin. He then wheeled her away from his house towards bushland. He removed her from the barrow and tied one end of a piece of rope around her neck and attached the other end to a log. He left the victim in this position and returned to his house, saying that he would return in 20 minutes. 
     
      
    10 The victim managed to secure her release by untying the rope binding her legs and that around her neck attached to the log. She began to run away, but the applicant was at that time returning from the house and caught her, dragging her back through the bushes. He retied her to a tree before again leaving her. 
     
      
    11 The victim made a further, this time successful, attempt to escape. She made her way through bushland to a road where she was able to flag down passing motorists. She still had ties around her wrists and tape around her neck and face. These were removed by members of the public while they waited for police. 
     
      
    12 The victim suffered severe swelling to her hands. She had cuts and abrasions over most of her body, particularly to her arms and legs. 
     
      
    13 Police searched the applicant’s home on 4 March 2003 and they located a side handled baton. The applicant was contacted by telephone and asked to attend the police station, which he did. After being interviewed he was arrested and charged with a number of offences. 
     
      
    14 During the course of the interview the applicant admitted to police that he had tied up the victim after she asked for more money, but he said he had no idea why he did this. He told police that, while he was trying to tie her up, the victim was yelling, crying and screaming. When the applicant arrived at the property, his vehicle being towed there, his partner was at the house and he had spoken to her on the phone when the vehicle broke down. He removed the victim into the bush so that she could not be heard yelling and screaming at the house. He told police that he did not know what he intended to do with the victim but he tied her up so that she could not go anywhere. The applicant admitted to police that at one stage he tried to force his underpants and socks into the victim’s mouth. He also admitted that the victim asked him whether she was going to die and he said, “No”. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing proceedings 
      
    15 The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge. He stated that he had not planned to do anything with the victim. He said that, after she had performed fellatio on him, they had sexual intercourse, and it was then that she asked him for more money. He became angry and confused. He said that while she was tied up to the tree on his property, he obtained a can of insect repellent, so that she would not be bitten by mosquitoes. 
     
      
    16 The applicant was aged 32 at the date of sentence. He had been in a long-term relationship with a woman and they lived in a farmhouse on a property owned by his father. He had one child aged 7 years to his partner and she had a child from another relationship aged 16 years and who lived with them. That relationship had ceased by the time of sentencing, with his partner expressing the view that they would not be reconciled. 
     
      
    17 The applicant’s background was unremarkable and he has caring and supportive parents. He has been mostly in steady employment and is regarded as a reliable employee. He has a minor criminal record of little relevance other than that in November 2001 he was fined for a number of offences relating to his unauthorised possession of an unregistered firearm. The applicant admitted in evidence that he had “a problem” with alcohol, drugs and pornography. 
     
      
    18 There was in evidence a pre-sentence report, but some of the observations and opinions of the officer were disputed. His Honour rejected one sentence on the basis that the officer did not have the expertise to make the finding contained in it. The officer was required to give evidence and was cross-examined at length as to certain factual matters and findings that he had set out in his report. In particular, the officer’s view as to the lack of contrition shown by the applicant was hotly contested. 
     
      
    19 In that regard the applicant gave evidence, through leading questions, that it was difficult for him “to tell people how you feel inside” and that it had always been that way. He was asked about trouble that he had sleeping after the offence because he was “going over the incident and wondering how the girl felt”. He had formed the view that “during the incident she would have been terrified and she would have been, her and her family would have been traumatised afterwards”. When he considered these things, he felt “pretty bad”. 
     
      
    20 The applicant’s former partner gave evidence, through leading questions, that the applicant had an inability “to effectively communicate what he’s feeling inside”. She believed that he had “feelings of intense grief…..but he keeps it to himself”. She said that he had never physically abused her or the children, and that generally he would walk away from arguments.21 There was also in evidence a psychiatric report prepared for the sentencing proceedings. There is little in that report of relevance. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he did not experience sexual arousal during the offence nor were his actions consistent with any sexual fantasy experienced by him. His parents told the psychiatrist that they believed the offence was out of character. The psychiatrist opined that the applicant had a history of alcohol abuse but no other pre-existing psychiatric condition. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 Discount for plea and contrition 
      
    22 The first ground complains of the discount awarded for the plea of guilty. His Honour said during the course of his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Clearly the prisoner is entitled to the benefit of a discount because of the early stage at which his pleas were entered. Not only do his pleas have the standard utilitarian value, I think it must have been seen as having the very distinct advantage of avoiding putting his victim through the trauma of the trial. I have no doubt that a trial would have been especially traumatic and unpleasant for the victim. 
         
        
       
      However, his Honour went on to note that he had seen “little in the way of appropriate contrition or remorse”. His Honour referred to answers in the record of interview and statements in the psychiatric report, but concluded that “there was no volunteering, nor indeed any eliciting of any regret or concern for the girl”. 
       
      
    23 In respect of the probation officer’s opinion, his Honour stated 
     
      
       
        
         
        The presentence report specifically makes the point that there is little in the way of concern for the girl. Consequently there were a number of attempts made in the cross-examination of [the officer] to point him as being biased, having lost objectivity and so on. In my view those attempts were not successful. 
        
       
       
      His Honour referred to the evidence given by the applicant and noted that the contrition “came very late, was in [a] mannered way of delivery and did not, to me, sound like [a] convincing expression of genuine remorse and contrition”. 
      
    24 His Honour then stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Nonetheless it has been said (sic), and taking into account the additional value to the utilitarian (sic), I have determined that a twenty per cent discount from the sentence I originally regard as appropriate should be applied.  
        
       
      
    25 Leaving aside the question of the appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, I do not believe that any error is shown in his Honour’s assessment of the contrition, if any, shown by the applicant. This is a question of fact, and this Court would only interfere if his Honour’s finding was not open on the evidence or was inconsistent with the evidence. I am far from satisfied that this is the case. The suggestion made in written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant that his Honour should have found contrition in the fact that the applicant did not seek bail pending the outcome of the sentencing is untenable. 
     
      
    26 Significance is also placed upon the asserted fact that the admissions to the police had assisted the Crown case and, without them, the prosecution would have been met with difficulty “not the least of which would have been the credibility of the victim herself”. In light of the state in which the victim was found and the objects located at the scene and in the applicant’s motor vehicle, in my view the Crown case would have been overwhelming. 
     
      
    27 In any event, a finding of contrition may lead to a discount in the sentence but it does not have to do so in any specific amount, either in connection with a plea or as a discrete matter. Contrition is so bound up with other factors involved in the synthesis that resolves into an appropriate sentence that I have difficulty seeing how it could ever be the subject of a particular discount without double counting. For example, contrition is so fundamental to an assessment of the rehabilitative prospects of the offender and a determination of the likelihood of further offending that I do not understand how those matters could be taken into account without also taking into account that the offender was contrite. So much was recognised in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [116]. 
     
      
    28 There is perhaps more merit in the complaint that his Honour allowed only a discount of 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea in a case where the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court, and made admissions to police. In R v Hanslow [2004] NSWCCA 163 at [27], also an application for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed by Judge Freeman, I commented on the fact that his Honour had granted a discount of only 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea in a case which clearly called for the maximum discount available and expressed concern that his Honour was not exercising the discretion appropriately. But in the present case his Honour was, with respect, entitled to determine that the appropriate discount was 20 per cent, otherwise the guideline in Thomson and Houlton is converted into a rule; see R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 113. 
     
      
    29 I am unpersuaded that the ground has been made out. Certainly the applicant’ contention that there should have been a quantifiable discount for plea and contrition of 30 per cent is without foundation. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 The seriousness of the offence 
      
    30 The next ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in determining that the offence fell towards the middle range of seriousness for an offence of this nature and thus a starting point of 10 years before applying the discount for the plea was too high. The applicant’s solicitor urged on this Court, as he did to his Honour, that the offence was at the lower range of the scale of seriousness. Once more the determination of the seriousness of an offence is, generally, a matter of fact finding and within the discretionary judgment of the sentencing judge. But I would make the same assessment that his Honour made: it was an offence of at least middle range seriousness. It was a matter for his Honour how that finding translated into a particular starting sentence. 
     
      
    31 The applicant’s solicitor sought to argue from the terms of the section and the second reading speech that in some way the finding of the judge was inconsistent with the intention of Parliament in re-drafting the provisions relating to kidnapping with the repeal of s 90A. The argument is, as I understand it, that because the advantage sought to be obtained was not ransom, the offence must be considered to be less serious than if it were and, therefore, could not merit a sentence within the middle range for an offence of its kind. That argument is, in my opinion, completely without merit. I do not believe that there is any purpose to be served in considering the second reading speech when assessing the seriousness of a particular instance of an offence against the maximum penalty prescribed. 
     
      
    32 The gravamen of the offence for the purpose of sentencing is the unlawful detaining of a person. As his Honour noted, there are a number of factors that can be relevant in making an assessment of the seriousness of an offence under s 86 including the period of the detention, the circumstances of the detention, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention. The last factor, the nature of the advantage that the offender sought to obtain, is not, in my view, conclusive as to the seriousness of the offence. In particular, simply because the section makes reference to one specific type of advantage, that is ransom, it does not follow that the presence or absence of that particular type of advantage is decisive in a determination of the seriousness of the particular offence before the court. In any event, I am not persuaded that, before an offence can come within the most serious category of an offence falling within the scope of the section, the detention must be for the purpose of ransom. 
     
      
    33 In the present case the offender was unwilling or unable to express the intention with which he acted or the advantage he sought to achieve by detaining the victim. Of course he pleaded guilty and, thereby, accepted that he did act with the intention of obtaining an advantage. It is clear beyond doubt that he detained the victim intending to obtain an advantage for himself whatever that advantage might have been. Even if, at the time of her escape, the offender had not determined what benefit or advantage he was ultimately to obtain from the victim’s captivity, that fact does not seem to me to be a matter of mitigation or to detract from the seriousness of his course of conduct toward the victim. 
     
      
    34 During the course of his remarks, after noting that he must avoid double counting for the injuries suffered by the victim, Judge Freeman stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The girl was badly scratched, suffered the abrasion which I have recounted but apparently suffered no broken bones or other more significantly threatening injury. She was kept bound, with ties and tape cutting into her mouth……She was dragged to and frow. She was covered, threatened and later carried by barrow into the bush. Her expectations must have been that worse was to follow with the possibility if not the probability of a fatal outcome. Her ordeal went on for four hours. I do not think this is an example which can be said to fall towards the lower end of the range of offences of this nature. 
        
       
      
    35 The submission was made in written submissions but not pursued at the hearing that, in the absence of specific evidence, the court could not take into account the effect of the detention on the victim and what “expectation” she may have formed about what the offender intended to do to her or the purpose of her detention. It was argued that the court should be cautious when drawing a conclusion about the effect of the detention on this particular victim because she was a hitchhiker who offered to sell the applicant sex and drugs. I frankly do not understand that submission. It is not surprising that it was abandoned. It would offend commonsense to suggest that a victim, who was bound, gagged, threatened with being stabbed and finally tied to a tree in bushland by a stranger who pursued her every time she sought to escape, would not be in terror of her kidnapper and what he might do to her. It is not fanciful to find that the victim would in such a situation contemplate the worst, whatever criticism might be made of her character or reputation. 
     
      
    36 The applicant seeks to rely upon the fact that, although the victim was only 15 years old, he though she was 18 or 19. I do not believe the fact that the applicant believed that the victim was older than she was is of any significance in evaluating his culpability for his conduct toward her.37 While it may be accepted that the victim did not receive any serious injury, it does not follow that the offence was not one falling within at least the middle range of seriousness having regard to all the objective circumstances of the offence. Had the injuries been more serious, the sentence would have approached nearer the maximum sentence for the offence. The offence carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years and the whole of the applicant’s conduct and the consequences for the victim had to be considered when determining how serious the offence was as against the maximum sentence prescribed. 
     
      
    38 This ground is not made out. It was well within his Honour’s discretion to consider that the offence was one warranting a starting sentence of 10 years before discounting the sentence by reason of the plea of guilty. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 A manifestly excessive sentence 
      
    39 It was submitted that his Honour made a number of errors that, in combination, caused his discretion to miscarry such that this court should intervene. 
     
      
    40 The first contention is that his Honour failed to place sufficient weight on the fact that the applicant ingested a prohibited drug sold to him by the victim. I do not understand it to be a mitigating fact that a person commits an offence as a result of the effects of a prohibited drug taken voluntarily by the person. In some cases, where, for example, the person knows the effect that the drug or alcohol is likely to have upon his behaviour, it may be an aggravating feature of the offence. It may be a matter of mitigation that the person commits an offence that is out of character by reason of the effect of intoxication, but this is not generally so where the substance taken is known by the offender to be a prohibited drug: R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 306 at 327. The obvious difference to the approach between the effects of alcohol and a prohibited drug is that the ingestion of the latter is itself illegal because of the deleterious effect of it on a person’s mental state and behaviour. 
     
      
    41 The applicant’s solicitor seems to find some significance in the fact that the victim sold the applicant the drug that may have affected him. I am quite unable to see the relevance of that fact at all. The applicant voluntarily decided to buy the drug and obtained money for that purpose and to pay for the victim’s sexual favours. He no doubt took the drug for the effect it would have on him and he took the risk of the consequences of his actions as a result. If that consequence was that he acted in any abnormally aggressive manner and over-reacted to the victim’s request for more money, so be it. In my view the resultant conduct was so serious that there was no mitigation in the fact that it might have been caused by the effect of what he believed to be an illegal drug upon him. Also the fact that serious criminal conduct may have elements of the bizarre or extraordinary about it does not make it any less liable to be punished for what it is. 
     
      
    42 In any event, his Honour treated the taking of the drug as being neutral as he was not satisfied that it had any effect upon the applicant or at least that it gave rise to his criminal conduct. That was the most favourable finding that the applicant could receive. 
     
      
    43 The Court has been referred to statistical information, notwithstanding that the applicant’s solicitor appreciates its limited value. Statistical information may have value in an appropriate case to indicate a range of sentences for offences where there is a predictable similarity in the conduct amounting to the offence. I doubt that offences under s 86 will be sufficiently homogenous that a reference to statistics alone will be of much assistance. But even if a range could be established, it does not follow that a sentence for a particular offence or offender has to fall within that range. It is merely a sounding board upon which a particular sentence may be judged. In this case there is nothing in the material that makes this particular sentence ring untrue. 
     
      
    44 The applicant has relied upon a decision of this Court in R v Anforth [2003] NSWCCA 222. That was a Crown appeal following the imposition of a suspended sentence. The Court allowed the Crown appeal and substituted a full-time custodial sentence. I see nothing in that decision that suggests that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was excessive: there is simply no point in a comparison of the facts and circumstances of the offences and offenders between the two cases. 
     
      
    45 Finally, it is submitted that the sentence for the offence relating to the baton was excessive in the absence of any evidence that it was to be used for an unlawful purpose. Three observations can be made about that submission. An offence relating to prohibited weapons and firearms is itself serious notwithstanding that the weapon may not have been possessed with the intention of carrying out a crime. What this Court has said with regards to the policy relating to firearms offences applies equally to offences involving prohibited weapons capable of causing serious injury. See R v Cromarty [2004] NSWCCA 54 and R v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA 165. The applicant had previously been convicted for offences involving firearms. The sentence for that offence was made concurrent to the sentence on the first count even though it was an unrelated offence and arguably should have been met with a sentence that was at least partly cumulative to the sentence for the first count. 
     
      
    46 There was in my view no error in the exercise of Judge Freeman’s discretion warranting the intervention of this Court and the sentences were not manifestly excessive. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     REGINA v Christopher HOERLER 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal against sentence. The Respondent pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Miles AJ sentenced him to a period of imprisonment of eleven years and fixed a non-parole period of eight years and three months. Originally the Respondent was arraigned on a charge of murder. The trial proceeded until the point at which the prosecution closed its case. Counsel for the accused sought time to get instructions. Thereafter the Crown accepted a plea of guilty in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
       
      The Offence 
       
      
    2 The victim was a seven month old baby, Jordan Anderson. The offence occurred at Wagga Wagga on the early morning of 25 February 2000. The baby’s mother was Ms Louise Anderson who lived at the house with her three children, Jordan and two other sons then aged about three and four. The offender had been in a relationship with Ms Anderson for some two months and was also living at the house.  
     
      
    3 During the course of the evening of 24 February 2000 a party took place at the house. People came and went. Some cannabis and beer were consumed. The music was loud. By about 1.30am the music was turned off and at that time all except one young man had left. The Respondent walked that man to his home nearby. Meanwhile Ms Anderson had gone to bed. Her two elder boys were asleep in the lounge room on the sofa. Jordan was asleep in his pram or stroller in the lounge room when the last guest left.  
     
      
    4 The offender returned between 1.30 and 2.00am. His Honour found that he had drunk about nine bottles of beer and was probably moderately affected by beer and cannabis, possibly affected to a significant degree. 
     
      
    5 During the course of the evening nothing untoward was noted about Jordan’s behaviour. He was sometimes asleep and sometimes awake, either in the lounge room or in the backyard in his pram or stroller. According to Ms Anderson, Jordan was in the lounge room in his pram strapped in when she went to sleep. 
     
      
    6 Ms Anderson’s next recollection is of the offender waking her and saying that Jordan had fallen out of his pram and was not breathing. At about 3.00am neighbours heard the offender calling for help in a distressed voice saying something to the effect that “the baby is not breathing”. An ambulance was dispatched at 3.11am. The ambulance officer sought unsuccessfully to resuscitate Jordan. 
     
      
    7 The police arrived at about 3.30am. The offender told them he had been lying on the floor and when he woke up saw Jordan on the floor frothing at the mouth. He said that he did not see Jordan fall out of the pram. In later interviews the offender maintained this account. 
     
      
    8 A post-mortem examination was conducted and found the following injuries: 
     
      
       
      1 widespread abrasions and bruises to the head and face; 
       
       
      2 petechial haemorrhages of the face; 
       
       
      3 torn frenulum of the lip; 
       
       
      4 penetrating injuries to the hard palate by the lower teeth; 
       
       
      5 lacerated liver; 
       
       
      6 bruised pancreas and small bowel; 
       
       
      7 blood in the peritoneum; 
       
       
      8 crush injuries to the toes; 
       
       
      9 multiple rib fractures; 
       
       
      10 inhalation of vomitus. 
       
      
    9 The report of the forensic pathologist also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “With the exception of the bruised scrotum, all injuries appeared to be of the same age, and were fresh. They were all of similar origin, in that they were the result of blunt force injury. The rounded bruises of the trunk were of the type seen by contact with knuckles or fingertips. This was consistent with the underlying injuries 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Most injuries were not specific enough to implicate any single object.” 
        
       
      
    10 That was not true however of the crush injuries to the toes. Those injuries were described by the forensic pathologist as having “been caused by a heavy crushing force acting from front to back. The pattern of parallel bruises and extent of injury would be consistent with infliction by the clamp …”. 
     
      
    11 His Honour made the following findings with respect to toe injuries: 
     
      
       
        
        “[27] … At post-mortem examination, Dr Lee found marks on the toes of both feet in the nature of bruising caused by crushing injury. The marks were in a pattern of parallel bruises or lines, suggesting the application of force more than once. When informed of the finding by Dr Lee, police that evening carried out a further search of the house and on a box inside the wardrobe of the main bedroom, they found what was described as a clamp. Its purpose, as Ms Anderson explained, was to attach a small electric fan to a table or other items of furniture. Dr Lee thought that the injuries to the toes were consistent with the application of the clamp.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour also referred to the evidence of a forensic biologist with respect to bloodstains on the shorts worn by the Respondent during the evening. The doctor referred to expert evidence on blood spatter patterns to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “[17] … there was medium velocity impact spatter on the top of the mattress cover and also on the bedroom wall. He also concluded that there was medium velocity impact spatter on the shorts worn by the offender which was consistent with the projection of blood from the deceased, assuming that the deceased was on the bed at the time and had received injury sufficient to produce external bleeding such as the injuries to the mouth and lip.” 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour summarised expert evidence to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “[18] … the only injuries which could reasonably be expected to produce external bleeding were those of the palate and lip and that ‘ 
        the external appearances of bleeding from those sites would be expected to be modified’  
        by active or forced movement of the head, such as coughing, shaking or impact to the head.” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour also referred to the evidence of a paediatric surgeon, which he accepted, to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “[20] …He concluded that death followed promptly after the inhalation of vomit. He considered that the injuries generally would have required considerable force, that the facial injuries were consistent with the body being dragged facedown over a surface such as a carpet or sofa, that the palate injury was caused by a blow to the jaw and the abdominal injury by a non-penetrating blow or blows of considerable force and not by falling out of a pram. Dr Currie considered that the cause of death was inhalation of vomit and asphyxiation and concluded:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘What caused Jordan to vomit and aspirate is indeterminate, as the shock of the head injury with some concussion or the squeezing chest injury with fractured ribs or the blow to the liver could all have produced a large vomit with aspiration.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    15 The Respondent did not give evidence in the sentence hearing. However, he had made statements to a psychiatrist and the probation and parole officer that he had only struck the child twice at the request of the mother to stop it crying. His Honour rejected that evidence. His Honour concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[26] I conclude, and am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the extent of the child’s injuries was much greater than what could have been caused by striking the head twice with an open hand. The injury which pushed the lower teeth into the roof of the mouth must have involved considerable force delivered by a punch. Similarly, the injury or injuries to the abdominal area must have involved considerable force also delivered by at least one punch. There is a possibility that the rib fractures were caused by squeezing or hugging of the baby but it is unlikely. The injury to the frenulum was caused either by the severe blow which caused the injury to the palate or by a separate blow of less severity. Overall there must have been several and not only two blows. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [29] The only rational explanation of the circumstances is that it was the offender who alone took the child from the pram in the lounge room into the bedroom and there struck the child repeatedly with at least one punch to the head and at least one punch to the abdomen and at some stage applied the clamp to the baby’s toes causing the child to vomit and die of asphyxiation or vomit inhalation or both. The child died as a result of an unlawful and dangerous act on the part of the offender.” 
        
       
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    16 His Honour noted that the varying degrees of criminality inherent in the offence of manslaughter meant that the range of sentences and penalties imposed is wider than for other offences. His Honour noted the proposition that “little assistance can be gained from other cases” but stated that he accepted the submission put on behalf of the Respondent that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[35] … The similarity between the factual circumstances of cases involving the unlawful killing of very young children by parents or carers may enable useful comparisons to be drawn, particularly where there has been pronouncement at appellate level in order to avoid disparity or inconsistency in sentence, both with regard to the objective seriousness of the particular facts under consideration and the weight to be given to various aspects of the subjective circumstances of the particular offender.” 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour referred to the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416 and particularly to his Honour’s observations at pars [27]-[30] of that judgment which Miles AJ incorporated in his own judgment. 
     
      
    18 Those observations by Wood CJ at CL are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[27] The offence of manslaughter is one for which the maximum available sentence is one of imprisonment for 25 years. The offence involves the felonious taking of human life, and for that reason it has been recognised as a most serious crime:  
        Hill  
        (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. The value, which the community places upon the preservation of human life, is reflected by the need to have conduct involved in its taking denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of the case:  
        McDonald  
        NSWCCA 12 December 1995. It is, however, an offence which involves an excessively wide variety of circumstances, calling for a range of penal and sometimes non-penal outcomes, with the consequence that it is difficult to obtain much by way of assistance from reference to the Judicial Commission statistics or from other cases:  
        Elliott  
        NSWCCA 14 February 1991 per Newman J, and  
        Green  
        (1999) NSWCCA 97.  
        
       
       
        
        [28] Notwithstanding the caution which needs to be exercised in seeking guidance from other cases of manslaughter, reference to decisions similarly involving the killing by a parent or a carer of a young child, by an unlawful and dangerous act, is of some assistance. In this respect, I have had regard to the following cases:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a)  
          Vaughan  
          (1991) 56 A Crim R 355, where the Court of Criminal Appeal, following a successful Crown appeal, increased a sentence imposed on a twenty-two year old man who had killed his five month old daughter by flinging her several times onto a couch, to one involving a minimum term of three and a half years, with an additional term of 18 months, observing that the substituted sentence was a ""light one"".  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          b)  
          Ditfort  
          NSWCCA 17 March 1992, where a minimum term of seven and a half years, with an additional term of two and a half years, was affirmed on appeal, although said to be at the top of the appropriate range, in the case of a twenty-nine year old prisoner who had killed the two and a half year old daughter of his de facto wife by punching her in the stomach and in the head. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          c)  
          Dawney  
          1999 NSWSC, Barr J, 15 September 1999, where a sentence of eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years was imposed in respect of a mother who had smothered her three year old child, being an offender who was suffering from depression, anger and a personality disorder, and who had experienced a violent and unhappy childhood as well as abuse while an adult. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          d)  
          Howard  
          (2000) NSWSC 876, Studdert J, where a sentence of seven years and six months, with a five year six months non-parole period, was imposed in respect of a twenty-six year old offender, who had killed the eight month old son of his de facto partner, by shaking him because he would not stop crying, and who had a history of an unstable family background and a lack of social or anger management skills. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          e)  
          Bilton  
          (2000) NSWSC 1113, Bell J, where a sentence of seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four and a half years was imposed in respect of an offender who had killed a two year old child by punching him in the chest and shaking him vigorously and who was assessed as having a very low intelligence and as having shown great remorse. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          f)  
          Recalde  
          (2000) NSWSC 1247, James J, where a sentence of nine years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of six years, was imposed in respect of a male aged twenty-three who had killed the six month old son of his de facto partner by throwing him, with considerable force, onto a kitchen bench after scalding himself with boiling water.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [29] In each of Vaughan, Ditfort, Dawney, Howard and Recalde there had been a plea of guilty and in Howard, Recalde and Bilton the court took into account the circumstance that the prisoner would serve the sentence under strict protection.  
        
       
       
        
        [30] Of immediate relevance are the unequivocal statements in those decisions, particularly by Lee CJ at CL in  
        Vaughan  
        ; of Hunt CJ at CL in  
        Ditfort  
        ; and of Studdert J in  
        Howard  
        concerning the special need for deterrent sentences in this type of case arising from the vulnerability of helpless infants and the dependency which they have upon their carers for their safety and well-being. While frustration and anger can easily arise in a parent or carer, in response to the crying or misconduct which is an entirely normal incident in the rearing of a child, that can never justify a reaction that involves any form of violent physical assault. In the prisoner's favour, in the assessment of his objective criminality, is his immaturity, his lack of experience and training in parenting, and the stressful situation in which he and Sarah found themselves. In combination, the potential for violence and inappropriate treatment of the child was very high. To a degree, this explains his criminality, although it does not excuse it, nor, as I will later explain, does it entitle the prisoner to attribute responsibility to persons or organisations other than himself.” 
        
       
      
    19 Miles AJ went on to state, with reference to the cases summarised by Wood CJ at CL in Woodland, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[37] These cases establish a range of sentences for the unlawful killing of very young children by parents or carers between five years imprisonment on a plea of not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter ( 
        Vaughan  
        (1991) 56 A Crim R 355) and ten years imprisonment ( 
        Ditfort 
        , 
          
        NSWCCA, 17 March 1992, also a case of plea of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter). Lee CJ at CL said in  
        Vaughan 
        , 
          
        at p359, that, at that stage, the cases did no more than demonstrate that the courts have always regarded assaults by parents on little children resulting in death, as grave and serious cases of manslaughter.” 
        
       
      
    20 His Honour then referred to sentences for murder and, also, to what his Honour identified to be a sentencing pattern in the aforementioned cases. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[40] I understand that sentences of less than 25 years have been imposed for murder in recent years. Unless and until there is a single offence of homicide in which murder and manslaughter are undifferentiated, I think that it would be entirely against the tradition and history of the criminal law to allow a situation to develop where the crime of murder could be treated as less serious than manslaughter except in the clearest and most exceptional circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        [41] Further, to impose the maximum penalty for the present offence, or indeed, to impose a sentence of substantially more than ten years, is so far beyond the range of sentences established by past sentencing practice in this Court in recent years that to do so is not the task of a judge at first instance but of the Court of Criminal Appeal if it is minded to do so, and then, as I understand it, only after an indication that the past practice is to be changed.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour referred to the plea of guilty both in terms of its utilitarian value and as an indication of contrition. His Honour noted that the plea was offered at the end of the Crown case. The discussions between the Crown and the representatives of the Respondent were not such as to enable his Honour to conclude that the plea was proffered at the first available opportunity. In the end his Honour assessed the utilitarian value at ten percent on the basis that it was of limited value. This allowance also took into account the element of contrition which his Honour also described as being of limited significance for the reasons he advanced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        [47] “Moreover, despite what we now known to be the brazen denials to the police and the attempt to implicate innocent people, there is some evidence of contrition in what the offender said to the psychiatrist and the probation and parole officer. The human mind is complex and conflicting attitudes and emotions compete with each other. I accept that there is an element of positive contrition.” 
        
       
      
    22 Perhaps the central step in his Honour’s reasoning, after setting out the variety of considerations to which he would have regard on the issue of penalty, found in the following paragraphs of his Honour’s judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “[49] The sentencing judge in  
        Ditfort  
        (described by the Court of Criminal Appeal as the most experienced judge in the State) took into account a relatively late plea of guilty of manslaughter offered on arraignment for murder. Although that was in the days before the guideline judgments, it may be inferred that, if there had not been a plea of guilty and there had been a verdict of manslaughter after trial, a sentence of some twelve years would have been imposed and not interfered with by the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case. The facts, and the culpability, involved were much the same as in the present case. The sentencing judge referred to the community’s demand that a heavy sentence be imposed for such an horrific crime against a defenceless child in the applicant’s case. Hunt CJ at CL added that there is always a paramount need for sentences in such cases to provide public deterrence against crimes of violence against children. For my self, I am not confident about the deterrent effect on such socially aberrant behaviour and consider that it should be acknowledged that the main purpose of severe punishment in such cases is denunciation, even retribution. It makes no difference to the result. 
        
       
       
        
        [50] I propose then to take twelve years as a starting point for the purposes of the present case. I would proceed to reduce it by some 10 per cent for the limited utilitarian value of the plea and the limited significance of the actual contrition. However, there is the countervailing factor of the matters to be taken into account on Form 1. For the reasons given in the guideline judgment and as a matter of discretion where a young offender is facing a lengthy sentence for the offence on the indictment, I would increase the overall sentences only marginally for the matters on Form 1.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour went on to fix the non-parole period, noting the reports from the probation and parole service and of psychiatrists. His Honour did not make a finding of special circumstances and accordingly fixed the statutory relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      Issues on the Appeal 
       
      
    24 The Crown identified two legal errors in his Honour’s reasoning which, it submitted, would justify this Court intervening. 
     
      
    25 First, the Crown directed attention to that passage of his Honour’s judgment at par [40], quoted in par [20] above, in which he indicated that it was unacceptable for the crime of murder to be “treated as less serious than manslaughter except in the clearest and most exceptional circumstances”. The Crown submitted that, although there was a clear hierarchy in offences of homicide, it was not the case that sentences for manslaughter would overlap sentences for murder only in “the clearest and most exceptional circumstances”. This proposition is correct. The degree of overlap between sentencing for manslaughter and murder is not able to be stated in terms of identifying “most exceptional circumstances” or words to that effect. 
     
      
    26 The elements of murder include an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. Such an intention is, of course, of the greatest significance in the sentencing exercise. Where it is present and a charge of murder is made out, the appropriate sentence will generally be higher than for other forms of homicide. Plainly, other circumstances being equal, the moral culpability of the offender is significantly higher where one person causes the death of another in circumstances where an intention to do so exists. Nevertheless, the multifarious situations in which homicide can occur and the wide range of other considerations that must be taken into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion are such that it is not correct to conclude that it is only in the “clearest and most exceptional circumstances” that any conviction for manslaughter could lead to a higher sentence than any conviction for murder. 
     
      
    27 Many charges of manslaughter are accompanied by the requisite intent, but the conviction is reduced to manslaughter by reason of provocation or diminished responsibility. In some such cases the extent of provocation or the degree to which responsibility was diminished is not such as to significantly reduce the appropriate penalty below the maximum permissible for manslaughter. On the other hand there are situations in which the charge of murder may be accompanied by circumstances which reduce the objective gravity of the offence, e.g. a case of euthanasia or a suicide pact. Such matters can result in an appropriate sentence being well below the maximum permissible for manslaughter. 
     
      
    28 There is a hierarchy of offences. However the existence of such a hierarchy does not lead to the situation that, where sentences of less than twenty-five years have been imposed for murder, sentences for manslaughter must generally be imposed for a significantly lesser period. 
     
      
    29 Even a case where there is present an intention to kill or maim, which would constitute murder but which is reduced, by reason of provocation or diminished responsibility, to a charge of manslaughter, will not necessarily attract a higher sentence than other forms of manslaughter, including the one relevant here, i.e. killing by an unlawful and dangerous act. As a five judge bench of this Court, including Gleeson CJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL, Simpson and Hidden JJ, said in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381: 
     
      
       
        
        “The argument for the appellant advanced on this appeal appeared to assume that a case of provocation manslaughter is necessarily, or at least ordinarily, worse than a case of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. We do not accept that. Each case depends upon its own circumstances. The range of sentencing available in the case of manslaughter is notoriously wide. There have been cases where provocation manslaughter has resulted in non-custodial sentences.” 
        
       
      
    30 Paragraph [40] of his Honour’s judgment, set out in par [20] above, is open to the interpretation for which the Crown contends, but does not require such an interpretation. I have no doubt that a judge of the experience of Miles AJ was well aware that sentences for murder and manslaughter can and do overlap. His Honour was referring to the general position that a conviction for murder would ordinarily attract a greater penalty than a conviction for manslaughter. I would reject this basis for alleged legal error. 
     
      
    31 The second error identified by the Crown concerned his Honour’s treatment of the sentences imposed in other cases, as summarised in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Woodland and, particularly, the sentence in R v Ditfort NSWCCA 17 March 1992 (unreported).  
     
      
    32 Although his Honour recognised the wide variety of circumstances in which the crime of manslaughter can occur he did place reliance on what he identified to be an established range in child killing cases. Referring to the cases summarised in Woodland, supra, his Honour accepted at par [37] quoted in par [19] above that: “These cases establish a range of sentences for the unlawful killing of very young children by parents or carers between 5 years imprisonment and … 10 years imprisonment”. (See also at [41] quoted in par [4] supra.) Miles AJ adopted a similar analysis in another case of this character which his Honour sentenced on the same day as the present case. (See R v Wilson [2003] NSWSC 1257 at [62]-[68].) 
     
      
    33 His Honour proceeded to treat Ditfort as if it were a benchmark. Indeed at par [49], set out at par [22] above, his Honour found that “the facts and the culpability involved were much the same as in the present case”. His Honour took what he understood to be the starting point in Ditfort as the starting point for the sentencing exercise before him. 
     
      
    34 Counsel for the Respondent relied on Ditfort and in particular the references in Ditfort to the sentence in that case being at “the top of the range”. However, that is to misunderstand the references in that case to “a range”. Those references concerned the appropriate range for sentencing in that specific case, including both its objective and subjective circumstances. They were not references to an appropriate “range” for child killing on a charge of manslaughter.  
     
      
    35 Prior cases and Judicial Commission statistics do not often determine a range appropriate for a particular offence. They reflect what was regarded as appropriate in the wide variety of circumstances of those particular prior cases. Whether or not a sentencing pattern can be said to have emerged requires consideration of the whole body of sentences. It is unlikely that any such pattern can be said to have been established unless there have been a significant number of cases covering a wide variety of objective circumstances. Unless that is so, the cases would not encompass the relevant range of objective criminality. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion this second basis on which the Crown alleges his Honour committed a legal error should be upheld. I do not agree that the cases to which his Honour referred were such as to lead to the conclusion that a recognisable sentencing pattern or range can be said to have emerged with respect to the crime of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act committed by parents or carers on very young children. Nor, in my opinion, is Ditfort so closely analogous as to serve as a benchmark for purposes of the sentencing exercise in this case. 
     
      
    37 Wood CJ at CL did not suggest in Woodland that the six cases which he set out in his judgment indicated anything in the nature of a sentencing pattern. What his Honour said when introducing the list of cases was: 
     
      
       
        
        “[28] Notwithstanding the caution which needs to be exercised in seeking guidance from other cases of manslaughter, references to decisions similarly involving the killing by the parent or a carer of a young child, by an unlawful and dangerous act, is of some assistance.” 
        
       
      
    38 Wood CJ at CL identified certain principles appropriate for sentencing in such cases as quoted in par [18] above. His Honour did not suggest that the cases to which he referred had established a range in the sense of a sentencing pattern.  
     
      
    39 Manslaughter may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder. (R v Weinman (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252.) This variation is reflected in sentencing. As Dunn LJ said in R v Boyer (1981) 3 Crim App R (S) 35 at 37: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence of manslaughter attracts the widest band of sentences for any offence known to this court. The sentence can vary from life imprisonment to a conditional discharge. It depends on the precise circumstances of the case. It is impossible to subdivide the offence of manslaughter into different categories and say any particular sentence is appropriate to any particular category of events.” 
        
       
      
    40 Similarly, Gleeson CJ pointed out in R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA unreported 12 December 1995) at [4]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances and culpability.” 
        
       
      
    41 It may be possible to identify a distinct category of manslaughter for which variations on a basically similar factual situation can be identified. (See R v Parazisis & Bird (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 245.) However, this can only be done if there is a significant number of cases which share the common characteristic and which represent a very broad range of differing circumstances. Child killing by a parent or carer does not occur so frequently to make it possible to deduce a sentencing pattern from past cases. There is no reason to believe that the six cases referred to by Wood CJ at CL in Woodland cover the relevant range of objective criminality. 
     
      
    42 Plainly a violent attack, albeit not one accompanied by an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, by a person in a position of trust and responsibility upon a defenceless young child, is a circumstance of considerable aggravation. In this sense only can the offence of manslaughter in such cases be regarded as some form of separate category. It is a circumstance of such significance that it is entitled to substantial weight in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The sense of outrage in the community about such a case is so strong that the element of retribution must play a prominent part in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. However, there is such a wide variety of other factors which may accompany this circumstance, that sentences for offences which share only this characteristic would not be expected to result in an identifiable sentencing range or pattern.  
     
      
    43 In the case of manslaughter, as I noted above, the acts constituting the offence and the circumstances of the offender at the time of the offence, may vary over a very wide range of objective gravity. The actual physical assault leading to death can range from comparatively minor force to a sustained beating over a prolonged period of time, incorporating elements of gratuitous cruelty. The personal culpability of the offender may vary from a carer who acts out of despair or in circumstances bordering on accident, to the vicious acts of a sadist.  
     
      
    44 In this regard child killing does not differ from other cases of manslaughter. When sentencing for the offence of manslaughter, a court must always have regard to the full context in which death was caused. That includes consideration of the extent of violence and the risk of death or serious injury which accompany it. It also includes consideration of any matter impinging on the moral culpability of the offender where there was no intention to inflict such injury, which can vary significantly. Where there was such an intention, but murder was reduced to manslaughter by provocation or mental impairment, the degree of provocation or of impairment, also bearing on moral culpability, can also vary significantly. 
     
      
    45 The fact that child killing is not a distinct subcategory of the crime of manslaughter for purposes of sentencing is suggested by a recent study of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, published after his Honour’s sentence in this case. (Judicial Commission of New South Wales Sentenced Homicides in New South Wales 1994-2000 Monograph Series 23, January 2004.)  
     
      
    46 That research shows that over the period of the study, the median sentence for murder or manslaughter of a child did not diverge significantly from the median sentence for other kinds of murders and manslaughters. In the case of manslaughter, non-child killers had sentences in a range from eighteen months to twenty-two years with a median head sentence of seven years, whereas child killers were sentenced in a range of two years to sixteen years, also with a median sentence of seven years. Non-parole periods for manslaughter ranged from nine months to sixteen years in the case of non-child killers with a median of 4.5 years and, in the case of child killers, from eight months to eleven years, with a median of 4.4 years. I should note that the child killers category included both parents or carers and other offenders who were not in a close relationship with their child victims. This research also revealed a significantly lower pattern of sentencing in the case of parents or carers. This result was affected by the number of offenders in that subcategory who claimed diminished responsibility. This manifests how issues of moral culpability must, and do, temper the need for retribution. (See Judicial Commission of New South Wales, supra, esp at pp43, 47, 48-50.) 
     
      
    47 Neither the research, nor the cases set out in Woodland, indicate anything that could be accurately identified as a sentencing pattern for child killers who are in a parental or carer relationship with the victim. That the end results were of a particular character, and could be stated as if they were in a “range”, is not such as could be said to establish a sentencing pattern. 
     
      
    48 As Barr J, with whom Greg James J and Carruthers AJ agreed, said in R v Green [1999] NSWCCA 97: 
     
      
       
        
        “[24] Determining a proper sentence for manslaughter is notoriously difficult. Some assistance may be received from a consideration of the facts of other cases and the sentences imposed therein, but those cases do not determine an inflexible range of available sentences or reduce the maximum penalty applicable to a case which falls into the worst category of cases, namely 25 years penal servitude.” 
        
       
      
    49 Even if no sentencing pattern can be identified, previous sentences are of some utility as a guide, by reason of the significance in the administration of criminal justice of the principle of consistency in sentencing. (See R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 at 168 to 189.) The principle was expressed by Gleeson CJ in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [6] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “All discretionary decision making carries with it the probability of some degree of inconsistency. But there are limits beyond which such inconsistency itself constitutes a forms of injustice. The outcome of discretionary decision making can never be uniform, but it ought to depend as little as possible upon the identity of the judge who happens to hear the case. Like cases should be treated in like manner. The administration of criminal justice works as a system; not merely as a multiplicity of unconnected single instances. It should be systematically fair, and that involves, amongst other things, reasonable consistency.” 
        
       
      
    50 It was for such reasons that Wood CJ at CL in Woodland referred to other decisions for the purpose of “guidance” from which he said he could receive “some assistance” ([28]). He did not refer to them as representing a sentencing range or pattern. 
     
      
    51 In his reasons for judgment Miles AJ regarded the six cases referred to in Woodland as identifying a “range of sentences established by past sentencing practice in this court”. In this, in my opinion, his Honour erred. The cases did not establish a sentencing pattern in that sense.  
     
      
    52 Furthermore, in my opinion, his Honour erred in regarding the starting point in Ditfort as in some way an authoritative indication of an appropriate starting point for purposes of the present case. Ditfort bears some similarities with the present case, but there are also significant differences.  
     
      
    53 In Ditfort there were two blows, one a particularly violent blow of considerable force. In the present case it is clear that the assault involved a number of blows which continued over a longer period. Here the fatal blow may have been of a similar force to that in Ditfort. However the overall assault within which that blow occurred could not be classified as a lashing out in a fit of temper. The violence occurred over a period of time and was accompanied by conduct, bordering on torture, of particular heinousness in the application of clamps to the toes of the baby with sufficient force to break the toes.  
     
      
    54 There is a contrast between the impulsiveness of the crime in Ditfort and the more sustained assault which the evidence indicates must have occurred in the present case. There is also an element of cruelty in the present situation which makes Ditfort an inappropriate benchmark to use as identifying the top of the range appropriate to be applied in the present case. 
     
      
    55 The offender in Ditfort had convictions for dishonesty, but no history of violence. The Respondent in this case had convictions for common assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The element of personal deterrence was, accordingly, entitled to greater weight. 
     
      
    56 The subjective circumstances in Ditfort were of greater force. The judge in that case accepted the applicant’s contrition as true remorse. The findings in this respect in the present case are much weaker.  
     
      
    57 Furthermore, in this case, unlike Ditfort there were additional offences to be taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    58 Another factor differentiating this present case from Ditfort was the fact that the Respondent was on bail for a stealing offence at the time of the offence presently under consideration. 
     
      
    59 The Crown has made out legal error and, subject to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court should proceed to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. 
     
      
       
      Re-sentencing 
       
      
    60 As my comparison with the case of Ditfort would suggest, I am of the opinion that the conduct for which the Respondent is to be sentenced constitutes an offence of greater gravity than that in Ditfort. Accordingly such guidance as can be obtained from that case indicates that the starting point for sentencing in this case should be higher than that in Ditfort.  
     
      
    61 In addition to the cases set out in Woodland, there are seven additional cases of manslaughter by a parent/carer by an unlawful and dangerous act, most decided since Woodland: 
     
      
    · R v Wilson [2003] NSWSC 1257 – Miles AJ, where a sentence of nine years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of six years eleven months, was imposed in respect of a thirty year old female who killed her two year old foster son by shaking him, being an offender who showed no remorse and was not entitled to leniency as a result of youth or inexperience and who voluntarily took on the role as foster carer, and was in a position of trust and authority.  
     
      
    · R v Marshall [2003] NSWSC 448 – Adams J, where a sentence of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months, was imposed in respect of a twenty-two year old man who killed the eleven month old baby of his girlfriend by violently shaking it in an act of unthinking momentary anger, the offender showing remorse and being psychologically impaired.  
     
      
    · R v Folbigg [2003] NSWSC 85 – Barr J, where a sentence of ten years imprisonment with no non-parole period was imposed in respect of a mother who killed her one month old baby by smothering him, in circumstances where the offender was psychologically damaged. The offender was also found guilty of murdering three of her other children and intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm on another of her children, for which she was sentenced respectively to eighteen years, twenty years, twenty-two years and fourteen years imprisonment. Barr J noted that cumulatively, her offences fell into the worst category of cases calling for the imposition of the maximum penalty, but that the offender’s dysfunctional childhood mitigated the criminality.  
     
      
    · R v Webb [2002] NSWSC 618 – Hulme J, where a sentence of seven and a half years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of four and a half years, was imposed in respect of a thirty-seven year old man who killed the three year old daughter of his de facto partner by pushing the infant against a wall, being an Aboriginal offender with above average prospects of rehabilitation, who showed remorse. Reference is made to this not being “a worst case”.  
     
      
    · R v Byrne [2001] NSWSC 1164 – Dunford J, where a sentence of eight and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years was imposed in respect of a mother who killed her five year old son by repeatedly hitting him and immersing him in a bath of overheated water, a reduction of fifteen percent having been allowed for her guilty plea. 
     
      
    · R v Vangelder NSWCCA 28 February 1994 - Gleeson CJ, Newman and Sully JJ, where the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld a sentence of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years in respect of a twenty-four year old woman who killed a four month old baby she was babysitting by forcefully shaking it.  
     
      
    · R v Murdoch NSWCCA 10 December 1998 – Grove, James and Kirby JJ, where the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld a sentence of fifteen years imprisonment with a non-parole period of ten years in respect of a man who killed the three year old son of his de facto by striking the child with a blow to the abdomen and placing him in a cold shower.  
     
      
    62 These cases add to the range of circumstances but not sufficiently to establish a sentencing pattern over the whole of the relevant range. The case of Folbigg involves a higher sentence than that imposed by Miles AJ but has quite unique characteristics. 
     
      
    63 The case of Murdoch also involves a higher sentence. In Murdoch there was a single blow followed by immersion in a cold shower on a cold night. The child died of a combination of the blow and hypothermia. The judgment of this Court does not set out the full range of facts. The severity appeal against a sentence significantly higher than in the present case was dismissed. Grove J, with whom James and Kirby JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The term imposed was undoubtedly high in the range of sentences commonly seen for the crime of manslaughter but it has frequently been observed that this is a crime which covers a broad spectrum of culpability. The facts found by his Honour show the applicant’s offence was in the more serious category … .” 
        
       
      
    64 The gratuitous cruelty by the immersion in the shower bears some comparison with the application of the clamp to the toes in the present case. However, Murdoch involved only a single blow. It is, nevertheless, closer to the present case than Ditfort. 
     
      
    65 In the present case, the injury or blow that actually caused the death cannot be determined with precision. The evidence of the paediatric surgeon set out in par [14] above indicates that any one of three blows could have caused the child to vomit which, upon inhalation, resulted in death. The most forceful blow was that to the face which caused the injury to the palate and the splatter of blood on the mattress, wall and, it appears most likely, to the shorts of the Respondent. The blow or blows to the chest with fracturing of ribs was a second possible cause. The third was the blow to the liver. Whichever of the blows caused the death does not need to be determined. Each was of a similar order of culpability.  
     
      
    66 The fact that the fatal blow occurred in the course of a prolonged violent attack elevates the level of culpability of the offender to a high order. That fatal blow was accompanied by at least two other blows, and probably more, any one of which could have been fatal. Furthermore, the conduct of the offender included the aggravating conduct of dragging the body of the baby over a surface, such as a carpet or a sofa, face down causing a number of facial injuries. Over and above that is the gratuitous cruelty of an almost grotesque character by the application of clamps to both feet of the deceased baby Jordan with sufficient force to break his toes. That conduct was not fatal and he is not to be sentenced for it as if it were an element constituting the offence. It does, however, make this a crime in which the conduct of the Respondent was of a high level of objective gravity as an incident of the overall conduct leading to the fatal blow.  
     
      
    67 This context in which the particular fatal blow was delivered indicates that the moral culpability attending the act which caused death was of a very high order. No explanation of any kind was offered on the part of the Respondent during the course of the sentencing hearing. All that there was were self-serving statements to an independent professional, in the course of an assessment for purposes of the sentencing hearing, a most unsatisfactory basis for putting such facts before a sentencing court. In those statements the Respondent sought to deflect his own responsibility by suggesting that his conduct, which he never admitted as going beyond two blows, was suggested by Ms Anderson. This version of the events, as well as the suggestion that all that had occurred was only two blows with an open hand, was rejected by Miles AJ.  
     
      
    68 There was nothing that could mitigate the moral culpability of the conduct at the time of the offence. Nor was there any other aspect of the position of the offender, either at the time of the offence or subsequently, that justified any substantial mitigation, other than the plea of guilty. The Respondent had a record, including offences involving violence. He was on bail at the time of the offence for which he stood to be sentenced. The expressions of remorse, again in the unsatisfactory form of untestable statements to a professional, duly recorded in a report for purposes of the proceedings by a person who has no reason to question the assertions and does no more than pass them on as assertions made by the offender, are entitled to little weight by reason of their limited content and the unsatisfactory manner in which the evidence was presented to the Court. 
     
      
    69 The plea of guilty is entitled to some weight for its utilitarian value. However, the offer to plead to manslaughter occurred only at the end of the Crown case. It is not apparent, on the materials before this Court, why the offer was accepted in full discharge of the Crown case for murder. As a verdict of manslaughter was always an available option, it could not be said that this offer occurred at an early time. Indeed it occurred very late. His Honour assessed the utilitarian value of the plea at ten percent and that seems appropriate. 
     
      
    70 The well-established principles of double jeopardy apply when this Court comes to re-sentence after a successful Crown appeal. The Court is obliged, in accordance with authority, not to set a sentence at the high end of the range appropriate to the particular case, namely a sentence which, although high, would have survived a severity appeal. The Court should impose the least sentence that should have been imposed by the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    71 As Gleeson CJ said in R v Rose (NSWCCA 23 May 1996 unreported) at p3, subsequently applied in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 409 at 232: 
     
      
       
        
        “….. when re-sentencing a respondent on a successful Crown appeal this Court gives weight to the circumstances of double jeopardy involved in a Crown appeal by imposing a sentence that is the least sentence that could properly have been imposed upon the respondent at first instance”. 
        
       
      
    72 It may be that this test is not consistent with other authorities in this Court. (See R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 256C-D and 269F-270A; R v Hallocoglu (1991) 29 NSWLR 67 at 80F-81A.) In my opinion, the test propounded by Gleeson CJ in Rose should be applied in the present case. It may, however, be appropriate for a bench of five to consider, on some future occasion, the appropriate approach to resentencing on a successful Crown appeal. 
     
      
    73 In my opinion, the appropriate starting point, on this basis, was a sentence of sixteen years which after a ten percent reduction for the plea becomes a sentence of fourteen years and four months. There are no special circumstances which would justify reducing the statutory ratio. The non-parole period should be ten years and nine months. 
     
      
    74 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      i Crown Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      ii Sentence imposed by Miles AJ on 11 December 2003 quashed. 
       
       
      iii The Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years and four months commencing on 5 October 2001 and to expire on 4 February 2016. 
       
       
      iv The non-parole period is fixed at ten years and nine months commencing on 5 October 2001 and expiring on 4 July 2012. 
       
      
    75 HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice. Subject to the matters referred to below, I generally agree with them. His Honour’s account of the circumstances of the offence, of the remarks of the sentencing judge and of the issues which arise on the appeal means that I can be brief. 
     
      
    76 In the course of his Remarks on Sentence, Miles AJ said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[40] I understand that sentences of less than 25 years have been imposed for murder in recent years. Unless and until there is a single offence of homicide in which murder and manslaughter are undifferentiated, I think that it would be entirely against the tradition and history of the criminal law to allow a situation to develop where the crime of murder could be treated as less serious than manslaughter except in the clearest and most exceptional circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        [41] Further, to impose the maximum penalty for the present offence, or indeed, to impose a sentence of substantially more than ten years, is so far beyond the range of sentences established by past sentencing practice in this Court in recent years that to do so is not the task of a judge at first instance but of the Court of Criminal Appeal if it is minded to do so, and then, as I understand it, only after an indication that the past practice is to be changed.” 
        
       
      
    77 In my view the Crown has made out its contention that the first of the paragraphs contains both error and error which affected his Honour’s conclusion as to the appropriate sentence to impose. Notwithstanding the argument to the contrary, the words used seem to me to indicate that his Honour was stating a reason for concluding he could not or should not impose a higher sentence. The reason stated is wrong. The range of sentences for manslaughter is from nothing to imprisonment for 25 years. The range for murder is from nothing (though it would be an extraordinary and perhaps inconceivable case for that to occur) to life imprisonment. Although it would be an unusual case of manslaughter which would justify a sentence above the range of sentences usually imposed for murder, and in the course of sentencing for manslaughter it is not inappropriate to reflect on the sentences imposed for the generally more serious offence, it is wrong to regard sentences for murder, whether these be low in, or in the middle of, the murder range as necessarily limiting the sentences to be imposed for manslaughter. 
     
      
    78 I am also unable to agree with the sentence proposed by the Chief Justice and with his Honour’s starting point of 16 years. 
     
      
    79 The helplessness of infants and young children mean that not only do they need protection by adult members of the human race, they have no capacity to defend themselves from aggression by such adults. By reason of the relationship the Respondent established with the mother of his victim, the Respondent came under an obligation, if not to provide that protection, to at least ensure he did not depart from the rules of fundamental decency and respect for the rights of the helpless child. 
     
      
    80 Of course, what I have just said would be appropriate in virtually all of the too many cases of the manslaughter of infants which come before the courts and almost all of those have not had sentences of the order of that I propose here. What distinguishes this case from almost all others is the extent and, one may infer, the duration of the violence used, the gratuitous cruelty obviously employed, and the complete absence of any excuse or explanation – or at least one consistent with normal humanity – for the Respondent’s actions. 
     
      
    81 In combination, the matters referred to in the two immediately preceding paragraphs cry out in this case for retribution to be given a much larger role than commonly afforded to it. As this Court said in R v Gordon (unreported, CCA, 7 February 1994):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Retribution, or the taking of vengeance for the injury which was done by the offender, is also an important aspect of sentencing:  
        Regina v Goodrich 
         (1952) 70 WN 42 at 43;  
        Regina v Cuthbert  
        (1967) 86 WN (Pt 1) 272 at 274;  
        Regina v Rushby 
         (at 598). Not only must the community be satisfied that the offender is given his just deserts, it is important as well that the victim, or those who are left behind, also feel that justice has been done.” 
        
       
      
    82 Those matters also lead me to the conclusion that the Respondent’s offence, although manslaughter, was worse than many cases of murder with which the courts have to deal. His record, indicating either a disposition for violence or an ability to control himself also argues for a longer rather than a shorter sentence. However, such was the Respondent’s criminality here, demonstrated by the matters to which I have referred, that this past almost fades into insignificance by comparison. 
     
      
    83 Given that the Respondent’s plea was only indicated after the Crown case at his trial had concluded, I am far from convinced that the Respondent is entitled to a discount of 10% for that plea. However, Miles J granted a discount of that order, and this is a Crown appeal. In the circumstances, I am content for the Respondent to receive that discount. 
     
      
    84 Although had I been the sentencing judge I would have imposed a higher sentence, I accept that in the circumstances of this Crown appeal, it is appropriate that the sentence imposed by this Court be at the bottom of the range for his offence. These days, that is the usual practice although not one which must invariably be followed – see e.g. R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 256; R v Hallocoglu (1991) 29 NSWLR 67 at 80F and my discussion of the topic in R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2 at [204 et seq]. 
     
      
    85 In my view, the commencing point in the determination of any sentence to be imposed on the Respondent should be not less than 18 years. I appreciate that this is but 2 years more than the figure proposed by the Chief Justice but such was the Respondent’s criminality that I regard any lesser figure than the 18 years to which I have referred as inadequate. However, as mine is a dissenting view, I need not take the matter further. 
     
      
    86 ADAMS J: I have read the judgment in draft of the Chief Justice and agree with his Honour’s conclusions with one qualification. 
     
      
    87 This is undoubtedly a very serious case of manslaughter. As follows from the post mortem report, the Respondent had seriously assaulted Jordan in a number of different ways. For the purpose of sentence, of course, it must be assumed that the Respondent did not intend death or grievous bodily harm to result. However, it is inescapable that his violence was intentional, repeated and severe. The state of mind with which the Respondent inflicted tis violence is illustrated by the cruel and clearly vindictive injuries to Jordan’s foot, almost certainly caused by a metal clamp, demonstrating that his violence was not impulsive but acts of calculated cruelty. Where death is caused by such acts, the crime is very grave, even if this result is unintentional and unforeseen. 
     
      
    88 The Chief Justice has analysed a number of cases involving the manslaughter of children. These cases demonstrate the wide variety of circumstances and offenders that come for sentence under this rubric. If I may say so with respect, the sentence proposed by the Chief Justice is certainly within the range of sentence available to be properly imposed against this Respondent in the particular circumstances of this case. I am unable to agree, however, that it is “the least sentence that could properly have been imposed”, vide Gleeson CJ in R v Rose (unreported NSWCCA 23 May 1996). In so formulating the test, I am mindful of and agree with the Chief Justice’s observation about the need to reconsider it. I note that Gleeson CJ added that the sentence that he proposed in the case is, because of the implicit double jeopardy, “somewhat less than what I would have thought would have been a proper sentence at first instance”. In particular, the fact that the offender’s sentence is to be increased in a Crown appeal, by itself, is a relevant consideration affecting re-sentence which, of course, is irrelevant at first instance; furthermore, the offender has taken steps towards rehabilitation since his sentence which should be given some acknowledgement, although the objective gravity of his crime does not permit any significant adjustment under this head; and the respondent has been placed in the necessarily anxious and stressful situation of awaiting the outcome of the appeal, which has added to his punishment (although notice of appeal was given on 16 December 2003 it did not come on for hearing until 17 May 2004). 
     
      
    89 At all events, in my view, with respect, a starting point, before the utilitarian discount of fourteen years would not have been appealably wrong. Such an assessment is, of course, very much a question of judgment. In the circumstances of this case, having regard to the views of both the Chief Justice and Hulme J, I am not prepared to press my own view to dissent. 
     
      
    90 Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Howie J 
     
      
       
      Background 
      
    3 HOWIE J: In this matter both the offender and Crown are dissatisfied with sentences imposed by Judge Sides QC in the Campbelltown District Court on 10 December 2003. Although there is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence, I think it is more appropriate, given the way the matter proceeded before the Court, to refer throughout this judgment to the offender as the respondent. Judge Sides sentenced the respondent for a number of child sexual assault offences to an overall sentence of imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. The sentences commenced on 28 November 2000 and the respondent is eligible for parole on 10 December 2010. 
     
      
    4 The sentencing proceedings for the offences before the Court have an unfortunate history. On 21 July 2003 the respondent was before this Court in answer to a Crown appeal against sentences purportedly imposed upon him by Acting Judge Moore. The sentences related to the very same offences as are subject to the present proceedings. The respondent first pleaded guilty to these matters in the Local Court on 29 May 2002. On 4 December 2002 Moore ADCJ purportedly sentenced the respondent to imprisonment to an overall sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. Those sentences dated from 28 November 2000 and the respondent was to be eligible to be released to parole on 27 November 2006. The Crown then appealed against the asserted leniency of those sentences. Without determining the Crown appeal, this Court quashed the sentences because of a number of technical errors in the sentences, not the least being that his Honour had failed to give reasons at the time of sentencing the respondent and his two co-offenders. See R v CJP [2003] NSWCCA 187. 
     
      
    5 As a result of the quashing of the sentences the proceedings were re-commenced before Judge Sides, who, as should be apparent, imposed a heavier sentence upon the respondent than did Moore ADCJ. 
     
      
    6 The respondent contends that Judge Sides erred in failing to have any, or sufficient regard to the sentences purportedly imposed upon him by Acting Judge Moore. It was submitted that, by reason of that failure, the sentencing discretion exercised by Judge Sides miscarried and that this Court should re-exercise the discretion taking into account the sentences that Acting Judge Moore had intended to impose. In effect the Court was asked to reimpose the sentences that Moore ADCJ had determined were appropriate but that he had failed to effectively pass upon the respondent. 
     
      
    7 The Crown contends that the sentences imposed by Judge Sides are still manifestly inadequate. It is also asserted that his Honour made a number of errors in determining the sentences such that his discretion miscarried. These errors included, what the Crown alleges was, double counting when taking into account the delay and “triple jeopardy” arising from the history of the sentencing proceedings summarised above. 
     
      
    8 As has already been noted, the respondent initially pleaded guilty in the Local Court. He was committed for sentence to the District Court under 51A of the Justices Act (now repealed). The respondent asked Acting Judge Moore to take into account a number of matters, of a similar nature to the offences for which he was to be sentenced, on a Form 1. He made the same request of Judge Sides. The respondent, therefore, was to be sentenced for five offences for which he had been committed for sentence and was to have taken into account, in relation to the third committal charge, five offences on a Form 1. 
     
      
       
      The charges 
      
    9 The first offence for which the respondent was committed for sentence was an offence of having sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16 years. That offence occurred between 17 October 2000 and 27 October 2000 and was committed against a complainant, ELP, who was, at the time of the commission of the offence, aged 13. That offence was contrary to s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 8 years. 
     
      
    10 The second committal charge was in the same terms as the first charge on the committal document and involved the same complainant. 
     
      
    11 The third committal charge alleged that between 14 November 2000 and 15 November 2000 the respondent had sexual intercourse with ELP without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting to sexual intercourse, in circumstances of aggravation, being that she was under the age of 16 years, she being aged 13. This is an offence contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. 
     
      
    12 The fourth committal charge was in the same terms as charge 3 and was committed against ELP. 
     
      
    13 The fifth charge alleged that between 14 November 2000 and 15 November 2000 the respondent had sexual intercourse with GS without his consent and knowing that he was not consenting to the sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation being that at the time of the offence GS was under the age of 16 years, being then aged 13 years. This is also an offence contrary to s 61J. 
     
      
    14 In respect of the third committal charge the respondent asked his Honour to take into account five matters each being a sexual assault offence and were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) That on or about 14 November 2000 he incited GS who was then aged 13 to perform an act of indecency towards him. This is an offence contrary to s 61N(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . 
         
         
        (b) That on or about 14 November 2000 had sexual intercourse with SD without her consent in circumstances of aggravation being that she was under the age of 16 years, being 10 years. 
         
         
        (c) That on or about 15 November 2000 he attempted to have homosexual intercourse with GS, he being 10 to 18 years, namely 13 years. This is an offence contrary to s 78L. 
         
         
        (d) That between 1 January 2000 and 15 November 2000 he had sexual intercourse with GS without his consent and in circumstances of aggravation namely that he was under the age of 16 years, he being 13 years. 
         
         
        (e) That between 1 January 2000 and 15 November 2000 he had sexual intercourse with GS without his consent in circumstances of aggravation being that he was then under the age of 16 years namely 13 years. 
        
       
      
    15 On 10 December 2003 Judge Sides imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Charges 1 & 2 imprisonment for 3 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 28 November 2000. 
         
         
        Charge 3 imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years to commence on 28 November 2002. 
         
         
        Charge 4 imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 28 November 2002. 
         
         
        Charge 5 imprisonment for 5½ years with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 28 November 2002. 
        
       
       
       
      The facts 
      
    16 The charges and the offences on the Form 1 all arose from a relationship in which the respondent was involved with two female co-offenders, who will be referred to as CAD and MES. The complainant ELP was the daughter of the respondent’s former wife. The complainant GS was the son of MES. The complainant SD was the daughter of CAD. The children each regarded the respondent as a father or stepfather. At the time of the commission of the offences the respondent was aged between 43 and 44. 
     
      
    17 At the relevant time the respondent was living with MES in a de-facto relationship that had existed for about 6 years. There were two children in that household, GS, the 13-year old son of MES, and a daughter of the respondent and CAD aged 2. Living nearby was CAD. She had been involved in a relationship with the respondent and had three children to him aged 7 and 3 and a very young baby. 
     
      
    18 In October 2000 ELP, the 13-year old daughter of the respondent’s former wife, came to live with him and MES. ELP regarded the respondent as her father. She had left her mother’s home as a result of difficulties she was experiencing at school and in her relationship with her mother. 
     
      
    19 The first offence chronologically was number 4 on the Form 1. It involved the respondent inciting GS to have sexual intercourse with his mother while the respondent watched them. 
     
      
    20 The next offence was number 5 on the Form 1. The respondent incited GS to have intercourse with CAD while the respondent was present and watching. The respondent told GS not to tell anyone or he would “bash him”. 
     
      
    21 In respect of these two offences his Honour found that there were two circumstances of aggravation namely the age of GS and the breach of trust involved as the respondent was in the position of stepfather to the child. Judge Sides also found that the respondent was the instigator of the offences and had engineered the circumstances in which the offences could be committed. 
     
      
    22 The next offence was the first charge for which the respondent had been committed for sentence. The child ELP was taken by MES into a room where the respondent was lying on a bed, naked apart from a towel around his waist. The child was told to remove her clothes and to lie on the bed. The respondent then had vaginal intercourse with her. The child was crying during this assault. When she asked whether he was finished, he said that he had not come and continued. It was her first sexual experience and MES stood beside the bed throughout intercourse, holding her hand. 
     
      
    23 The second offence on the committal document occurred later that same evening, although MES was not present. The respondent performed anal intercourse upon ELP. 
     
      
    24 The next offence was the first matter on the form 1 and occurred on or about 14 November 2000. This offence occurred at the home of CAD although she was not present. The respondent telephoned MES and asked her to bring ELP to the house where the respondent was with GS, SD and a third child. In the presence of SD, who was then aged 10, the respondent told GS to remove his clothes and to masturbate the respondent. 
     
      
    25 The next offence was the third matter on the form 1 and occurred on about 15 November 2000. The respondent attempted to insert his penis into the anus of GS who resisted him and the respondent was unable to complete the act. 
     
      
    26 The next offence occurred about the same time and was the third charge on the committal document. This involved the respondent having penile intercourse with ELP during which he ejaculated inside her. The complainant told police she was screaming and asked him to stop but he refused and slapped her face on one occasion. 
     
      
    27 The next offence was charge four on the committal document and occurred immediately after charge three. The respondent rolled ELP on to her stomach and inserted his penis into her anus. Judge Sides held that both this and the previous offence had been aggravated by both the age of the child and that she was under the respondent’s authority. 
     
      
    28 The next offence was the fifth charge on the committal document and occurred at about the same time as the previous two offences. The respondent forced GS to perform fellatio on him by holding his head over his penis. This act occurred in the presence of the children SD and ELP. 
     
      
    29 The last offence occurred on or about 14 November and was the second matter on the Form 1. In the presence of both ELP and GS the respondent placed his finger in the vagina of SD, who was then aged 10 years. The respondent told SD to push his finger into her vagina. Judge Sides found that this offence was aggravated by the age of the child and the position of trust in which the respondent held the child. 
     
      
    30 The offending came to an end when the children made complaint to school authorities in October and November 2000. 
     
      
    31 The respondent at the time of sentence before Judge Sides was aged 47. He has a criminal record for matters in the Children’s Court. He also has a number of convictions for offences of dishonesty and driving matters in both NSW and the Northern Territory as an adult. He has served short gaol sentences although many years ago. The respondent’s antecedents do not really impact upon the appropriate sentence to be imposed for his sexual conduct against the children. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The sentencing proceedings 
      
    32 The respondent gave evidence before both Acting Judge Moore and Judge Sides. A transcript of his evidence in the earlier proceedings was tendered in the latter. Before Moore ADCJ the respondent gave evidence that he himself had been a victim of sexual abuse, although he had not told a psychiatrist preparing a report for those proceedings about this assertion. He said that this was because he had not been asked about it. He said that he had been abused when he was aged 8 years by an adult male who fondled his genitals. He asserted that he had also been subject to further abuse when in a boys’ home and while a prisoner in the Northern Territory.  
     
      
    33 He said that he accepted responsibility for his offending, that he was ashamed of what he had done and that he deserved whatever sentence the judge determined to impose upon him. In cross-examination he said that he felt sorry for what he had done immediately after the first offence committed against ELD, but continued to offend. 
     
      
    34 In evidence before Judge Sides the respondent said that the lodging of the appeal by the Crown in respect of the sentences imposed by Acting Judge Moore had affected his classification and resulted in harsher conditions than might otherwise have been the case. He was housed in protection but was hoping eventually to enter into a sexual offender’s course. 
     
      
    35 A psychiatric report by Dr Carne was tendered. It contained allegations of physical abuse by his father but made no mention of sexual abuse by any person. The respondent left school at 14 and travelled interstate with his father who was looking for work. After the death of one of his six children in 1991, the respondent had become depressed and turned to alcohol abuse. He had not worked since 1998. Dr Carne formed the view that the respondent was remorseful, had insight into his criminal behaviour, and was seeking assistance in relation to his abuse of alcohol. He thought that his behaviour was the direct result of decreased inhibition as a result of intoxication. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing remarks 
      
    36 In sentencing the respondent Judge Sides stated that the head sentence and the non-parole period “ha[d] been modified to reflect the delay and the triple jeopardy”. This was a reference to the fact that the respondent had been sentenced by Moore ADCJ, subjected to a Crown appeal, and then resentenced by his Honour. Judge Sides cited in this regard R v Wong and Leung [2002] NSWCCA 169. That was a case where this Court was resentencing the respondents for a second time after a successful Crown appeal, and then a successful appeal by the respondents to the High Court. They were thus being sentenced for the third time and the Court considered this “triple jeopardy” to be a relevant factor. The Crown has asserted that Judge Sides gave too much weight to this factor and I shall return to it shortly. 
     
      
    37 His Honour took into account the report of Dr Carne and, in particular that the respondent may have been “abusing liquor as a form of self-medication for grief and depression”. His Honour thought that this might have entitled the respondent to some leniency and referred to R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 436 in this regard. His Honour’s misconception about what Wood CJ at CL said about intoxication in Henry was the basis of a Crown appeal in R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291. Whealy J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, pointed out that there was nothing in the judgment in Henry that suggested that the taking of drugs as “self-medication” was a mitigating factor. 
     
      
    38 The Crown does not take the point in the present case, no doubt because his Honour determined that the respondent’s consumption of alcohol could not be a mitigating factor in the circumstances of the present case. His Honour correctly, with respect, recognised that the respondent had conceded in evidence that he knew that what he had done to ELD was wrong immediately after committing the first offence against her and yet he continued to consume alcohol and re-offend in that way. 
     
      
    39 His Honour noted that the respondent was in protective custody and that as a result imprisonment was more burdensome than might otherwise have been the case. His Honour sentenced the respondent on the basis that he would serve the balance of his sentence in protection but that situation may be ameliorated to some extent if, and when, he participates in a sexual offenders course. 
     
      
    40 Judges Sides took into account as a mark of contrition that the respondent had volunteered to give evidence against one of his co-offenders but that offer had not been taken up by the Crown. 
     
      
    41 His Honour noted that the offences against ELD had occurred shortly after she had come to live with the respondent and at a time when he child was particularly vulnerable because of her difficulties at school and in her relationship with her mother. He also referred to the significant injuries suffered by ELD as a result of the respondent’s forceful penetration of her. 
     
      
    42 His Honour found that the respondent’s pleas of guilty were made at the earliest opportunity, that he was contrite and that the victims had been saved the anxiety of giving evidence. He allowed a discount of 25 per cent. 
     
      
    43 In referring to the matters on the Form 1 his Honour is quoted in the sentencing remarks as saying (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        In accordance with principle, in sentencing for the matter where the offences on the form 1 schedule are to be taken into account, I have borne in mind how those matters should reflect on the issues of  
        rehabilitation 
         and deterrence”. 
        
       
       
      The Crown relies upon this statement as an error in that his Honour took into account rehabilitation when giving effect to the matters on the Form 1. 
       
      
    44 It seems to me that this remark makes no sense unless the word “rehabilitation” is read as “retribution”. If the remark is considered with that correction, it makes perfect sense and is in accord with what was said by this Court about the effect of Form 1 matters in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 where at [42] Spigelman CJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 
          
        33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 
        
       
      
    45 At the conclusion of his sentencing remarks, Judge Sides emphasised the need for both general and specific deterrence. He noted that he was not sentencing on the basis that each of the charges was an isolated incident. He assessed the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation as “average”. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal 
      
    46 The respondent’s dissatisfaction with the sentence imposed by Judge Sides is, in effect, that his Honour increased the sentence imposed by Acting Judge Moore in circumstances where the sentences had been set aside on the basis of a technicality by this Court without any consideration of the merits of the Crown appeal against those sentences. It was submitted that the respondent had a justifiable sense of grievance with the outcome of the sentencing proceedings because the sentences imposed by Moore ADCJ had been quashed through no fault of the respondent. 
     
      
    47 In support of this argument the respondent relied upon the practice or convention that attends upon sentencing after a re-trial following a successful appeal against conviction. In such a case the practice is that the offender should not ordinarily receive a lengthier sentence or non-parole period than that imposed following the first trial. This practice was identified in R v Gilmore (1979) 1 A Crim R 416 at 419. It has most recently been the subject of consideration in R v MM (2002) 135 A Crim R 431. These cases emphasise, as do others, the discretion that resides in the second court to increase the original sentence where that court believes that the circumstances call for such a result. 
     
      
    48 The policy considerations that support this practice are, firstly, that an offender should not be deterred from pursuing a justified appeal by the fear of an increased sentence after retrial and, secondly, that there should not be a perception, even though unjustified, that the offender is being punished for succeeding in having the original conviction overturned on appeal. I have difficulty in seeing how either of those considerations supports an adoption of the practice in the circumstances of the present case. 
     
      
    49 MM was a case where the applicant had been convicted on retrial of fewer offences than on the first trial, yet received the same overall sentence. I expressed the view that it was not appropriate to apply the practice outside the factual situation in which it had developed and where specific policy considerations justifying its adoption had no relevance. The other members of the Court were prepared to act on the basis that the practice did apply but that there were good reasons for the sentencing judge to depart from it. 
     
      
    50 I appreciate that the applicant may feel aggrieved that his sentences were increased without this Court determining whether the length of the overall sentence imposed by Acting Judge Moore was inadequate, but that is no reason itself, in my view, for determining that the discretion of Judge Sides must have miscarried. His Honour was clearly aware of the history of the matter and the sentences imposed by Acting Judge Moore, but he determined, for lengthy and considered reasons that he gave, what he thought the appropriate sentence should be. It is not necessarily indicative of error that his assessment of the appropriate sentence differed from that determined by Acting Judge Moore. Not all grievances, whether justified or not, can be redressed within a system of justice that recognises that individual judges have independent sentencing discretions. 
     
      
    51 In any event, as the respondent’s counsel accepted at the hearing before this Court, the respondent’s complaints may evaporate if the Crown appeal is resolved against him. I move then to consider the Crown appeal. 
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
      
    52 The Crown contends that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and that his Honour’s exercise of the sentencing discretion was flawed by specific errors manifest in his sentencing remarks. One specific error raised related to what his Honour said about the use to be made of the Form 1 matters. I have already dealt with that complaint, and in my view it has no substance when the remarks are corrected to remove what appears to be a slip by his Honour or a typographical error. 
     
      
       
      Failure to cumulate sentences for counts 4 and 5 
      
    53 The Crown complains that his Honour failed to structure the sentences to reflect appropriately the criminality that was before him. In particular it is submitted that his Honour should have imposed at least partially cumulative sentences for the committal charges numbers 4 and 5 as the criminality in charge 3 and the Form 1 matters could not embrace the criminality involved in the last two charges. 
     
      
    54 The third charge related to the sexual assault upon ELP by forced sexual intercourse. It was an offence under s 61J(1) and carried a maximum penalty of 20 years. His Honour, taking into account the Form 1 matters, imposed a sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. That sentence commenced at the expiration of the non-parole period for the first charge, being 27 November 2002. 
     
      
    55 The fourth charge was the anal intercourse of ELP that followed a short time after the intercourse in the third charge. His Honour imposed a sentence that was concurrent with the third charge. The fifth charge related to the forced act of fellatio by GS upon the applicant. Both of these offences carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. While the fourth charge was related to the third in that the complainant was the same, the fifth was a separate act of serious criminality against a different complainant and one not the subject of any of the other committal charges. 
     
      
    56 One of the difficulties in the present matter was the fact that the Form 1 included offences against three different complainants, one of whom was GS. It also included the very serious offence of digital penetration on SD a child aged 10 who was not the subject of a charge. I have considerable doubt that this was an appropriate method of proceeding and it was one very likely to lead a sentencing judge into error. 
     
      
       
      Sentence erroneous 
      
    57 In any event, I accept the Crown submission that the sentence imposed for charge 3 and the Form 1 matters could not appropriately comprehend the criminality involved in charge 5 involving, as it did, a 13 year old boy being forced to fellate the applicant in front of ELD while the applicant was in a position of authority over both children. If his Honour was correct, as I believe he was, in holding that an appropriate sentence to impose for the fifth charge was imprisonment for 5½ years, how could an act of criminality warranting such a sentence be encompassed within a sentence that reflected the serious criminal activity involved in count 3 and having regard to the matters on the form 1, including as they did the offence involving SD? 
     
      
    58 My immediate impression was that the overall sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences before the Court, and that impression is borne out by a more detailed examination of the structure of the sentences and the criminality involved in each of the offences for which sentence was passed. The failure to cumulate appropriately resulted in an overall sentence that is so far short of what was necessary to punish the respondent that this Court should intervene notwithstanding the principles which govern Crown appeals and are conveniently set out in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]. The necessary adjustment of the sentences can in no way be described as “tinkering” notwithstanding the length of the sentences involved. 
     
      
    59 I do not understand anything said in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 205 ALR 346 to suggest that a sentencing judge can impose concurrent sentences where to do so would fail to reflect the totality of the criminality involved in the offences for which sentence is being imposed, or to permit a sentencing judge to inflate the sentence for one offence to encompass the criminality of another. See also R v Hayes [2004] NSWCCA 156 per Levine J at [28]. In any event an effective sentence of 9 years imprisonment does not in my view sufficiently reflect the seriousness of the offences involved in charges 3,4 and 5 and the matters on the form 1, and a head sentence of 11 years fails to a very marked degree to denounce the conduct of the respondent and to provide sufficient retribution for his abuse of these children. 
     
      
    60 I appreciate that to a very significant degree a determination that a sentence is manifestly inadequate is a personal reaction to the sentence imposed as against the objective and subjective facts. The same may be said of a finding that a sentence is manifestly excessive. Of course the consequences of the two findings are so different, at least as they impact upon the offender, that the court must approach the former finding with considerable circumspection and temper the personal reaction to the sentence with due regard to the discretion that resides in the sentencing judge and the limitations on this Court to intervene on behalf of the Crown. 
     
      
    61 I have refrained from using epithets to describe the conduct of the respondent in order to maintain judicial equanimity. However, the offending was of a most serious nature and the circumstances in which the offences were committed are replete with aggravating features. These may not be quite the worst type of offences of their nature but they are not far from it. Concern or sympathy for the respondent by reason of the history of the sentencing proceedings can go only so far in ameliorating the punishment that such offences deserve and that the community expects. 
     
      
    62 Considerations such as “triple jeopardy’ and the uncertainty and frustration felt by the respondent must not be disregarded but they have to be weighed against the seriousness of the offences and the public interest in appropriate punishment being imposed on offenders notwithstanding their personal circumstances. Double jeopardy, or even triple jeopardy, is not a concept that is to be considered in a vacuum. The uncertainty or disappointment experienced by the respondent as a result of the Crown appeal and the failure of Acting Judge Moore to impose the sentence he intended cannot be compared with that of an offender who, for example, does not know whether he will be required to serve a gaol sentence pending the outcome of a Crown appeal or one who has the expectation of an early release date frustrated by a failure of the sentencing judge properly to exercise the sentencing discretion at first instance. 
     
      
    63 In the present case I am not persuaded that the effect upon the respondent of the failure of the judicial system to punish him appropriately is such that it should operate significantly in his favour or should relieve a court from doing its duty to protect the public. Nor should it dissuade this Court from intervening when it is confronted by a sentence that so far falls short of what was required. To the extent that his Honour may have imposed this sentence as a result of overly taking into account triple jeopardy and delay in the finalisation of the sentencing proceedings, he erred. 
     
      
    64 In coming to this view I take into account that Judge Sides was mistaken in believing that the offences, or some of them, were committed while the respondent was on bail for a traffic offence. The Crown concedes that the respondent had failed to appear in respect of a Court Attendance Notice and therefore was not subject to any undertaking as to future conduct, as would be the case had he been arrested and released on bail. However, in the circumstances of this particular matter and having regard to the nature of the offence for which he was to attend court, I do not believe that as a factor of aggravation it would have been a matter of any significant moment. In any event, the sentence is so inadequate that his Honour’s discretion miscarried in some other more fundamental way. 
     
      
    65 I accept that the present offences were not part of an ongoing abuse of a child over many years, but that consideration does not avail the respondent. The offences were committed in circumstances that discovery was unlikely given the complicity of the two other adults who might have offered protection to the children. There is little doubt that the conduct would have continued had not ELD had the fortitude to bring the matter to the attention of school authorities. Judge Sides did not treat these as isolated instances and the offences commenced against ELD shortly after she arrived at the premises in circumstances where the respondent knew that she was having trouble in her relationship with her mother and at school. There is no doubt that the respondent used his influence over the two women to obtain their assistance, and that is a matter of particular aggravation. The commission of the offences so blatantly in front of other children is an aggravating feature that I have not encountered before. 
     
      
    66 The delay in these matters being finalised is a relevant consideration but again it is a matter that has to be considered in context. The effects of delay referred to in R v Blanco (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 were not significant in the present case. I have already referred to the uncertainty in which the respondent was left by reason of the history of the sentencing proceedings, but he must have been certain that he was to serve a lengthy sentence before he had any prospect of release to parole or otherwise. His demonstrated rehabilitation during the period was not a matter that loomed large, and the offences could in no way be regarded as stale. 
     
      
    67 The respondent’s protective status was a relevant matter but as was recognised in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 at [178] the sentences imposed for offences of this kind have involved in them an element of leniency because of the conditions in which offenders find themselves because of the reaction of other prisoners to their crimes. Again it is a matter that is added into the mix of the various objective and subjective factors and the relevant purposes of punishment that resolve themselves into an appropriate sentence. There was material placed before this Court as to his current prison status and the effect that any increase in his sentence might have upon his custodial position. 
     
      
    68 This Court has been referred to a number of decisions of this Court on the basis that they indicate a range of sentencing for such offences. They have limited value because of the varying factors involved in what is an exercise of discretion and their limited number. Simply having regard to the number of children involved or the nature of the sexual acts committed cannot determine the seriousness of the offences before the Court or those in other cases, upon which reliance is placed on behalf of the applicant. I doubt that sentences thought to be appropriate in 1993 are necessarily a sound guide to sentencing in 2003 in light of the increasing awareness and concern about such offences in the intervening period. In any event I consider that the criminality of the respondent was considerably greater than those of the applicants in the decisions to which the Court was referred. For example, I do not consider offences by a schoolteacher, as serious as they might be, to be the equivalent, or anything like it, of offences as grave as these committed by a person in the position of a father or stepfather. 
     
      
    69 There are offences that, because of the manner in which they are committed and the circumstances surrounding them, simply stand out from the usual run of offences of their kind and for that reason call for punishment of a particularly severe nature. The sentences imposed for such matters may fall outside the range that might otherwise be considered as applicable, simply because the offences fall outside the normal range of offending. These were in my opinion offences of that nature. They were such that the applicant deserves to be treated as an example to others in the community and there is nothing in the material relating to his personal circumstances, that was placed before the sentencing judge or this Court that, to my mind, indicates that such an approach is inappropriate. 
     
      
    70 The applicant had the benefit of a finding of special circumstances by Judge Sides. I do not believe that finding was justified in that there was nothing that indicated that the applicant should have the benefit of earlier parole eligibility than would be the case if the statutory proportion applied. There was a significant degree of double counting by reason of his Honour taking into account matters of mitigation to reduce the overall sentence and then using them again to find special circumstances without explaining why those matters should further reduce the minimum period that the respondent was required to serve in custody. See R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18] and Way at [178]. 
     
      
    71 This is not to suggest that matters relevant to the determination of the term of the sentence are not also relevant to the determination of the non-parole period but due regard must be had to the fact that the legislation requires the finding of special circumstances and that is, in my view, something more than the existence of factors that merely mitigate the sentence as a whole and have already been used for that purpose.  
     
      
    72 As was pointed out in Fidow a finding of special circumstances is now such a common event in sentencing that the currency has been devalued. After referring to statistical information which shows that 84.77 per cent of prisoner had a ratio of non-parole period to full term of 66.7 per cent or less, the Chief Justice stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        This research makes it necessary for this Court to state the obvious. Simply because there is present in a case a circumstance which is capable of constituting a “special circumstance” does not mean that a sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion. To repeat what was said in  
        Simpson 
         at [68], it is necessary that the circumstances be sufficiently special to justify a variation. 
        
       
       
      There was nothing in the present case that by itself or in combination was sufficiently special to require that the non-parole period be further reduced from that arising from the reduction of the term of the sentence by the matters mentioned by his Honour. 
       
      
    73 The respondent will have available to him sex offender programmes and it could safely be assumed that, unless he takes advantage of those courses and can persuade the Parole Board that he can safely be returned into the community, he will not be released to parole. If he does complete the programmes and his rehabilitation is advanced to the stage that he is released to parole, I find it difficult to believe that he would require supervision for a period of four years to ensure that his rehabilitation is confirmed. The statutory ratio would have resulted in a non-parole period of 8 years 3 months and a parole period of 2 years 9 months, a period that was more than adequate for the respondent’s rehabilitation. 
     
      
    74 In my opinion this was an instance of the all too frequent occurrence of a court finding special circumstances simply as a way of ameliorating the statutory presumption of the proper ratio between the minimum period of incarceration and the term of the sentence without any other reason to justify such a departure. That is in my view a significant error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion and a failure of a court to comply with the manifest will of Parliament. 
     
      
    75 In any event a non-parole period of 7 years is in my view grossly inadequate as representing the minimum period of punishment the respondent should serve upon whatever basis it is assessed. If I ask myself the question posed by two members of the High Court in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 32 at [22], “is the sentence manifestly wrong?”, the answer is a resounding, “Yes”. The Crown appeal should be allowed. 
     
      
    76 There are no discretionary matters that in my view would warrant the Court staying its hand. The delay in the Crown lodging the appeal is a relevant matter but has to be seen in context and, as I have already noted, I do not believe that uncertainty of the respondent as to his punishment has the same impact in this case as it might have in cases where the sentence the subject of the appeal is considerably less and where the resolution of the appeal has an almost immediate impact upon the respondent, either by a return to custody or the frustration of a release date which is relatively close at hand. The consequential effect upon the conditions of his custody by the existence of a Crown appeal and by a lengthening of the eligibility date for release to parole are unfortunate but insufficient to require or justify this Court in staying its hand having regard to the seriousness of the offending and the inadequacy of the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    77 It is customary where the Crown succeeds on an appeal for the Court to impose a sentence at the lower end of the range that was available to the sentencing judge. I am prepared to follow that practice notwithstanding some doubts as to whether it should be adopted as an inviolable rule for the exercise of this Court’s discretion following a successful Crown appeal. In the circumstances of this case, having regard to the history of the matter, it is appropriate to adopt that course in any event. The overall sentence takes into account the plea of guilty and the 25 per cent discount that his Honour determined was appropriate. 
     
      
    78 There are no special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory ratio as regard to the overall sentence term and the overall non-parole period. The parole period resulting form the statutory ratio is sufficient for the respondent’s needs by way of supervision and rehabilitation and I do not believe there is any other reason to reduce the non-parole period. I find special circumstances in respect of charge 3 in order to preserve the statutory ratio between the overall term and the non-parole period because that sentence is being made partially cumulative. 
     
      
    79 I am satisfied that, considered individually, none of the sentences imposed by Judge Sides are too high. The total sentence to be imposed on the respondent will be limited by the principle of totality. In this situation, as a matter of discretion, it is unnecessary to consider whether any of the head sentences should be increased. In light of my view that the appropriate effective sentence can be achieved by changes to the sentences imposed in respect of counts 3, 4 and 5, again as a matter of discretion, I find it unnecessary to interfere with the erroneous non-parole periods fixed in respect of counts 1 and 2. 
     
      
    80 In light of the 25 per cent discount allowed to the respondent for pleading guilty, the overall term of the sentence should be imprisonment for 14 years and the non-parole period should be 10 years and 6 months dating from 28 November 2000. The respondent will become eligible to be released to parole on 27 May 2011. 
     
      
    81 By reason of the Crown appeal being allowed, the respondent’s application for leave to appeal should be refused. 
     
      
    82 I propose the following orders:- 
     
      
       
        
       
      1. That the application for leave to appeal be refused. 
       
      2. That the Crown appeal be allowed. 
       
      3. That the sentences imposed in respect of counts 3, 4 and 5 be quashed. 
       
      4. In respect of charge 5 the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 5½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years both such periods to commence on 28 November 2002. The non-parole period will expire on 27 November 2006. 
       
      5. In respect of charge 4 the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4½ years both such periods to commence on 28 November 2003. The non-parole period will expire on 27 May 2008. 
       
      6. In respect of charge 3 the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6½ years both such periods to commence on 28 November 2004. The non-parole period will expire on 27 May 2011.

       R v CJP 
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
      1.  
       THE COURT: 
       After judgment was handed down in this matter it was brought to the Court's attention that the sentence as specified in paragraph 82 and the overall sentence as described in paragraph 80 are inconsistent. It was the Court's intention that the sentence should be as stated in paragraph 80. Therefore some corrections need to be made to the order in paragraph 82. The sixth order made should read: 
       
       
       6. In respect of charge 3 the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 1/2 years both such periods to commence on 28 November 2005. The non-parole period will expire on 27 May 2011.

     Judgment 
      
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: On Thursday 29 April the Court as presently constituted refused an order sought by the applicants to stay their trial currently listed to commence on Monday 3 May 2004 until the final determination of matters raised on appeal to which I will refer.  
     
      
    2 The application for stay was listed as a matter of urgency and nothing was put before this Court manifesting evidence given in the proceedings below (see s 5F(4) Criminal Appeal Act), however there were matters of common ground as well as the content of two interlocutory judgments of Whealy J which are the subject of appeal.  
     
      
    3 The applicants are to be tried on indictment presented by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions charging conspiracy with each other to defraud the Commissioner of Taxation. The detail of the indictment is not presently relevant. In the months of February, March and April pre-trial issues have been ventilated and determined by the presiding trial judge and empanelment of the jury is scheduled for 3 May 2004.  
     
      
    4 On 16 April 2004 application was made to Whealy J on behalf of the accused applicants to be supplied with documentation identifying the names, occupations and allocated identification numbers of the members of the jury panel. 16 April was a Friday and at that point jury empanelment was scheduled to commence on the following Monday 19 April. Following argument, the learned trial judge ruled that the Jury Act 1977 on its proper construction prevented the giving to the accused or their counsel the names and occupations of the members of the panel for the purpose of selecting a jury. His Honour’s ruling was given on Friday 16 April and his published reasons are before the Court.  
     
      
    5 On Monday 19 April 2004 shortly before the members of the jury panel were brought to court counsel for the accused informed his Honour that notice of the raising of a constitutional matter had been sent to the attorneys-general pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903. It suffices to note that some chose to present argument. Similar notices were sent in respect of the appeal now before this Court. As a short statement of the point sought to be raised, it was contended that the refusal to supply the information sought on the previous Friday would have the result that the trial would not comply with s 80 of the Commonwealth Constitution and, to any extent that the Jury Act 1977 might be relied upon to withhold information from the accused or their counsel, its provisions were unconstitutional in that the accused would not be being afforded a trial according to law as required by s 80.  
     
      
    6 On Wednesday 28 April 2004 Whealy J ruled against the applicants’ contention and his published reasons are also before the Court. Nevertheless on that day his Honour certified that the issues raised and dealt with in each of the judgments that I have mentioned were proper for determination on appeal by this Court. There is no need to pause to recite the content of the certificate. 
     
      
    7 Having regard to the imminence of jury empanelment and commencement of trial the question of whether a stay should be granted and, if so, for how long was segregated and heard on 29 April upon which day, as I stated at the outset, stay was refused. 
     
      
    8 The consequence of the grant of certificate by Whealy J is that no grant of leave is necessary and the matters sought to be argued are before the Court as of right. At some point the Court is obliged to receive argument and determine the issues. This discriminates the present situation from one in which a court considering an application for a stay makes an assessment as to whether a proposition sought to be advanced is reasonably arguable or not. In assessing whether stay should be ordered the issue of the certificate by the presiding judge weighs in favour of the application. Although as I have indicated, the judgments of the trial judge related separately to the construction of the Jury Act 1977 and then the matter of constitutional guarantee, counsel expressly stated that this application for stay related to the subject matter of the first of the two judgments.  
     
      
    9 Nevertheless, application for stay also involves consideration of matters pertinent to the balance of convenience and prejudice to parties. These must be contemplated in the context of the particular matter. 
     
      
    10 There have also been three months of interlocutory arguments before the trial judge. The length of trial is estimated to be three to four months. Citizens called as potential jurors need to be present in numbers which are multiples of twelve. By reason of the late raising of the issues now put forward on behalf of the applicants there has already been one occasion upon which selection of twelve jurors from a panel did not take place. 11 It is common in any case where there is a possibility that a trial which has been embarked upon is terminated for some reason such as jury discharge, or after verdict for reasons of law convictions are quashed and new trial ordered, or a purported trial is held to be nullified by some circumstance attaching to it, that legal costs can be said to have been wasted. In this instance, the potential is not determinative. 
     
      
    12 It is important for the administration of justice that trial should not be unduly delayed. It is common ground that it is several years since arrests took place. It is also common ground that a large part of the Crown case is evidenced by documentation and by the product of telephone intercepts. The latter will require expert evidence by way of translation as the Court was told that most, and perhaps all, of the relevant conversations were had in a language other than English.  
     
      
    13 Several discrete matters, for example the availability of anticipated witnesses, were mentioned by counsel. Ignoring the absence of evidence concerning these matters, they do not severally or collectively persuade me that if they were proved, a different conclusion should be reached. 
     
      
    14 Balancing all the matters that have been adumbrated in the argument before the Court, my conclusion was that this Court should not intervene to delay the scheduled commencement of trial. 
     
      
    15 SIMPSON J: On 29 April 2004 the applicants, who are accused of conspiracy to defraud the Commissioner of Taxation, sought a stay of their trial then listed to commence on Monday 3 May 2004. This Court refused the application. These are my reasons for concurring in the decision to refuse the application for a stay. 
     
      
    16 The circumstances are stated in the judgment of Grove J. I need only recapitulate them briefly. The applicants are charged with conspiracy to defraud. Interlocutory applications have occupied several months of hearing time. The trial itself is expected to be a lengthy one. One consequence of that circumstance is that it has been necessary to summon a much larger than usual jury panel, in order to ensure that an adequate number of individuals able to devote the necessary time are available for selection. 
     
      
    17 Among the many interlocutory issues raised and determined by the trial judge was an application on behalf of the applicants for certain personal information about each member of the jury panel summoned. This was said to raise constitutional issues within the meaning of s78B of the Judiciary Act 1903. The judgment given by the trial judge was adverse to the applicants. They signified their wish to appeal against that decision and sought, pursuant s5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, a certificate. The trial judge so certified that the judgment was a proper one for determination on appeal. The applicants, therefore, appeal to this Court as of right against the judgment. The appeal had not, as of 29 April 2004, been allocated a hearing date. 
     
      
    18 On this basis the applicants sought a stay of the trial pending the determination of their appeal. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion the determination of the stay application involved the balancing of, essentially, two competing considerations. One consideration is of convenience. The other involves some assessment of the merit, or prospects of success, of the argument raised on behalf of the applicants. 
     
      
    20 The questions involving convenience are far ranging and diverse. If it be assumed that the trial were to commence, and the applicants’ appeal ultimately be successful, then a trial which had proceeded for a period of time which could not, at the time this Court ruled, be known, would inevitably have to be aborted pending the provision to the applicants of the information they seek. Inconvenience would be caused to the twelve individuals selected as the jury whose time would have been wasted; to witnesses who had given evidence and would be required to do so again; to the applicants themselves and their legal representatives; and to the court. There would be obvious costs implications. The consequence of the applicants’ succeeding in their appeal could have a considerable impact upon all of these people. 
     
      
    21 On the other hand, if the trial were delayed, and the applicants’ appeal were eventually unsuccessful, inconvenience would have been caused to a large jury panel, to witnesses, to the prosecution, and to the court, which has allocated a large block of hearing time to the trial. 
     
      
    22 The costs and inconvenience issues were, to my mind, finely balanced. If the only issue were the relative weight of inconvenience in each of these scenarios, I would have leant to the view that a stay might be granted. That is because, it seems to me, the greater inconvenience (and expense) would arise in the former scenario. In my view, determination of the application hinged largely upon the best assessment I could make of the likely outcome of the appeal. This Court heard little argument and was, obviously, not in a position to reach a final judgment on that question. However, doing the best I could on the limited material available, it seemed to me that the applicants’ prospects were not such as to warrant the inconvenience and cost of delaying a trial fixed for hearing only one (working) day after the application was made to this Court. 
     
      
    23 Accordingly, I joined in the order made by the court. 
     
      
    24 HOWIE J: I agree with the reasons of Grove J and I join in the order of the Court refusing the stay.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BRYSON JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: On 12 April 2002 Raymond John Ensby (""the applicant"") was arrested at Casino. He was charged with having used an offensive weapon with intent to commit the indictable offence of assault (contrary to s33B(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900). The maximum penalty for that offence is 12 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 On 25 November 2002 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court. He pleaded guilty. On 12 June 2003 he was sentenced by Acting Judge Ducker. He asked that the sentencing Judge take account of a further offence on a Form 1, namely, possessing a shortened firearm (not being a pistol) without authority (contrary to the Firearms Act 1996). His Honour imposed a sentence of five years imprisonment, with a non parole period of three years and nine months. The sentence was backdated (to 2 March 2003) to take account of 102 days in custody before Mr Ensby was given bail. 
     
      
    5 The applicant asserts that the learned sentencing Judge was in error in three respects: 
     
      
    · First, the sentence was excessive. 
     
      
    · Secondly, the sentencing Judge failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant's subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, the sentencing Judge should have found special circumstances. 
     
      
    6 Before considering each ground, I should briefly state the circumstances in which the offence was committed. 
     
      
       
      The offence. 
       
      
    7 The matter proceeded before his Honour upon the basis of an agreed statement of facts, and a number of documents from the Crown brief. The documents included statements from eye witnesses, and a transcript of an interview with Mr Ensby by the police. The statement of the victim, Ms Alison Battis, however, did not form part of the tender. Whilst acknowledging his guilt, Mr Ensby disputed Ms Battis' account of the circumstances giving rise to his offending behaviour. Mr Ensby did not give evidence on sentence. 
     
      
    8 Mr Ensby and Ms Battis lived together in Casino for approximately eighteen months. Ms Battis had a six year old son. At the end of 2001 the relationship soured. Ms Battis claimed that she had been assaulted by Mr Ensby on a number of occasions. She said that she lived in fear of him. 
     
      
    9 On 12 January 2002 Ms Battis attended the Casino Police Station. She described the assaults she said had been perpetrated against her, the last being in November 2001. She made it plain that she did not wish to prefer charges. Rather, she sought an Apprehended Violence Order against Mr Ensby. 
     
      
    10 The order was duly made and served. In March 2002 Ms Battis arranged for her son to be cared for by her estranged husband, Mr Leon Battis. She then left the Casino area.  
     
      
    11 On 10 April 2002, the day before her son's birthday, Ms Battis returned to Casino. She apparently had left a pair of leather boots at the home of Mr Ensby. Upon her return she spoke to him on the phone. According to Mr Luke Callaghan, who shared a house with the applicant, Mr Ensby thereafter made a number of telephone calls in which he appeared agitated and abusive. 
     
      
    12 Late on the evening of 12 April 2002, Ms Battis, incautiously, went to the premises in which Mr Ensby lived. She was accompanied by a young man, whom she knew from a childcare facility which her son attended. Her friend quickly excused himself and left once it became apparent that there may be unpleasantness. 
     
      
    13 Mr Ensby repeatedly asked Ms Battis to come to his bedroom. He said he wished to speak to her in private. Each time she refused. According to Luke Callaghan, Mr Ensby took hold of a baton with a piece of frayed nylon rope at the end, which had been hanging on the doorway. He lifted the baton over his head and threatened Ms Battis with it. 
     
      
    14 Mr Ensby asserted that, at some point, Ms Battis got hold of the baton and repeatedly struck him with it. He said he responded by producing a shortened .22 calibre rifle. The butt and the barrel of the rifle had been sawn off. A tennis ball had been taped to the shortened barrel to form a crude silencer. Ms Battis claimed that Mr Ensby waved the weapon around, pointing it at her. Mr Callaghan, however, did not see the firearm produced. 
     
      
    15 Ms Battis decided to leave the house. She worked her way towards the front door. Mr Ensby moved to block her path. She nonetheless managed to escape. She ran from the premises with Mr Ensby pursuing her. 
     
      
    16 Ms Battis was a woman aged 30 years. She was described as ""slight"". Mr Ensby, on the other hand, was described by the sentencing Judge in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The defendant is a big powerful looking man albeit now in his late fifties."" 
        
       
      
    17 Ms Battis ran along McDougal Street, Casino, towards the cemetery. She was carrying the wooden baton, which she said that she had picked up for her own protection. The applicant caught up with her. He pushed the firearm into her neck. Such was her fear that she began to urinate and dry retch. She was ordered to walk into the cemetery, which she refused. She was again prodded with the firearm and again urinated. 
     
      
    18 Ms Battis asserted that, whilst prodding her in this way, Mr Ensby threatened to kill her. As they walked towards a roundabout, she saw several men on the verandah of a nearby home. She called for help. As it happened, a police officer, Inspector Driver, was approaching the intersection in a marked police vehicle, coming from the south. He heard the screams of Ms Battis. He described what he saw in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I drove up to the intersection of Centre and Johnson Streets Casino and I made a U-turn at the roundabout. I then drove south along Centre Street and as I approached the couple I saw that the male had something in his right hand and was pointing it at the left side of the female's stomach. This object was about 30 cm long protruding from his right hand. I stopped the police car and as I did I saw the female drop to the ground cowering down on her knees. She lifted her arms up and covered her head with her arms, and her torso was bending over. The male had his left hand on the female's right shoulder I saw the male point what I considered may have been a firearm at the left side of her head, however it appeared too short for a rifle and too long for a pistol. The object was angled down to her temple. I was about to alight from the police vehicle and the male turned around. He still had this object pointed at the left side of the female's head and then he stepped to the left then to the right."" 
        
       
      
    19 The victim believed that she was going to die. She closed her eyes. She again urinated in her pants. 
     
      
    20 Inspector Driver approached Mr Ensby, who endeavoured to escape. However, his path was blocked. Bravely, the Inspector took hold of the barrel of the firearm and removed it from his grasp. Mr Ensby was arrested. He told the officer that the weapon was not loaded, and indeed it was not. Mr Ensby was searched. He had two cartridges capable of being fired by the rifle in the pocket of his jeans. 
     
      
    21 Ms Battis, meanwhile, had rushed into a nearby house. She passed a couple on their front verandah, and closed the door to their home behind her. The occupant of the home went to investigate. He described what he saw in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""13. I got up and went inside to see how she was. She was just laying down in the hallway, curled up on her side. She was crying. When I opened the door she jumped like I was going to hurt her. I said, 'I'm not going to hurt you' and sat down and asked her if she was alright. I couldn't understand what she was saying, she was talking quick and changing subject halfway through or mumbling. Then she asked for a drink of water so I got her a drink of water. At that point she said quite clearly to me: 'He put a shotgun to my head.' I talked to her for a couple of minutes."" 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: The sentence was excessive. 
       
      
    22 The sentence imposed was a term of imprisonment of five years. Since a discount of 20 percent was made for the plea of guilty, his Honour's starting point was a term of six years and three months. That, according to the applicant, was too high. Although the applicant acknowledged that the offence was serious, s33B(1) simply contemplated putting someone in fear. Ms Battis had suffered no physical harm. The section comprehended much worse conduct than that of the applicant, as his Honour recognised in the following remarks: (ROS 6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Assault per se carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, whereas the present charge carries a maximum of twelve. Although the section also covers more serious indictable offences, in the present instance the use of the offensive weapon to instil terror in the victim is the most serious aspect of the offence. Although the physical hurt suffered by the victim was not great, the other aspects of the offence are very cruel. The offence, although perhaps unpremeditated must be treated as a serious one."" 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour added that he would place the offence ""below the middle of the range, at about point four on a scale of 10"". 
     
      
    24 The applicant submitted, therefore, that taking account of the objective criminality, and the subjective circumstances of Mr Ensby (the subject of ground 2), the sentence was too severe. The sentencing discretion had miscarried. 
     
      
    25 The Crown, in its submissions, drew attention to a number of matters. First, his Honour described the terror felt by the victim in these words: (ROS 5/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""One can only imagine the terror that she felt when told, after being forced to her knees, that she was going to be killed. The conduct of the offender was both cowardly and reprehensible. He terrorised the victim and deprived her of every vestige of self respect. It seems likely that this episode will linger long in her memory."" 
        
       
      
    26 Secondly, the offence was one in which deterrence, both general and personal, was important, as his Honour recognised. One year earlier, on 18 April 2001, the Local Court at Casino had sentenced Mr Ensby for stalking and intimidating a woman with intent to cause fear of physical and mental harm. That offence occurred on 15 February 2001. The victim was another woman with whom Mr Ensby had had a relationship. Her fear stemmed, in part, from Mr Ensby's access to firearms, which he kept concealed at his home. Mr Ensby was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, the sentence being suspended upon his entering into a bond (s12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). It was a term of the bond that he should not come within ten kilometres of Kyogle (where the woman lived), except to drive through without stopping. Mr Ensby was also obliged to submit to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, including counselling in respect of anger and violence. 
     
      
    27 Although the bond had expired by the time Mr Ensby was charged with the present offence, it had not long expired. It was plainly a relevant and disquieting feature of Mr Ensby's background. His Honour said this: (ROS 7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Offences of this nature require that general deterrence be given full weight. There is also reason for personal deterrence, bearing in mind that the offender did have two cartridges in his pocket, which were capable of being fired by the weapon he had, had Inspector Driver not come on the scene. Also the matters at the Lismore Local Court on 16 February 2001 (sic), of intimidation and stalking involved a threat to use a firearm."" 
        
       
      
    28 Thirdly, his Honour was also obliged to take into account the possession of the shortened firearm, the subject of the offence included on the Form 1. The firearm was the same shortened rifle used by Mr Ensby when committing the assault in count 1. 
     
      
    29 I will shortly deal with the second ground of appeal, which concerns the subjective features of the applicant's case. Taking account of those features, I believe the objective gravity of Mr Ensby's conduct was such that the sentence could not be described as being outside the range of sound sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    30 I would dismiss the first ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The subjective case. 
       
      
    31 It was said on behalf of the applicant that his Honour did not make proper allowance for ""the offender's health, antecedents and prospects of rehabilitation"". 
     
      
    32 Dealing with his criminal record, his Honour remarked that it was ""not of assistance to him"". Mr Ensby had a number of convictions, in a number of states, mainly for offences of dishonesty, including larceny and housebreaking. He had, on many occasions, been sentenced to terms of imprisonment, each relatively short. 
     
      
    33 Two things can be said favourable to the applicant in respect of his record. First, there were significant gaps, which demonstrated that he was capable of law abiding behaviour. That, no doubt, was relevant to his prospects of rehabilitation. Secondly, the offences for which he had been convicted, at least before 2001, were not crimes of violence. 
     
      
    34 His Honour was conscious of both matters. In his remarks he referred to each (ROS 7, 8 and 9). They were matters to be weighed alongside the disturbing and recent behaviour of Mr Ensby, namely, the conviction in April 2001 and the offence which is the subject of this appeal. 
     
      
    35 His Honour was provided with reports from a psychologist. They revealed a history of significant alcohol abuse in earlier times and, more recently, drug abuse, including at the time of the offence. Mr Ensby disclosed to the psychologist that, for some time before the offence, he had been using amphetamines intravenously. He asserted however that, since going to prison, he had ceased taking drugs. The psychologist said he had no way of verifying that claim but, assuming it was right, it was a ""positive prognostic sign"", as were the gaps in Mr Ensby's criminal history. On the other hand there were the following negative features: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The negative prognostic indicators are that his criminal history has spanned such a large time period, that even in his 50's he had a significant drug problem. Also his limited insight and tendency to minimise his own contribution to his circumstances is of concern."" 
        
       
      
    36 I see no basis for the suggestion that his Honour undervalued Mr Ensby's prospects of rehabilitation or wrongly characterised his criminal history. 
     
      
    37 On 3 February 2003, whilst awaiting sentence, Mr Ensby was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident in which the other driver was killed. Mr Ensby was not at fault. He also suffered injuries and was admitted to hospital. His injuries were described by Dr Banks, his treating doctor, in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... fracture of left 8th rib (and possible old multiple rib fractures), right shoulder soft tissue injury, fracture of right acetabulum (hip)."" 
        
       
      
    38 Mr Ensby complained of right shoulder and neck pain. His Honour said this, referring to the report of the physiotherapist (Ex 3): 
     
      
       
        
        ""It seems that he has been left (report of physiotherapist Mr Haywood, Exhibit 3) with limitation of movement of the cervical spine on rotation and extension and left lateral flexion. He also has reduced flexion and abduction of the internal rotation to the sacrum. The suggestion is that he will need further physiotherapy for some time. That is something that the Corrective Services should bear in mind."" 
        
       
      
    39 The applicant complains that such remarks undervalued his disabilities and the difficulties they will create for him in gaol. The relevant principle was stated by King CJ in R v Smith (1987) 27 A Crim R 315 in these terms: (at 317) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. Ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. It is the responsibility of the Correctional Services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners. Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender's health."" 
        
       
      
    40 Here, in relative terms, the disabilities were not substantial. It is not obvious that they would make imprisonment a greater burden to Mr Ensby. His Honour was plainly conscious of them. In my view no error is demonstrated in not having specifically characterised them as something calling for mitigation. 
     
      
    41 I would reject ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: Special circumstances. 
       
      
    42 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that there were two features in Mr Ensby's background that made it appropriate for his Honour to find special circumstances. The first was his history of drug taking and the second his inability to control his anger in the context of domestic relationships. Both, according to submissions made on behalf of the applicant, suggested that Mr Ensby would benefit from an extended period of conditional release on parole (Phelan v The Queen (1993) 66 A Crim R 446, per Hunt CJ at CL at 449-50). 
     
      
    43 The Crown in response drew attention to R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172, where the Chief Justice emphasised the discretionary nature of a finding of special circumstances. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""18. In  
        R v Simpson 
         (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, this Court identified the wide range of factors capable of constituting special circumstances. Nevertheless, on each occasion in which s44(2) of the Act is invoked, it is necessary for the sentencing judge to make a decision, as noted in  
        Simpson 
          
        at [68] that the circumstances are sufficiently special for the statutory proportion to be reduced. Section 44(2) requires the 'decision' to be that the statutory proportion of one-third be 'less'."" 
        
       
      
    44 It is not enough that there is material before the Judge which was capable of justifying a finding of special circumstances. The applicant must demonstrate error in the exercise of the discretion not to vary the ratio. As to that issue, in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 the Court made the following observation: (at 73) 
     
      
       
        
        ""As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive."" 
        
       
      
    45 In R v Fidow (supra para 41) itself, the Court declined to intervene. Spigelman CJ, having referred to a recent paper ""Sentencing Trends and Issues"" (March 2004), said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""22. This research makes it necessary for this Court to state the obvious. Simply because there is present in a case a circumstance which is capable of constituting a 'special circumstance' does not mean that a sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion. To repeat what was said in  
        Simpson 
         at [68], it is necessary that the circumstances be sufficiently special to justify a variation."" 
        
       
      
    46 His Honour was, of course, an experienced Judge. He specifically addressed the issue of special circumstances in the course of argument (T6-7) and declined to vary the statutory proportion. Whilst he did not elaborate upon the view he formed, it was, I believe, a view open to him. No error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
       
      Order. 
       
      
    47 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. That leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      2. That the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
      
    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Bergin J. 2 SPERLING J: I agree with Bergin J. 
     
      
    3 BERGIN J: This is a Crown appeal against the sentence imposed on the respondent on 26 September 2003 by the sentencing judge, Maguire DCJ, on 2 charges of unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm contrary to the provisions of Section 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, in respect of which the respondent pleaded guilty with a further 7 offences on a Form 1 taken into account. The maximum penalty prescribed for offences under section 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 is imprisonment for 14 years. The respondent was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 ½ years and the balance of the terms of 2 years.  
     
      
    4 The appeal was heard on 10 March 2004 when judgment was reserved. Subsequently the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered judgment in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J, dealing with standard non-parole periods. The parties were invited to make submissions consequent upon that judgment and that process concluded on 17 June 2004.  
     
      
     
     
      
      The statutory regime for sentencing 
      
    5 The offences were committed on 28 February 2003 and the sentencing process was therefore governed by the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act) as they were amended by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 effective from 1 February 2003. Section 3A of the Act provides that the purposes of sentencing are: to ensure adequate punishment; to prevent crime by deterrence of the offender and others; to protect the community; to promote rehabilitation of offenders; to make offenders accountable; to denounce the offender’s conduct; and to recognise harm done to a victim and the community.  
     
      
    6 The manner in which a sentence is imposed is governed by s 44 of the Act and requires the Court to first set a non-parole period for the sentence and then set the balance of the term of the sentence. The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence unless the Court decides that there are “special circumstances” for it being more than one-third. If that decision is made the Court must “make a record” of its reasons (s. 44(2)).  
     
      
    7 The offences are subject to a standard non-parole period of 3 years, such period representing the non-parole period “for an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness” for the offence: (s 54A & Table in Div. 1A). The Act provides that the “court is to set” the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the Court determines that there are reasons for setting a longer or shorter non-parole period (s 54B). The “reasons” for which the Court may depart from the requirement to set the standard non-parole period are “only those referred to in s 21A” of the Act (s 54B(3)). In R v Way the Court held that the standard non-parole periods in the Table in Division 1A are intended for a middle-range case where the offender was convicted “after trial” (at [68]-[69]).  
     
      
    8 Section 21A does not, in terms, refer to “reasons”. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        Aggravating, mitigating and other factors in sentencing 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        21A  
        (1)  
        General  
         In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters:  
         
          
          (a) the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court, 
          (b) the mitigating factors referred to in subsection (3) that are relevant and known to the court, 
          (c) any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. 
          
         
        The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law. 
         
        
       
       
        
        (2)  
        Aggravating factors 
         The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:  
         
          
          ( 
          a) the victim was a police officer, emergency services worker, correctional officer, judicial officer, health worker, teacher, community worker, or other public official, exercising public or community functions and the offence arose because of the victim’s occupation, 
          (b) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence, 
          (c) the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon, 
          
         
         
         (d) the offender has a record of previous convictions, 
         (e) the offence was committed in company, 
         (f) the offence involved gratuitous cruelty, 
          
           
          (g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial, 
          (h) the offence was motivated by hatred for or prejudice against a group of people to which the offender believed the victim belonged (such as people of a particular religion, racial or ethnic origin, language, sexual orientation or age, or having a particular disability), 
          (i) the offence was committed without regard for public safety, 
          (j) the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence or alleged offence, 
          (k) the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, 
          (l) the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bank teller or service station attendant), 
          (m) the offence involved multiple victims or a series of criminal acts, 
          (n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
          
         
        
        
        The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
        
       
       
       (3)  
       Mitigating factors 
        The mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:  
        
         
          
          (a) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial, 
          (b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, 
          
         
         
         (c) the offender was provoked by the victim, 
         (d) the offender was acting under duress, 
          
           
          (e) the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions, 
          (f) the offender was a person of good character, 
          
          
         (g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend, 
          
           
          (h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender’s age or otherwise, 
          (i) the offender has shown remorse for the offence by making reparation for any injury, loss or damage or in any other manner, 
          (j) the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender’s age or any disability, 
          (k) a plea of guilty by the offender (as provided by section 22), 
          (l) the degree of pre-trial disclosure by the defence (as provided by section 22A), 
          (m) assistance by the offender to law enforcement authorities (as provided by section 23). 
          
         
        
       (4) The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so. 
       (5) The fact that any such aggravating or mitigating factor is relevant and known to the court does not require the court to increase or reduce the sentence for the offence. 
        
          
        
       
      
    9 Where an offender pleads guilty, the Court must take the fact of the plea and the timing of the plea into account when passing sentence and in doing so “may” impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed (s. 22).  
     
      
    10 This statutory regime suggests that, for a conviction after trial for an offence against s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 in the middle range of objective seriousness for which the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment, without adjustment to the standard non-parole period for reasons referred to in s 21A and without adjustment to the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term based on special circumstances, the appropriate sentence is 4 years imprisonment – being the standard non-parole period of 3 years and the balance of the term not exceeding one-third of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    11 In sentencing the offender for the principal offence the Court may take into account further offences, with which the offender has been charged but not convicted, that are included on a list (Form 1) filed by the prosecutor and which the offender has indicated he wants the Court to take into account. (s. 32 & 33).  
     
      
      The Sentencing proceedings 
      
    12 The facts establishing these offences were outlined in a Statement of Facts dated 28 February 2003, an edited version of which was included in the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentencing as follows (ROS 1-2): 
     
      
       
        
        At 10:10pm on Thursday 27 February 2003 the accused entered the Pacific International Hotel located on Chapel Road, Bankstown. At the time he was in the company of Mohamed Alkhair who paid for a room at the hotel with a fraudulent credit card. Neither male had luggage. Both males then entered the bar of the hotel where they purchased a jug of Coke and they proceeded to room 236 which had been allocated to them. Room 236 had been cleaned one hour prior to their arrival.  
        
       
       
        
        At about 10:20pm, Amanda Havron and Miriam Alkalhal entered the hotel and staff reporting the matter to police via telephone observed them to walk to room 236 where the accused and Alkhair were waiting for them.  
        
       
       
        
        The police were called and in company with staff of the hotel, they approached the door of the relevant room. One of them knocked on the door and said, “Reception”. One of the female occupants of the room opened the door and police entered the room. The prisoner was observed seated in a single lounge chair on the far side of the room. The other man was lying on the two-seater lounge. Police instructed both males to stand and move towards the walls of the room. They complied. 
         
        They searched Alkhair and then moved towards the prisoner. He was wearing a baggy black jumper and a pair of light coloured cargo pants. As police started to run their hands over the accused’s lower back to search him, he lowered his right hand from the wall towards the front waist line of his pants. He was instructed to put his hand back on the wall and he complied.  
        
       
       
        
        Police continued to search his lower back and he again lowered his hand towards the front of his waist line. The searching police officer reached around to the front of the prisoner’s waist line and grabbed hold of his hand and simultaneously felt a hard metallic object. The prisoner attempted to pull the object away from the police officer who countered by taking possession of the object and removing it from the prisoner’s pants. 
        
       
       
        
        As the object was removed, it was identified as a black pistol. Police seized the pistol and continued the search of the prisoner’s person. During the search, they located a second pistol in his rear left trouser pocket. The pistol was a metallic silver smaller calibre pistol. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner was interviewed electronically during which he admitted being at the Pacific International but declined to answer any questions in relation to possession of the firearms or any other matter. Checks on one of the pistols disclosed that it was reported stolen previously and the prisoner does not hold licences authorising him to possess firearms or ammunition. 
        
       
      
    13 It was not contested before the sentencing judge that the magazines of both guns were loaded with ammunition but that neither had a bullet in the chamber.  
     
      
    14 The history of the matter before the sentencing judge is that on 29 August 2003 the appellant tendered its evidence, the respondent, although he did not give evidence, relied upon a number of references and final submissions were made. A pre-sentence report, based on a telephone interview with the respondent, was in evidence and included the following, at page 2: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Mouloudi was somewhat reluctant to discuss the offences. He acknowledged having the firearms and added that in retrospect this was a “stupid” thing to do. He stated that he would rather not elaborate. 
        
       
      
    15 This report also referred to the fact that the respondent had been assessed as “requiring a high level of intervention, given his firearms charges and his reluctance to discuss them in any detail” and that “supervision would focus on monitoring Mr Maloudi’s choice of associates and lifestyle generally” (p.3). 
     
      
    16 The appellant’s counsel informed the sentencing judge that the maximum penalty relevant to these offences was 14 years imprisonment. The respondent’s counsel referred to the new regime of penalties on two occasions referring to the fact that the legislature had increased the penalties recently and that, in those circumstances, the sentencing statistics would not provide assistance. The appellant agreed that those statistics were of marginal relevance because the offences occurred after 1 February 2003 “so that the new standard non-parole period provisions are enlivened”.  
     
      
    17 The respondent’s counsel submitted to the sentencing judge that the respondent had not been found in possession of the firearms “for a hostile purpose” and that the possession of the weapons was as a result of vanity and stupidity. In respect of the police officers’ evidence in relation to the respondent twice reaching towards his waistband, it was submitted that it was merely “that instinct of self-survival which prompted him to try and hide them and somehow escape – hoping they would escape detection”. When it was drawn to the respondent’s counsel’s attention that the police evidence was uncontradicted, counsel informed the court that the respondent did not want to give evidence but that he had instructed his counsel that he was “only trying to pull his jumper over to conceal and hopefully escape detection” (tr. 2; 29/08/03). 
     
      
    18 The Director of the Wangee Road Childcare Centre in Greenacre provided a reference in which the opinion was expressed that the respondent was found to be thoroughly honest, reliable and responsible in every aspect. Reference was also made to the respondent’s regular voluntary work at the childcare centre, including maintenance, gardening and repairs. The Pre-Sentence Report referred to the respondent having stated that, “he helped out a sister in a child care centre where she works as a teacher”. There was no evidence before the sentencing judge as to whether this was the child-care centre at which the sister taught. 19 There was also a reference from Ms Nadia Bernoussi, with whose family the respondent and his family had lived for three months on their arrival in Australia, apparently from Morocco, on 17 July 1988. Ms Bernoussi regards the respondent as a younger brother and described him as “a quiet young man” who is “well mannered and extremely friendly” and “respects people a lot always willing to help his family”. There is also reference to the lack of a “male mentor” because the respondent’s father left the family when the respondent was very young and that there appeared to be a “sad emptiness about that part of his life”.  
     
      
    20 A further reference from a friend, Fatima Bloul, referred to the respondent as a very kind, nice and helpful person. Mrs Lamia Sy, who had known the respondent and his family for fifteen years and had employed him as a gardener and painter stated that she found him to be “loyal, honest, considerate, trustworthy and very caring” with her two children. A further reference from Zahra Ennebt, whose house the respondent had painted, referred to him as “conscientious and capable of using his initiative when necessary”.  
     
      
    21 Finally, a reference from Ahmed Essafi, the executive chef from Fez Café referred to the respondent’s employment as a casual cook from 18 March 1998 and that in the six months prior to 18 March 2003, the date of the reference, the respondent had “become a strong and dependable employee”. There is no mention of knowledge of the subject offences. That reference concludes: “Naturally we wish Adam well in all his future endeavours, he is honest and trustworthy and I am sure he will continue to make his mark within this industry”. 
     
      
    22 In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge said he found it “difficult to identify the person described by the authors with the person appearing before the Court” (ROS 5.5). 
     
      
      Respondent’s criminal history 
      
    23 At the time of sentence on 26 September 2003, the respondent’s criminal history was as follows: 
     
      
       
       Charge date 
       Charge 
       Conviction date 
       Sentence 
       
       
       21/08/2000 
       Possess prohibited drug 
       11/09/2000 
       $200 fine plus court costs 
       
       
       27/01/2002 
       Possess prohibited drug 
       29/05/2002 
       $300 fine 
       
       
       01/07/2002 
       Malicious wounding 
       11/02/2003 
       8 months periodic detention commencing 28/02/03; npp 6 months. 
       
       
        
       Possess unauthorised firearm – not prohibited 
        
       8 months periodic detention; npp 6 months 
       
       
        
       Possess prohibited drug 
        
       S9 bond; 2 years – supervision – to report within 7 days 
       
       
        
       Unlawfully possess prescribed restricted substance 
        
       S9 bond; 2 years-supervision – to report within 7 days 
       
       
        
       Possess/use prohibited weapon without permit 
        
       S9 bond; 2 years – supervision – to report within 7 days 
       
       
        
       Goods suspected stolen in/on premises 
        
       S9 bond; 2 years – supervision – to report within 7 days 
       
       
       19/01/2003 
       Supply prohibited drug 
       22/05/2003 
       6 months imprisonment commencing 28/02/03 
       
      
    24 The respondent committed the offences the subject of this appeal on the day that he was due to commence the first period of periodic detention imposed on 11 February 2003. As a result of his inability to commence that detention the Parole Board revoked the periodic detention sentence and converted it to a sentence of four months and ten days imprisonment with a non-parole period of two months and ten days. 
     
      
    25 The sentencing judge referred to the circumstances of the malicious wounding in his remarks on sentence as follows (ROS 3): 
     
      
       
        
        It is common ground that that malicious wounding involved the discharge of a firearm under the control of the prisoner, which discharge resulted in the wounding of the prisoner’s own nephew. His record also discloses a conviction for unlawfully possessing a prescribed restricted substance and possessing a prohibited weapon. These charges are related to the malicious wounding charge.  
        
       
      
    26 The appellant emphasised that at the time of the commission of the subject offences, the respondent was on four separate Section 9 Bonds of two years duration that had been imposed seventeen days before the commission of the subject offences. Additionally, at the time of the commission of the subject offences the respondent was on bail in relation to the count of supply a prohibited drug in respect of which he had been charged on 19 January 2003. 
     
      
      The Form 1 
      
    27 There were 7 additional offences on a Form 1. They were 2 offences of possess a firearm, not registered in the state of NSW; 2 offences of possess ammunition without holding a licence or permit; 2 offences of not taking all reasonable precautions to ensure that a firearm was kept safely; and 1 offence of having a pistol in his custody reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained.  
     
      
    28 The sentencing judge referred to matters on the Form 1 and stated that they “have been taken into account” but did not specify the “principal offence” in respect of which they were taken into account (ROS 1). 
     
      
      The Sentence 
      
    29 The sentence was imposed on 26 September 2003. The Remarks on Sentence included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        The maximum penalties attracted by the crimes to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty are imprisonment for five years and the law provides a standard non-parole period of three years.  
        
       
        
      (ROS 1) 
       
       
        
        He has served time in prison previously and has been in custody pending his hearing. He has been given opportunities in the past and does not appear to have taken advantage of them. I have taken into account his plea of guilty, but only to a limited degree in view of the strength of the case against him.  
        
       
       
        
        It is very clear to me that there is a great deal of disquiet in the community at the proliferation of illegal weapons in circulation. One sees in this Court too many instances of the use of such weapons. I see the need to deter this offender and to deter others from the commission of crimes such as this. This is not a case where the offender had the weapons in a show case at home where he could admire them. He had them concealed on his person. I accept that when apprehended, he endeavoured to remove one of the weapons from his trousers, using his right hand. 
        
       
       
        
        His own counsel has asked for an extended period of parole. My own view is that extended supervision upon release may very well serve to assist in his rehabilitation. His record, although a bad one, is not one of long standing, nor could it be having regard to his relatively young age. But I do think there is a real prospect of rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        There are in my view special circumstances that justify the displacement of the usual ratio between head sentence and non-parole period and I think that those same circumstances justify, in this case, the imposition of a non-parole period shorter than the standard. I am mindful of the provisions of s3A and of s21(A) (sic) as amended of the 
         Criminal (sic) (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        and have taken them into account.  
        
       
      
     Stand up. 
     
      
       
        
        I sentence you to a minimum term of two and a half years imprisonment. I sentence you to a further term of two years imprisonment. The sentence and non-parole period are to commence on 27 February 2003. The term of the sentence expires on 26 August 2007. The term of the non-parole period expired (sic) on 26 August 2005. 
        
       
        
      (ROS 5-6) 
      
    30 The sentencing judge reduced the standard non-parole period from 3 years to 21/2 years and fixed the balance of the term at 2 years. Although it is not clear from the remarks on sentence it is apparent that the sentencing judge intended to impose the sentence on each of the principal offences and intended that they be served concurrently. It was common ground that the reference to the maximum available penalty of 5 years was incorrect. The maximum available penalty in relation to these charges under the Firearms Act 1996 is 14 years. 
     
      
      Material Error of law 
      
    31 The appellant appeals pursuant to Section 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the basis that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was manifestly inadequate. The appellant submitted that the intervention of this Court is justified because of the material error of law made by the sentencing judge in applying the wrong maximum penalty. It is submitted that was fundamental error and caused the proceedings to miscarry in a number of respects, resulting ultimately in the imposition of a sentence disproportionate to the gravity of the offences.32 Prior to the delivery of R v Way the appellant submitted that the sentencing judge was required to determine whether the standard non-parole period should be set which necessitated consideration of whether the offence was “an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” (s 54A). It was also submitted that such determination could only have been made by reference to the correct maximum penalty and that the belief that the maximum penalty was 5 years unduly restrained the sentencing judge’s discretion in that regard. 
     
      
    33 It was submitted that by reason of this error alone, the court should intervene and re-sentence the respondent. 
     
      
    34 The respondent submitted that the sentencing judge did not make a material error of law in the application of the wrong maximum penalty and that the reference to the maximum penalty of 5 years was a “slip of the tongue”. It was submitted that a careful consideration of his remarks on sentencing in the context of the sentencing process makes it clear that the sentencing judge was aware of the new regime of penalties that were applicable and the provision of a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The respondent submitted that on at least six occasions during the sentencing hearing references were made to the new statutory provisions relating to the standard non-parole period and that reference was also made to the maximum penalty of 14 years. It has to be remembered that those references were made on 29 August 2003 and the respondent was not sentenced until 26 September 2003.  
     
      
    35 It was submitted that from the context of the remarks on sentence, it can be concluded that the sentencing judge did not regard the conduct amounting to the commission of these offences as the worst type of cases: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478; Ibbs v R (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451. On that basis it was submitted that if the sentencing judge had really thought that the maximum penalty was 5 years it would be very unlikely that he would have given a 41/2 year sentence for these offences. It was submitted that his Honour dealt with the matter on the basis of the correct maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and the court should not intervene. 
     
      
    36 An analysis of the sentencing judge’s remarks and the sentencing proceedings leads me to comfortably conclude that the sentencing judge regarded these offences as very serious indeed. He referred to the fact that “both” guns were loaded (ROS 2.9) and rejected as “ridiculous” the proposition that the guns were acquired for purely “decorative reasons” (ROS 4.8). He also found that there was no overt evidence of contrition (ROS 4). He also referred to the respondent’s criminal history and the fact that he committed the offences on the “very day” that he was to commence his periodic detention (ROS 3). Although referred to earlier in this judgment it is appropriate to reiterate that the remarks on sentence included the following (ROS 5): 
     
      
       
        
        It is very clear to me that there is a great deal of disquiet in the community at the proliferation of illegal weapons in circulation. One sees in this Court too many instances of the use of such weapons. I see the need to deter this offender and to deter others from the commission of crimes such as this. This is not a case where the offender had the weapons in a show case at home where he could admire them. He had them concealed on his person. I accept that when apprehended, he endeavoured to remove one of the weapons from his trousers, using his right hand. 
        
       
      
    37 These are significant findings against the respondent who had been suggesting, through submissions, that the action was an instinctive reaction to hide the gun rather than, as found, a positive action to remove the gun. The context of these findings leads also to the conclusion that the respondent was not attempting to remove the gun to assist the police in taking it from him. It is clear that the sentencing judge concluded that this action was hostile.  
     
      
    38 These findings demonstrate that the sentencing judge viewed these offences as extremely serious. He took the respondent’s plea of guilty into account “only to a limited degree” (at 5.4). In my view it does not present as a realistic possibility that with these findings the sentencing judge could then have imposed a sentence of only four and a half years for offences of such seriousness had he not felt himself constrained by a maximum penalty of 5 years. The error as to the maximum penalty was a material error of law warranting intervention by this Court and the re-sentencing of the respondent. 
     
      
    39 It should be said that the sentencing judge should have had assistance from the appellant, at least, so that the error exposed very early in the remarks on sentence was corrected. There was opportunity either to interrupt the remarks at that time or at the time the sentencing judge requested the respondent to stand up for the purpose of the imposition of the sentence. Alternatively, application could have been made after the imposition of the sentence, pursuant to s 43(2) of the Act to reopen the sentencing proceedings so that a sentence according to the law, that is, having regard to the correct maximum sentence, could have been imposed.  
     
      
      Re-sentence 
      
    40 The appellant submitted that this is a matter which should be categorised as being towards the upper range of the scale of seriousness for this offence particularly having regard to the following factors: multiplicity of offences; both pistols were loaded; both pistols were secreted on the respondent; one pistol was a stolen pistol; there was a high degree of risk to members of the public and a real danger posed to police by reason of the respondent’s possession of the loaded and unsecured weapons; the respondent had just one month and eight days previously been admitted to conditional liberty by way of bail in respect of the supply drug offence; the respondent had just seventeen days earlier been sentenced to periodic detention in respect of offences of malicious wounding and possess unauthorised firearm; the respondent was on conditional liberty and the subject of four bonds; and a further seven offences were required to be taken into account. 
     
      
    41 The appellant submitted that it is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the “moral culpability” of the offender or shows his “dangerous propensity” or a need to “impose condign punishment” to deter him: Veen v R (No 2) at 477  42 The respondent submitted that the various firearms offences overlapped to some extent and therefore the appellant’s submissions exaggerate the degree of seriousness of the respondent’s conduct. It is also submitted that there is no evidence that the respondent knew that the pistol was stolen. It was conceded that the potential risk and community concern is unable to be doubted or ignored, however, it was submitted that there was no evidence that the respondent had an intention of using the pistols and that his actions when searched were designed to better secrete the first weapon found by the police officer and that after it was found the respondent remained passive.43 It was submitted that the respondent’s criminal record reveals minor drug possession offences and that the serious criminality occurred over a short period of time during which admittedly the respondent was involved in “serious criminal activity”. However it was submitted that there are a number of mitigating factors that apply to the respondent: (i) there was no evidence that injury, emotional harm, loss or damage was caused by the respondent and none was intended (s 21A(3)(a)); (ii) the offence was not part of organised criminal activity (s 21A(3)(b); (iii) the respondent is unlikely to re-offend (s 21A(3)(g); (iv) the respondent has good prospects of rehabilitation, as found by the sentencing judge (s 21A(3)(h); and (v) there was a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity although the evidence was overwhelming (s 21A(3)(k)). 
     
      
    44 These mitigating factors are not all available. There was no evidence of injury but it is not clear that “none was intended”. Indeed the finding that the sentencing judge made in respect of the respondent reaching for the pistol means that not much weight should be given to this factor. There was no evidence that the offences were part of organised criminal activity. Certainly the trial judge found that the respondent had a “real prospect of rehabilitation”. The basis for that finding is not at all clear particularly in the light of the fact that the respondent declined to discuss the offences with the probation and parole officer. However that observation should be tempered by the fact that the interview was over the telephone which, it is reasonable to conclude, would hardly be conducive to candid exploration of criminal conduct. In any event, it appears that the sentencing judge based his finding on the relative youth of the respondent who was 20 years of age at the time of the offences and 21 years of age at the time the sentence was imposed. 
     
      
    45 The submission that the respondent “is unlikely to re-offend” is not supported by the evidence. The availability of a real prospect of rehabilitation does not mean that the factor of “unlikely to re-offend” is available. Until that prospect is a reality a conclusion is unable to be drawn in relation to the likelihood or otherwise of this respondent re-offending. Unfortunately his criminal history casts real doubt about that matter but the sentencing judge has given the respondent the real prospect by reason of his age. The intention was clearly to give the respondent as much time under supervision as possible. 46 The respondent’s counsel submitted that the respondent had, through him, expressed his remorse for his actions and that there are good reasons why the Court can accept that he is remorseful. On this aspect the sentencing judge’s remarks that he saw “no overt evidence of contrition on the part of this young man” (ROS 4.8) remain apt. It was also submitted that, although the circumstances of the previous convictions are very serious, they do not support the view that the respondent has a dangerous propensity to intentionally use firearms to injure people. It was submitted that the respondent suffered a great deal of anguish as a result of the circumstances giving rise to his conviction for the malicious wounding of his nephew which, it was submitted, occurred in a very unsettled period of his life. There is no evidence that supports these submissions other than the suffering of these and the earlier convictions. It was conceded that his arrest for firearms offences on 28 February 2003 so soon after that conviction is a seriously aggravating factor.47 The appellant submitted that the sentences for the present offences should commence from 27 August 2003, the date of the expiration of the sentence on the supply prohibited drug conviction, an offence for which he was on bail at the time of the commission of these offences, so as to mark the gravity of the respondent’s conduct in abusing his conditional liberty. It was submitted that cumulation of sentence is almost an invariable rule in circumstances where an offender takes advantage of his conditional liberty to commit further crimes. In support of this submission the appellant relied upon what Badgery-Parker J said in R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 128: 
     
      
       
        
        Several decisions of this Court have emphasised the need for significant sentences to be imposed on an offender who takes advantage of his liberty whilst on bail to commit further crimes. In such circumstances the almost invariable rule is that the sentence to be imposed for the later offence should be made cumulative upon the offence in respect of which the prisoner was on bail. 
        
       
      
    48 The appellant submitted that there was and is no good reason in the light of the flagrant breach of bail and the breaches of the opportunities afforded by the Court, to do anything other than apply the rule and order that the sentences for the subject offences be served consecutively upon the sentences for supply prohibited drug and the malicious wounding and firearm offences. 
     
      
    49 The respondent’s counsel submitted that the instant case should be considered an exception to the “almost invariable rule” because of the subjective factors that are relevant to the respondent’s case including his good prospects for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    50 There are other reasons for excluding this case from the almost invariable rule. The first is that from the evidence before this Court such a submission was not put to the sentencing judge. The second reason is that the appellant should have assisted the sentencing judge when the error was clear early in remarks on sentence or before he imposed sentence or after the sentence was imposed pursuant to s 43(2) of the Act. I am not satisfied that the sentence should commence from 27 August 2003 rather than 28 February 2003. 51 The sentencing judge determined that there were circumstances that justified the imposition of a non-parole period shorter than the standard non-parole period. However it was submitted that the determination was infected by the fundamental error made in relation to the maximum penalty and that it should have been determined that a non-parole period longer than the standard should have been set because the offences were above the middle range of objective seriousness and there were no factors which justified a non-parole period of less than three years.52 The appellant submitted that it is evident from the terms of Section 7 (1) of the Firearms Act 1996 that it was intended to cover a range of criminal conduct. It was submitted that the section makes the fundamental distinction between the possession and use of a firearm that is a prohibited firearm or pistol and any other firearm. It was also submitted that the conduct indulged in by the respondent exhibited a degree of seriousness well above that of a person who had possession in private premises of a firearm, not loaded and properly secured, and in circumstances where licences might have been issued and lapsed or where licences had been sought and had not been granted and the like. 
     
      
    53 It was also submitted that the criminal conduct of the respondent was of a high order and was aggravated by the matters referred to earlier. It was submitted that this included the circumstances of the respondent’s arrest set out in Constable Paff’s statement which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        Mouloudi placed his right hand back on the wall and I continued to search around the lower back. At this point, he dropped his right arm again and it appeared to go to his waist band. I instinctively thought this was strange and I quickly placed my left hand around to where his hand was. I grabbed hold of his hand and immediately felt a hard metal object which he was holding. I grabbed hold of the object, squashing his hand and he began to pull the object away from me, and I began to pull back and after a bit of struggling I managed to get the object from his grip, and turned slightly to my left. I looked down my hand and saw a large black metallic handgun similar to the police issue Glock. 
        
       
      
    54 The appellant submitted that having regard to the applicable maximum penalty the proper assessment of the respondent’s conduct is that it was well above the middle range of seriousness for the offence. In those circumstances it is submitted that the non-parole period should have been correspondingly above the standard non-parole period of three years. 
     
      
    55 The respondent’s submissions included a concession that the offences were alarming from a public safety point of view but that the respondent had no intention and did not, in fact, threaten anybody. It was submitted that his possession of the firearms can be attributed to his foolishness and immaturity rather than a desire to commit acts which threaten the safety of the public. However counsel responsibly put the submission that one appreciates that the potential for things to go wrong is a serious matter in itself. As to the aggravation of the offences by reason of them being committed whilst the respondent was on conditional liberty, it was suggested that the respondent was extremely foolish and immature at that time. 
     
      
    56 In conclusion, it was submitted that despite the objective seriousness of the offences and the duty of the Court to the community, this is a matter where the prospect of rehabilitating the offender should mitigate the penalty to be imposed. It was submitted that the public interest in the rehabilitation of offenders, especially young offenders, should be given considerable weight and that a sentence commensurate with that imposed by the sentencing judge is appropriate. I agree that the public interest in the rehabilitation of young offenders should be given considerable weight, and the sentencing judge’s finding that this respondent has a real prospect of rehabilitation by reason of his age should be recognised in the re-sentencing of the respondent.57 The origin of the nature of the sentence to be imposed by this Court as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal is found in what was said by Street CJ in R v Holder & Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 256 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        … the sentence passed on a successful Crown appeal does not always represent the full measure of sentence which might have been passed upon the convicted person at first instance. 
        
       
      
    58 In the same case Priestley JA said at 269: 
     
      
       
        
        The double jeopardy aspect in Crown appeals against sentence appears in another situation also: the court will in some cases where it is persuaded that the original sentence was inadequate, impose an increased sentence which is nevertheless less severe than that which the court thinks should have been imposed at first instance.  
        
       
      
    59 This approach has developed further so that a sentence imposed as a result of a successful Crown appeal will not only be generally less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing judge but also will generally be towards the lower end of the appropriate range of sentence: Dinsdale v R (2000) 202 CLR 321. It seems to me that the concept of the “appropriate range” of sentence has been adjusted by the introduction of the standard non-parole period for certain offences, combined with the requirement to fix the non-parole period first. In this regard in Regina v Way the Court said at paragraph 53: 
     
      
       
        
        There is nothing in Division 1A to suggest that the statutory maximum ceases to provide a benchmark, or a reference point, in sentencing, so far as it is a manifestation of legislative intention as to the seriousness of the offence. The focus is, however, likely to shift more towards the standard non-parole periods where they apply, since they may be taken to express a legislative intention as to the minimum periods of actual imprisonment, which are appropriate for the relevant offences. 
        
       
      
    60 The consequence is that when the Court of Criminal Appeal is imposing a sentence as a result of a successful Crown appeal, the focus is more on the recognition that the standard non-parole period is a reflection of the middle range of objective seriousness for the offence where the offender was convicted after trial (Way at par 68) and then, on considering the conduct against that reflection in coming to what is an appropriate sentence, applying the principle of double jeopardy.  
     
      
    61 It is clear that the sentencing judge regarded these offences as extremely serious. Although he did not differentiate between the two offences it seems to me that the offence in which the respondent reached for the prohibited firearm during arrest is more serious than the offence in which he remained passive on arrest. In Regina v Penisini; Regina v Lagi; Regina v John Taufahema [2003] NSWSC 892 Wood CJ at CL in considering offences under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 said: 
     
      
       
        
        96. I would add, in relation to the firearm offence, that reference to the Judicial Commission statistics would tend to suggest that insufficient consideration has been given to the degree of seriousness with which the legislature regards such offences, as indicated by the maximum available sentence of imprisonment for 14 years. In part, that may be due to the fact that the population of recorded cases, where non parole periods or fixed terms were imposed, is very small (only 7 in number), or to the fact that some of those cases may have predated the increase in the maximum sentence. In those circumstances, and bearing in mind the serious aggravation involved where the offender who uses or possesses an unlicensed handgun was on parole, I regard it as necessary to impose a sentence above the range which the statistics would otherwise disclose. 
        
       
       
        
        97. In this regard, the observations of Howie J in  
        R v Shankley  
        (above), citing  
        R v Oliver  
        (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 and  
        R v H  
        (1980) 3 A Crim R 53, are apposite; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “a consideration of the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence is fundamental to a determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed … It represents the public’s view of the seriousness of the crime.” (At para 19) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        98. That was the case where, upon a crown appeal, a sentence for a firearm offence, by an offender who had been subject to a bond for similar offences, was increased, after allowance for double jeopardy, from a term of imprisonment for four years with a non parole period of 3 years to one of imprisonment for six years with an non parole period of two years and three months, the latter being significantly reduced because of the accumulation of the sentence upon that imposed for another offence, so as to restore the statutory ratio between the total effective sentence and the total non parole period. 
        
       
       
        
        99. The decision underlines, in a clear and obvious way, the proper approach to be taken to firearm offences in the case of offenders such as the three persons now before the Court who were on conditional liberty, particularly where they had prior convictions involving the use or possession of firearms, and it provides a much more certain guide than anything which might emerge from the sentencing statistics. 
        
       
      
    62 The first step in re-sentencing the respondent is the fixing of a non-parole period. Both offences were in my view far more serious than an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Although the standard non-parole period does not apply in this case because the respondent was convicted after a plea rather than after a trial, the appellant submitted that it is convenient to ask the question posed in R v Way at par [117] namely “are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period”? It seems to me that in sentencing after a plea the Court may have regard to the standard non-parole period applicable after conviction but it must be remembered that the discretion in fixing a non-parole period after a plea is unfettered. 63 As the sentencing judge found, both offences involved loaded firearms and such firearms were not acquired for “purely decorative reasons”. An aggravating factor to be taken into account on the first offence is the sentencing judge’s finding that the respondent reached for the weapon, amounting to a threatened use of a weapon (s 21A(2)(c)). Other aggravating factors relevant to both offences are that they were committed without regard for public safety (s 21A(2)(i)); and were committed while the respondent was on conditional liberty (s 21A(2)(j)). Additionally the respondent has a record of previous convictions (s21A(2)(d)). The fact that those convictions included the malicious wounding of his nephew resulting from the use of an unauthorised firearm just six months prior to these offences is a seriously aggravating factor, as is the factor that he was on bonds when he committed these offences.64 The mitigating factors to be taken into account are; that the respondent has a real prospect of rehabilitation by reason of his age (recognising the sentencing judge’s finding); that the respondent pleaded guilty to the offences and did so before the magistrate thus requiring the utilitarian value to be assessed in the range of 10 to 25 per cent discount on sentence: R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; that there was no substantial injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence (but lessened by the finding in respect of reaching for the pistol); and that there was no evidence that the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    65 The aggravating factors of these offences far outweigh the mitigating factors. To be in possession of two loaded prohibited firearms, in respect of one of which there was a threatened use, whilst on bail and within two weeks of being sentenced to eight months periodic detention for maliciously wounding his nephew as a result of the use of an unauthorised firearm, and on the day that he was to commence his detention is conduct of a gravely serious kind. 66 The matters in the Form 1 will be taken into account on the second offence. These matters are taken into account in sentencing the respondent in respect of the second offence with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the offence. In this regard greater weight will be given to the need for deterrence of the respondent and the community’s entitlement to exact retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has been imposed, whilst paying regard to the maximum penalty and the principle of totality: Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 per Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL, Grove J, Sully and James JJ agreed) at [42]-[43]. 67 The first offence is more serious than the second and the matters on the Form 1 are taken into account in sentencing the respondent on the second offence. The special circumstances as found by the sentencing judge of the real prospect of rehabilitation by reason of the respondent’s age is the basis upon which the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term will be adjusted. Applying the principle of double jeopardy and after giving a discount of 20% for the pleas of guilty before the magistrate, an appropriate sentence for each offence is a non-parole period of 4 years with the balance of the term fixed at 2 years. The sentences should be served concurrently and should date from 28 February 2003. 
     
      
    68 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal is upheld. 
       
       
      2. The sentences imposed by Maguire DCJ on 26 September 2003 are quashed. 
       
       
      3. On each offence and taking the matters on the Form 1 into account on the second offence, the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and the balance of the term is set at 2 years. The sentences are to date from 28 February 2003 and are to be served concurrently.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    3 HISLOP J: The applicant was convicted by a District Court jury of the offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence (larceny), in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he knew that there was a person or persons present within the said dwelling at that time, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for such offence is twenty years imprisonment. Woods ADCJ sentenced the applicant to four years imprisonment to date from 13 November 2002 with a non-parole period of three years. 
     
      
    5 His Honour also dealt with the applicant for two related offences, under provisions which are now found in Part 3 Division 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, namely resisting police (s 546C of the Crimes Act 1900) and assault police (s 60(1) of the Crimes Act 1900). In respect of these offences his Honour imposed concurrent sentences of six months. 
     
      
    6 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 7 The facts, as found by his Honour, were: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…in the early hours of the morning of 13 November 2002 the (applicant) did break into the residence of Ms Jacqueline Cooper at 103 Arthur Street, Wellington, and did take certain property of Ms Cooper and did place it ready to remove from the house and he did this whilst Ms Cooper and her young son were asleep in the house. What happened was that Ms Cooper awoke to find the (applicant) asleep on the floor of the bedroom and she was able to contact police in time for them to attend at the residence and apprehend him before he got away from the house with the property that he had removed from the drawers and from her bag although she did have a traumatic twenty minutes on the phone calling 000 whilst he awoke and rummaged around the house.” 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour observed as to the objective seriousness of the offence: 
     
      
       
        
        “This was a break and enter of a dwelling house whilst the occupier was asleep. This is regarded as one of the most serious of offences and there can be no excuse or reason for such an intrusion into a place where people expect to be safe from harm and expect to be able to sleep peacefully and the community expects a strong deterrent punishment for any person who so deliberately attacks their security and puts people in fear and trepidation.”  
        
       
      
    9 The applicant relies, in his written submissions, upon three grounds of appeal, namely, (a) “The sentencing Judge had insufficient regard to the applicant’s subjective case and the principles enunciated in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58; (b) the sentencing Judge erred in failing to have regard to the applicant’s protective custody in determining the length of the sentence to be imposed and in determining whether there were special circumstances; and (c) in light of the applicant’s subjective case the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.” 
     
      
      Ground One  
       
      
    10 The applicant is an aboriginal man, born on 15 November 1961. He was thus 40 years of age at the time of the offences. He had an extensive criminal record since 1979 (the Crown suggested it consisted of 106 convictions). The convictions were for a variety of offences, including crimes of violence, stealing, larceny, break and enter, malicious damage, breaches of recognisance and drug offences. 
     
      
    11 The applicant had served several terms of imprisonment and at various times had received bonds. Notwithstanding this, his criminal activity continued unabated. Indeed the subject offence was committed whilst the applicant was on parole, following a term of imprisonment of 12 months for break and enter.  
     
      
    12 The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. A psychiatrist’s report was tendered, as was a Probation and Parole pre-sentence report.  
     
      
    13 The pre-sentence report stated that the applicant’s response to supervision and guidance by the Probation and Parole service had generally been superficial and to no avail. The applicant, despite being advised in past years to attend for counselling, had not complied and despite a history of stated good intentions regarding resolving his drug problems when in custody, he had failed to seriously address that issue when in the community. It was concluded, “there remains a likelihood of his continuing to maintain his current lifestyle should he not accept professional intervention”.  
     
      
    14 The principal submissions for the applicant on the first ground were based upon the principles in R v Fernando, this notwithstanding there had been no reliance upon those principles by experienced counsel at the sentencing hearing.  
     
      
    15 In Fernando’s case, it was held: 
     
      
       
        
        “The same sentencing principles are to be applied in every case irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group but that does not mean that the sentencing Court should ignore those facts which exist only be reason of the offender’s membership of such a group.” 
        
       
      
    16 It was submitted the applicant had had a disadvantaged childhood by reason of his aboriginality. However, the history contained in the psychiatrist’s report was that the applicant had a fairly good childhood, was close to his mother, never had any learning or disciplinary problems at school and completed year ten. It was not suggested on behalf of the applicant that the history, as recorded by the psychiatrist, was inaccurate. In the absence of any evidence by the applicant, his Honour was entitled to prefer the history obtained by the psychiatrist to that contained in the pre-sentence report which had stated the applicant was raised in a dysfunctional family environment, though it confirmed he completed schooling to year ten and stated he then completed three years of a carpentry apprenticeship. 
     
      
    17 The psychiatrist’s report contained a history obtained from the applicant that “he used to be a heavy drinker, many years ago. He described himself nowadays as an occasional drinker”. Alcohol was not a factor in this case. 
     
      
    18 The applicant did have a drug problem. The psychiatrist recorded a long-standing history of active poly-substance abuse; that prior to being taken into custody the applicant had been smoking cannabis and injecting heroin and amphetamines every day, and as much as he could afford. There was no evidence that such a problem existed only because of the applicant’s aboriginality. The self-administering of drugs is more likely to aggravate than mitigate - R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 307 at 327, particularly where the offender is aware of the effect of the drugs upon him, as was the case here. 
     
      
    19 The applicant suffered from a chronic ear infection with associated hearing deficit. It may be accepted hearing deficiencies caused by unattended ear infections is endemic among Australian aborigines (R v Russell (1995) 84 A Crim R 386 at 393). The psychiatrist recorded a history that the applicant had been abusing sleeping pills for many years in order to cope with his chronic ear infection, and that he was very upset finding himself back in gaol just because of the sleeping pills again. Every time he took the pills, he would not know what he was doing. The applicant was thus well aware of the effect of the sleeping pills. Although the taking of such pills may have contributed to the bizarre or extraordinary conduct of the applicant in sleeping on the victim’s floor, it does not make the applicant’s serious criminal conduct any the less liable to be punished for what it is – R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183 per Howie J at [41]. 20 In my opinion, the applicant’s subjective case is not advanced in reliance upon Fernando’s case and the applicant’s aboriginality. 
     
      
    21 In any event, it is not every case of deprivation and disadvantage suffered by an offender of aboriginal race or ancestry that calls for the special approach adopted in Fernando (see R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 102 per Howie J at [61]) and the mitigating effect of being an aboriginal person loses much of its force where the offender has committed similar serious offences in the past (see R v Drew [2000] NSWCCA 384 per Newman J at [21]).  
     
      
    22 Other subjective features were relied upon in the written submissions. It was submitted his Honour erred in concluding, “there does not appear to have been any remorse shown by the applicant for the distress that must have been caused to the victim”. The evidence in support of that submission is a comment in the pre-sentence report that the applicant “acknowledged the frightful experience he placed on the victim”. In my opinion, this comment falls well short of an expression of remorse, and, in any event, can have little value coming, as it does, only after the applicant had been convicted after a fully contested trial. There was no other evidence of remorse. His Honour had the opportunity of observing the applicant give evidence at the trial. He was entitled to conclude there did not appear to have been any remorse shown by the applicant. 
     
      
    23 The written submissions also relied upon the fact that the applicant’s mother, to whom he was devoted, had passed away whilst he was in custody. This is an unfortunate and sad event, but not such as provides a basis for mitigation of penalty. 
     
      
    24 In my opinion, his Honour was correct to conclude there were no mitigating factors which would entitle the applicant to any leniency. Indeed the applicant’s record was characteristic of a continuing attitude of ignoring the law, which would have justified a more severe penalty – Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. In my opinion, the first ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
       
      Ground Two 
      
    25 It was common ground the applicant had been assaulted whilst in gaol and had been in protective custody for the period of his remand. The Crown acknowledged that the applicant would have to be in a more difficult type of custody. However there was no express evidence as to the nature of the protective custody or that it was likely to continue. 
     
      
    26 This Court has held that it is relevant to the consideration of the length of the term of imprisonment and to the question of whether special circumstances exist to justify departure from the statutory proportion between the sentence and the non-parole period that a sentence of imprisonment is likely to be served in conditions of protection – R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 148 at 151. The rationale is that such custody may be more onerous than that of prisoners housed in the general prison population. However, there are many kinds of protective custody and evidence as to the likely conditions of custody is important if the Court is to make an informed assessment of the extent to which the offender’s custody will be more onerous than that of prisoners housed in the general prison population – R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207. The onus of establishing matters in mitigation lies upon the applicant – R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
     
      
    27 Accordingly the fact that an offender may be likely to serve his sentence in protection will not necessarily result in a shorter head sentence. The weight such factor will have will also depend on the objective seriousness of the offence for which the sentence is passed and the extent to which other factors such as general and specific deterrence must be reflected in the non-parole period – R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299 per Howie J at [19] and [20]; R v Mostyn [2004] NSWCCA 97 per Howie J at [179] – [181]. 
     
      
    28 That a sentencing Judge may not have expressly referred to the circumstance in his or her remarks on sentence should not necessarily give rise to an inference that he or she has failed to take the circumstance into account – R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 per James J at [44]. 
     
      
    29 In the present case, whilst it is unfortunate his Honour did not expressly refer to the fact that the applicant was and may continue in protective custody, it does appear from his judgment as a whole that he considered the matter as of little or no weight having regard to the applicant’s record, the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general and specific deterrence. The material before his Honour, in my opinion, did not require the reduction of the head sentence or the finding of special circumstances.  
     
      
       
      Ground Three 
       
      
    30 The findings by the sentencing Judge and his conclusions as to penalty were well open to him on the evidence. The sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive and a lesser sentence was not warranted in law. Indeed it was accepted by counsel for the applicant that this ground relied upon the matters raised by grounds one and two, and must fail if those grounds were unsuccessful. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    31 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment  
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Howie J and Newman AJ in draft form and I agree with their Honours and the orders which are proposed. 2 HOWIE J: In this matter the facts and circumstances giving rise to the appeal are set out in the judgment of Newman AJ. He would allow the appeal on grounds 1 and 4. I agree with the orders he proposes. However I wish to make some brief comments on these grounds and the reasons given by his Honour for allowing the appeal. I also believe it appropriate to consider aspects of one other ground of appeal. 
     
      
    3 There can be no doubt that Judge Ducker’s interjection in defence counsel’s address, as set out in the judgment of Newman AJ, was unwarranted. The simple fact that his Honour intervened in the way that he did would not carry the ground of appeal. The significance of the interjection is in the timing of it and the subject matter to which it was directed. 
     
      
    4 There is nothing wrong with a submission to the jury that, if there is a reasonable or real possibility that the Crown case had not been made out, they should acquit the accused. That submission is merely a different formulation of the standard direction that the jury cannot convict the accused unless they are satisfied of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. If a real or reasonable possibility exists that, for whatever reason, the Crown’s contention in support of the charge is not true, it follows that the jury cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has made its case. 
     
      
    5 With respect, it does not seem to me to matter whether the Crown case is one of identification of the accused as the offender or not. It is not uncommon for self-defence to be put to a jury in terms of whether there is any reasonable possibility that the accused acted in self-defence. That is because the jury might have difficulty in understanding that before the Crown has proved its case, it has to disprove either a positive assertion by the accused or an inference arising on the evidence that the accused was acting in self-defence. It is also not uncommon, in my experience, where the accused has given an exculpatory account in evidence or in a recorded interview, for the jury to be told that, if there is a reasonable possibility that the account given by the accused is true, they should acquit. 
     
      
    6 The only possible danger with putting the standard of proof in this way is that it might suggest that the accused has an onus of raising the possible scenario that is inconsistent with the Crown case. But I do not believe that a jury would have the slightest difficulty understanding that it is not for the accused to prove that such a possibility exists, especially where it is made clear that the accused has to prove nothing by way of defence to the charge. But in any event, if defence counsel sees some forensic advantage in putting the defence in that way, there is no reason why the trial judge should interfere and suggest that what is being said is erroneous or inappropriate. 
     
      
    7 If the difficulty that his Honour had with defence counsel’s submission was that he did not use the words “real” or “reasonable” before the word “possibility”, then such a fault simply did not warrant the trial judge’s intervention. I understand that the proper formulation of the standard of proof stresses that the jury is concerned with a “reasonable doubt” or a “real possibility” but I believe that the concern that a jury will act upon a possible scenario that is unreasonable or fanciful is without foundation. In any event, as Newman AJ notes, the absence of the word “reasonable” or “real” from counsel’s submission could easily have been addressed in the summing up. 
     
      
    8 The second part of this ground is to the effect that the trial judge failed properly to direct the jury as to the standard of proof and the possibility that Walsh or some other person stabbed the victim. The argument is that his Honour ought to have directed the jury in the way that defence counsel had sought to do in his address: that the jury should acquit the accused if there was a reasonable possibility that the victim was stabbed by some other person. 
     
      
    9 I do not believe that there is any general requirement for a trial judge to use this formulation as part of the directions on the onus and standard of proof whatever be the nature of the Crown case or the evidence tending to exculpate the accused. In my view Mule v The Queen [2002] WASCA 101 and Pollitt (1990) 51 A Crim R 227 should not be considered as authorities requiring some special form of direction to be given in a case of “negative identification”, that is where there is evidence to suggest that the accused was not the person who committed the crime. Provided that the judge makes it clear to the jury that, if they accept the evidence exculpating the accused or could not exclude it beyond reasonable doubt, they should acquit, it does not matter how that proposition is expressed. In a case where there was evidence of “negative identification” I can understand that many judges would, at some stage in the summing up, use the formulation commended in those decisions and that defence counsel attempted to use in the present case. But that is a matter of personal choice. There are enough restrictions and requirements placed on trial judges as it is without creating another. 
     
      
    10 I agree with Newman AJ that in the present case the trial miscarried. But that is not because there would have been any defect in the directions in the summing up on the onus and standard of proof, absent the interjection by the trial judge in defence counsel’s address. In my view, the defect in the present case is that, having interjected in the way that he did, his Honour could well have left the jury with the understanding that the fundamental issue in the trial could not be determined in the way that counsel had expressed it; that is that they should acquit the appellant if there was a possibility that the victim was stabbed by Walsh or some other person. If that understanding was left with the jury, there is a very real risk that they were at least confused as to how they should resolve the issue before them. The summing up would not have adequately dispelled any confusion or misunderstanding arising from his Honour’s interjection occurring as it did at the very end of defence counsel’s address. 
     
      
    11 I agree with Newman AJ that success on this ground is enough to dispose of the appeal and that the verdict must be quashed. I also agree that ground 4 has been made out for the reasons given by Newman AJ and I have nothing to add in that regard. However I do wish to say something about Ground 2. 
     
      
    12 This ground complains of directions given by his Honour during the summing up in relation to the witnesses generally and three witnesses in particular: Geoffrey MacDonald; Dylan Walsh; and the appellant. In my view the complaints in respect to the evidence of Walsh and the appellant are not made out and there is no need to refer to that part of the summing up dealing with these witnesses as the appeal is being allowed in any event. However, the warnings given in respect of MacDonald were unwarranted and, in my opinion, resulted in an unfairness to the defence case. 
     
      
    13 Geoffrey MacDonald was a witness called in the defence case who gave evidence of an admission to the stabbing of the victim allegedly made by Dylan Walsh while the two were in prison together. It must be acknowledged at the outset that there was a substantial problem with his credibility arising from his evidence to how it was that he came to give evidence at the trial. However, it is unnecessary to give any detail about his account in order to understand the ground of appeal and the complaint made about what his Honour said to the jury about his evidence. 
     
      
    14 The nub of the criticism of the summing up in this regard is that his Honour treated MacDonald as if he were a prison informer in respect of whom a warning was required under s 165(1)(e) of the Evidence Act, yet he was giving evidence for the defence. On at least two occasions his Honour directed the jury that his evidence needed to be scrutinised very carefully. He advised the jury that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Sometimes people in custody do make confessions to other inmates on the belief that they will not be passed on. Sometimes it has been shown that false claims have been made of prisoners that a fellow prisoner has made a confession of some kind. 
        
       
       
      At one stage his Honour went so far as to inform the jury that giving evidence of a confession by an inmate “could help the person who gave that evidence to an earlier parole or possibly a better time in gaol”. His Honour later withdrew that observation, but the fact that it was said indicates the flavour of the comments made in relation to the evidence of MacDonald. In any event even when redirecting the jury his Honour told the jury that “he was a witness of a type whose evidence really needs to be scrutinised”. Unfortunately none of these comments were apposite to a witness who was not a prison informer as that class of witness was regarded in  
      Pollitt v The Queen 
       (1992) 174 CLR 558 or in s 165: he was not giving evidence on behalf of the prosecution. 
       
      
    15 In my view, it will rarely be appropriate for a jury to be warned to scrutinise the evidence of a defence witness with care regardless of how unreliable the witness might be. Warnings and cautions in relation to the potential unreliability of witnesses usually arise because the court has some knowledge of particular aspects of the evidence which might undermine its reliability and which might not be readily apparent to a juror. See generally R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301; R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321 at [125]. The matter or matters that call for a warning under s 165 will rarely be applicable to a witness who is not giving evidence implicating an accused person of the offence for which the accused stands trial. 
     
      
    16 So, for example, where a witness falls within the class of witness mentioned in s 165(1)(d), often referred to as an accomplice, but is giving evidence for the defence exculpating the accused, no warning under the section would be appropriate at least so far as the evidence is in favour of the accused; R v Baker [2001] NSWCCA 151 applying R v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744. This is because the aspect of the witness’s status that gives rise to the possibility of unreliability is no longer relevant: the potential of the witness to falsely implicate the accused in order to diminish his own culpability ceases to exist. 
     
      
    17 In Fowler, above, the Court was at pains to point out that whether a warning is required under s 165 and the content of the warning if one is necessary will depend upon the issues raised in the trial. Judges should avoid routinely giving warnings under the section without a request being made by counsel or without at least raising the matter with counsel so that the issue can be addressed by the parties and the content of the warning settled. The Crown made no request for a warning about the evidence of MacDonald and his Honour did not forecast that he intended to give the jury a warning about his evidence. Once the warning is given, it is difficult to effectively withdraw it where it proves inappropriate. 
     
      
    18 There are some classes or types of evidence that are potentially unreliable no matter whether they exculpate or inculpate an accused. Identification evidence is the most obvious. In R v Rose (2002) 55 NSWLR 701 it was held by a majority of this Court that identification evidence is so notoriously unreliable that some warning should be given where such evidence plays any part in the trial even if it tends to exculpate the accused. That was a case where evidence was given of the identification of the deceased at a time and place inconsistent with the Crown case against the accused for her murder. In the joint judgment of Wood CJ at CL and myself at [297], we held that in such a case some warning should be given about the unreliability of identification in general, but that “there would be good reason for the trial judge to temper the warning and information given to the jury in respect of that evidence”. 
     
      
    19 I can see nothing in the evidence of MacDonald that called for any warning of the type envisaged by s 165. It was open for his Honour to make comment upon the aspects of the evidence of MacDonald that might indicate he was an unreliable witness other than that he was giving evidence of a gaol confession allegedly made by a fellow prisoner. But the Crown’s cross-examination of the witness was to suggest that Dylan Walsh’s confession was a result of him “big noting himself”. It was never put to the witness that he was untruthful or unreliable but rather that the confession by Walsh might have been unreliable. That being so there was no occasion for the trial judge to make any comment about the reliability of MacDonald let alone to give a warning about it. The trial miscarried as a result of the unnecessary warnings and comments made about MacDonald’s evidence. 
     
      
    20 NEWMAN AJ: The Appellant appeals against his conviction for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent upon Shane Anthony Jones at Lismore on 8 September 2002. He relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1(a) The learned trial judges intervention in defences counsel’s address. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) His Honour’s failure thereafter properly to direct the jury in relation to the standard of proof and the possibility that one Dylan Walsh or another person committed the stabbing. 
        
       
       
        
        2(a) The trial judge erred in his directions as to the evidence of Geoffrey McDonald. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The trial judge erred in his directions as to the evidence of Dylan Walsh. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The trial judge erred in his directions as to the evidence of the Appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The trial judge erred in his directions as to the evidence of the witnesses. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The trial judge erred in directing the jury that the accused may have attempted to set up a false alibi and failed to withdraw those directions adequately or at all. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The trial miscarried as a result of the trial judges intervention in the evidence of the witness Austin Irvine; and 
        
       
       
        
        5. A miscarriage of justice resulted from a combination of the matters in the preceding grounds. 
        
       
      
    21 These grounds of appeal can only be fully appreciated against the factual background of the relevant circumstances of the case.  
     
      
    22 The Crown case was that the wounding of Shane Jones occurred in a flat at Lismore some time shortly after 7am on 8 September 2002. At the time the Crown alleged some six persons were present in the flat. They were Shane Jones, Austin Irvine, Rachel Edwards, John Green, the appellant and Dylan Walsh. The first four persons nominated were in the flat at all relevant times. The appellant and Dylan Walsh came to the flat some time shortly after 7o’clock. It was the Crown case that when the appellant and Walsh arrived at the flat they banged loudly at the door. Jones told them in florid terms to go away. Surprisingly, Jones then opened the door which resulted in a scuffle ensuing. The scuffle involved Jones, Walsh and the appellant. Sometime shortly thereafter Jones went to the bathroom to relieve himself and there became involved in a fight with Walsh. It was the Crown case that the Appellant became involved in that scuffle and that, during it, he stabbed Jones. The appellant then left the flat and shortly thereafter Walsh also left.  
     
      
    23 There was no issue that Jones had infact been stabbed and that the extent of the injuries he suffered were sufficient to ground the subject charge. An issue arose in the course of the trial as to who it was that had stabbed Jones. Jones and Irvine identified the appellant as being the assailant. The witnesses Green and Edwards while they overheard the altercation taking place in the bathroom did not see what happened. 
     
      
    24 Walsh’s evidence was somewhat diffuse. Having been declared unfavourable pursuant to s38 of the Evidence Act his evidence in chief took the form of cross examination on statements he had made to police. Furthermore he was granted a certificate pursuant to s128 of the Evidence Act that his evidence could not be used against him in criminal proceedings. He had given a number of statements to police. His first statement did not inculpate the appellant in any way. However in the statement given shortly before the trial commenced he said that he had been in the bathroom with Jones and the appellant and had seen a knife during the course of the scuffle which took place between the three of them. He said that the knife was not in his hands or in Jones but did not specifically say that he saw the knife in the appellant’s hands. Hence my description of his evidence being somewhat diffuse. 
     
      
    25 The suggestion that it was Walsh and not the appellant who had been the assailant came from the evidence of one Geoffrey McDonald. McDonald, of course, was not present during the relevant events. However, while incarcerated in the same prison as Walsh MacDonald stated that Walsh had confessed to him that he had been responsible for the assault upon Jones. 
     
      
    26 I turn then to the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    27 Ground 1: The trial miscarried as a result of (a) the learned trial Judge’s intervention in defence counsel’s address and (b) his Honour’s failure thereafter properly to direct the jury in relation to the standard of proof and the possibility that Dylan Walsh or another person committed the stabbing. 
     
      
    28 Near the end of defence counsel’s closing address the following exchange is recorded in the trial transcript:- 
     
      
       
        
        “POLACK: …I ask you to consider those things, but primarily it’s a situation if you think there’s a possibility that Dylan [Walsh] has done it or that any of the other person’s have actually done the stabbing, you should find the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No, no. That is not a proper submission. That confuses the question of reasonable doubt. Don’t do that.” 
        
       
      
    29 Earlier in his submissions defence counsel is recorded as saying “you may find there is a real possibility that it was someone other than Dylan or my client.” That was in the context of counsel submitting that it could be somebody other than the appellant who stabbed Jones.  
     
      
    30 It is in my view trite law that where there is identification of evidence which exculpates an accused a trial judge should instruct the jury that while there is no onus of proof upon an accused, it is sufficient in exculpation if upon the evidence adduced, a reasonable possibility exists or arises consistent with the innocence of the accused (see Pollitt v R (1990) 51 ACR 227; Mule v The Queen 2002 WASCA 101) 
     
      
    31 In the light of defence counsel’s use of the phrase ”reasonable possibility” earlier in his address his Honours intervention was in my view unwarranted. By intervening as he did his Honour in my view cast defence counsel in a light which might have encouraged the jury to believe that defence counsel could not be relied upon. As the issue of negative identification had been squarely raised through the evidence of McDonald it was in fact entirely proper for defence counsel to raise the matter in the way he did. If his Honour wished to remove any concept of remote possibility from the jury’s minds he could have done so by way of clear direction. In fact his Honour’s directions in relation to this topic are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: “ You might think that the defence case essentially is that you cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was not the young man, Dylan Walsh who stabbed Jones. Jones says it was not. Irvine says it was not and there were the earlier events…”  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        And at page 81: 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: “The defence case is, that, for reasons that cannot be known to him, the people downstairs have put their heads together to inculpate him and to an extent Walsh, instead of one of them. Or alternatively, that Walsh is the fly in the ointment and it was really Walsh who had the knife and that you should not believe Walsh and that you should not believe Irvine, who says that he saw the knife actually in the hand of the accused and when he was recalled, said that he had actually seen the last stabbing. Remember the onus rests on the prosecution and only the prosecution. There is no onus resting on the Accused and if you have any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused he must be given the benefit of that doubt and found not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    32 In my view these directions do not state the law in relation to negative identification. In essence the directions compound the problem caused by his Honour’s intervention in defence counsel’s address. It follows that in my view the appellant has made out this ground. 
     
      
    33 This of itself would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal. I should say that in relation to Ground 2 in my view his Honour erred particularly in relation to the matters raised by Grounds 2(a) and 2(b) of appeal. However in view of the conclusion I have reached as to Ground 1 I do not believe that it is necessary for this court to explore the matters raised in support of that ground.  
     
      
    34 In my view similar considerations apply to Ground 3.  
     
      
    35 However the extraordinary events which found Ground 4 of the appeal do call for this court in its supervisory role to deal with the matter raised.  
     
      
    36 Ground 4: The trial miscarried as a result of the trial judge’s intervention in the evidence of the witness Austin Irvine.  
     
      
    37 As I have already indicated earlier in these reasons Irvine was a witness who deposed that he had seen the scuffle in the bathroom involving the accused, Jones and Walsh. At the completion of Irvine’s evidence (there being no re-examination) his Honour permitted Irvine to stand down. His Honour then remarked as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: “Just a moment, stop that witness please. Has this witness been asked the question that – the direct question that he did not see Mr Ayoub stab Mr Jones.” 
        
       
      
    38 At that stage Irvine had not specifically stated that he had seen the appellant stab Jones. His Honour then went on to say to counsel for the accused as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: “Yes but if it’s your case that this man could not have seen that happen, because it didn’t happen, then it must be put to him in that form.”  
        
       
      
    39 After counsel for the accused had asked a number of questions discussions ensued in the absence of the jury as to Irvine’s recollection as to whether he saw the accused with the knife. When the jury returned his Honour is recorded as saying as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR:- “Bring the witness back please. As you would know, the alternative is that if the Browne and Dunn rule is not followed then it creates an extremely difficult situation, because the court is put in a situation where it’s either got to reject the question or reject the evidence that might be led, where there hasn’t been a compliance with the rule, that’s why it is so important to ignore it, those are two possibilities…”. 
        
       
       
      The accused’s counsel then took part in the following exchange with the witness and his Honour.  
       
       
        
        POLLACK:- Q. “All I have to put to you is that you did not see Mr Ayoub holding the knife? 
         
        A. You put to me that I didn’t see him holding the knife, is that what you said? 
         
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. Well you’re wrong. 
         
        HIS HONOUR:- All right, next question. 
         
        POLACK:- Q. I put it to you that you did not see Mr Ayoub using the knife? 
         
        A. The same answer. 
         
        HIS HONOUR:- Well that - -  
         
        Witness:- If there hadn’t been involved I wouldn’t have stepped in and stopped it. 
         
        HIS HONOUR:- Q. Yes, but did you actually see the motion of his body that was, in your view, the movement of his hand with a knife in it and the knife coming into contact with the body of Mr Jones?  
         
        A. He stabbed him, what else can I say, you know. 
         
        Q. Well stabbing consists of holding a knife in your hand? 
         
        A. Yeah 
         
        Q. And then by some movement, causing the knife to enter the person – the body of another person? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
        Q. At any time did you see the knife action – what you realised at the time to be a knife, actually strike Mr Jones body? 
         
        A. Yes I did, the last blow that hit him in the stomach.”  
        
       
      
    40 His Honour’s action in effectively forcing counsel for the accused to ask questions purportedly to comply with the rule in Browne v Dunn, in a situation where the witness up to that point had not given direct evidence that he had seen the accused stab Jones, was incorrect. The adversarial system does not require a judge to take such an action in the course of a trial – particularly where in fact no contravention of the subject rule had occurred. In other words his Honour’s action resulted in the accused being subjected to procedural unfairness. In short I find that this ground is also made out.  
     
      
    41 As is the case with Grounds 2 and 3 it is not necessary for me to deal with the matter raised by Ground 5. 
     
      
    42 Counsel for the appellant rightly conceded that this was not a case where he could successfully advance an argument that in the light of his client’s appeal being successful he could seek a verdict of acquittal from this court. This being so I am of the view that the following orders should be made:- 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal upheld. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Conviction quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        3. New trial ordered.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 IPP JA: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    2 The applicant was convicted on his own plea of guilty of three offences. Firstly, armed robbery committed on 21 May 2002; secondly, robbing one Robert Lalor, in circumstances where, immediately before the robbery, he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on Lalor; and, thirdly, being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely armed robbery. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty on the first offence was twenty years imprisonment, twenty years imprisonment on the second offence and, on the third offence, seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The sentencing judge, McGuire DCJ, sentenced the applicant under the third offence first. The sentence imposed was imprisonment for a fixed term of two years, the sentence to commence on 11 October 2002 and to expire on 10 October 2004.  
     
      
    5 His Honour then turned to the first and second offences. He sentenced the applicant on the first offence to imprisonment for a term of six years to commence on 11 October 2004 and to expire on 10 October 2010. He fixed a non-parole period of three years to commence on 11 October 2004 and to expire on 10 October 2007. In relation to the second offence, the judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a term of six years to commence on 11 October 2004 and to expire on 10 October 2010 and he fixed a non-parole period of three years to commence on 11 October 2004 and to expire on 10 October 2007, when he ordered him to be eligible for release on parole. It can be seen that the sentences in respect of the first and second offences were ordered to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was born on 12 May 1985, he was therefore seventeen years old at the time of the offences. He lived at home with his family and he was unemployed. 
     
      
    7 In dealing with the seriousness of the offences, the judge said that this was not a case of some callow youth performing a one-off crime. After the first robbery, the applicant was prepared to duplicate the violence involved in employing dangerous weapons to further the armed robbery ventures. 
     
      
    8 A very serious matter in this case is the consequences to the victims of the first and second offences perpetrated by the applicant. Mr Lalor was struck with a sledge-hammer during the course of the commission of the second offence. His wife said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I work in the same job, I am always frightened of strangers, or unusual incidents. I’ve become much more aggressive and defensive in my workplace. I cry at work for no apparent reason. I find the work so stressful now that I must drink alcohol just to go, where previously I rarely drank. This also upsets me, as I think of myself as an alcoholic, that is, I have no control over my drinking, where previously I drank only when I chose to … I never leave the house except for work or my husband’s many doctors’ appointments (at least three per week). I never socialise … I am depressed and think often of suicide but I am responsible for many people and have no options. As I earn less than $14 per hour, and am now the only breadwinner in my large family, I have no choice but to keep working in a job that makes me feel constantly threatened by people who choose to make money by damaging others.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Lalor said: 
       
       
        
        “As a result of this assault I received multiple fractures of my facial bones, a blow-out fracture of my right eye socket, cervical and upper thoracic spondylitis and minor facial cuts and abrasions. Surgery was performed to correct the multiple facial fractures. This surgery also disentangled the muscle of my right eye from bone fragments, a result of “a very large blow-out into the right maxillary sinus” and a silicon sheet was placed over the hole in the floor of my right eye socket. I also have suffered a partial loss of my sense of smell. I have suffered from long periods of anxiety and depression and, as a result I am still receiving counselling.  
        
       
       
        
        … My vision, as a result of this assault, has been adversely affected and I still suffer from double vision. After approximately six months I had regained some feeling in the right side of my face, however, I still suffer from partial numbness to the right side of my face, nose, eye, forehead and right temple. I suffer from chronic pain and stiffness in my neck and right shoulder and receive regular treatment to address my symptoms. I constantly suffer from nerve spasms in and around my nose and right eye.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour pointed out that there was ample medical evidence from a number of treating doctors to support Mr Lalor’s description of his injuries and his ongoing incapacities and symptoms. I think it is fair to say that Mr Lalor’s life has been affected, irredeemably, to a most serious degree. He is not able to work again, his wife has become the sole supporter of a family with children, and it is quite plain that she, too, has been harmfully affected in a most serious way by the conduct of the offenders. 
     
      
    10 It is not known who struck the blow to Mr Lalor but, as his Honour found, it must have been quite plain to the co-offenders, including the applicant, when embarking on their criminal ventures that any one of the weapons they took with them could inflict serious injuries on the victims of their intended crimes. 
     
      
    11 These matters underlay the approach taken by the sentencing judge and, although he did refer to the applicant’s youth and the absence of any prior convictions, it is quite plain that he was influenced by the deliberate nature of the crimes and the callousness with which the applicant used and was prepared to use violence in perpetrating them. In my view his honour was perfectly entitled to adopt the approach that he did. 
     
      
    12 Mr Dalton on behalf of the applicant has raised every issue that could possibly be raised. The most important ground that he argued on the applicant’s behalf was based on the parity principle. The argument was based on a sentence imposed by Nash ADCJ on a co-offender, one Niuqila, for the same offence as the third offence of which the applicant was convicted.  
     
      
    13 Niuqila was not involved in the first two offences, he was a co-offender only in regard to the third offence. He had a prior conviction for robbery that he committed three to four years before the offence was committed for which he received a twelve month period of recognisance. Nash ADCJ was required to sentence Niuqila for three principal offences. The first was receiving stolen property, for which the judge sentenced Niuqila to imprisonment for four months. The second was taking and driving a conveyance, the sentence for this offence was nine months imprisonment. The third was the same offence as the third offence for which the applicant in this case was convicted. For this offence Nash ADCJ sentenced Niuqila to imprisonment for a period of two years nine months with a non-parole period of one year four months. He ordered that all the sentences be concurrent with each other and, thus, Niuqila was sentenced to an overall fixed term, in effect, of one year four months imprisonment. 
     
      
    14 Mr Dalton submitted that the fixed term sentence of two years imposed on the applicant in this case, when compared to the sentence imposed on Niuqila, was contrary to the parity principle.  
     
      
    15 This submission warranted careful consideration, but I am satisfied that the parity principle is not of application. In the present case, the applicant had committed two serious offences before committing the third offence. The first of the prior offences being committed some six months before the third offence, and the second being some two months before. Each of these two previous offences involved the perpetration of violence, the second in a most harmful way, as I have mentioned. Even though there is no proof that the applicant was the one who wielded the sledge-hammer on Mr Lalor, the violence involved bears significantly on the criminality of the applicant’s conduct in the sense that it demonstrates, in regard to the third offence, that, notwithstanding his knowledge of what the use of dangerous weapons could lead to, he was quite prepared to go along with preparations to commit a like offence again. That is to say, notwithstanding that he knew of the kind of harm that had been done to Mr Lalor, he was prepared two months later to attempt to embark on some other criminal venture, with co-offenders, and being equipped with weapons that could cause serious injury once more. 
     
      
    16 Here was an instance of deliberate planning in which the applicant was involved, deliberate planning to commit serious crimes on a now third occasion in the full knowledge that what he was doing could cause life threatening harm to individuals and cause innocent families to suffer in a terrible way. The applicant did not appear to care about that, and he was quite prepared to continue with what really amounted to a crime spree. 
     
      
    17 Niuqila’s criminal conduct was not of the same kind. For this reason I do not regard the parity principle as having been of application, and I consider that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for the third offence was appropriate. 
     
      
    18 Mr Dalton then pointed to a remark made by the judge that “[t]here was no personal expression of regret, remorse, contrition or intended reformation, no apology to the victims of his robberies”. Mr Dalton has demonstrated that there was material before his Honour which did indicate that the applicant had, to Department of Juvenile Justice officers, made remarks indicating that he felt a high level of empathy with his victims, that he felt bad for what he did, he felt shameful not only in regard to the disgrace that he had brought on his own family, but because of the way in which members of the public had been hurt by his criminal actions. 
     
      
    19 In this respect the judge erred, but in my opinion this error is insignificant when regard is had to the very serious criminality of the applicant in relation to each one of the three offences. 
     
      
    20 In my view it would have been open to the trial judge to increase the sentences beyond those that he imposed on the applicant. In addition, the judge ordered that the first offence be served concurrently with the second. In this last respect the judge exercised his discretion compassionately towards the applicant. He did not have to make such an order. He did so because of the applicant’s youth and because the applicant has undoubtedly a respectable, hardworking, good and caring family and there is a prospect of the applicant’s rehabilitation once he has completed his sentence. In my view the applicant should consider himself fortunate. It was open, as I have said, for the judge to have sentenced him to a more substantial term. Taking these aspects into account I am unpersuaded that the judgment should be affected by the judge’s error in finding that there was no personal expression of regret, et cetera. 
     
      
    21 Another point raised by Mr Dalton in his written submissions was that his Honour wrongly found that the combination of offences was a significant factor, not only when determining that the applicant should be dealt with according to law, but also in giving only limited consideration to the applicant’s youth. Mr Dalton, however, in oral submissions, rightly accepted that, when the judge’s sentencing remarks are analysed, it is apparent that his references to the combination of offences were only to his decision to deal with the applicant at law. 
     
      
    22 Mr Dalton also suggested that the totality of the sentences was extreme and excessive, but for the reasons I have explained, I am not persuaded of that. 
     
      
    23 For those reasons, while I would grant the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    24 HULME J: In his victim impact statement Mr Lalor said this, “I still cannot come to terms with how one human being could even contemplate using a sledge hammer as a weapon against another human being, let alone actually use it to assault someone.” With that statement I completely agree. 
     
      
    25 Two of the matters to be taken into account in sentencing are retribution – the community’s entitlement to feel that justice has been done – and protection of the community. When regard is had to this serious injury suffered to Mr Lalor, innocent of any misconduct completely, I would very much doubt whether the community would feel that justice has been done in this case 
     
      
    26 I also very much doubt whether the protection of the community is adequately dealt with by sentences of this length in the case of thugs as the appellant apparently is for, as the presiding judge has pointed out, after the first two of his offences he was quite content to join equally thuggish colleagues in yet another potentially violent armed robbery. 
     
      
    27 However, there has been no Crown appeal and in those circumstances there is no opportunity in this Court to impose any higher sentence than has been imposed. One can but hope, as the trial judge seems to have thought, that the applicant will in fact be rehabilitated and be able to pursue the rest of his life in a decent respectable manner. 
     
      
    28 I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge and with his Honour’s reasons.  
     
      
    29 HISLOP J: I also agree with Justice Ipp. 
     
      
    30 IPP J: The order of the Court will be that while the application for leave to appeal against sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Hislop J. 
     
      
    3 HISLOP J: On 7 August 2003 the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated robbery contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 95(1). The maximum penalty for such offence is twenty years imprisonment. On 28 October 2003 Ellis DCJ sentenced the applicant to two years and six months imprisonment for that offence commencing on 28 October 2003 with a non-parole period of one year and three months.  
     
      
    4 His Honour recommended that the sentence be served in juvenile detention. This recommendation could not be carried out as the applicant was over the age of eighteen at the time of the offence. The recommendation was withdrawn on 30 October 2003. The applicant has served the sentence to date in adult gaols. 
     
      
    5 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The written grounds of appeal assert:  
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentencing Judge applied a wrong principle, in that his Honour interpreted the applicable guideline judgment as meaning that any sentence other than full time imprisonment would have been erroneous.  
        
       
       
      2. The sentence is manifestly excessive.”  
       
       
      On the hearing of the appeal an additional ground was advanced as a “fall back” position in case the filed grounds did not find favour with the Court. In essence the ground was that his Honour’s approach to imposing the sentence in accordance with the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”) s 44  
      as it had been amended in 2002 had led to an increase in the term of the sentence by the finding of special circumstances rather than a reduction of the non-parole period.  
      
    6 The facts, as found by his Honour, were as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “… on 29 May 2003 at Parramatta, in the company of two other men, the offender and two other males approached the area in which the victim was speaking to two females. Shortly after the offender walked up to and approached the victim who was seated at a bench waiting for a lift, the offender stood with his right leg between the victim’s legs with his knees nearly touching the bench upon which the victim was seated, and he indicated to the victim “I’m going to take your wallet”. The offender then reached forward and took the victim by the throat with both hands, squeezing as he did so, the force of which cut off the air supply to the victim. Whilst doing that, he forced the victim backwards onto the seat, causing his head to strike the brick wall behind. Fearing for his life, the victim punched and kicked the defendant. He fought the offender and forced him off. When he did this, the other two males encircled the victim and began to punch the victim to the body and the head. It was then that one of the males took the victim’s backpack from him. The offender came to the front of the victim and punched the victim once to the face. The victim was forced to the ground by tripping. Once on the ground, he was continually kicked to the torso and head area. He managed to stand up and hit one of the males. He was then taken from behind with his arms pinned and the offender came towards him again, but the victim managed to kick the offender away. After the offender did that he was thrown to the ground. He again was very fearful but stood and was hit to the head from behind by the offender and thrown onto the ground… The victim received a split to his lower lip that bled freely, teeth on the left side of his mouth were loose, his jaw was stiff and hard to move, his ribs on both sides of his torso were sore, both arms were sore from defending himself and his back was sore and stiff. The victim was approximately 170 centimetres tall and weighed a mere 60 kilograms. The offender standing before me certainly is a far larger young man than the victim.”  
        
       
       
      The attack ceased only upon the intervention of police officers who chanced upon the scene.  
      
     
     
      
      Ground One 
       
      
    7 His Honour held that the starting point for determining any sentence involving an offence of this type was the sentencing guideline in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 where the majority of the Court determined that when sentencing an offender for an offence involving characteristics similar to the present a full time sentence of between four to five years was warranted. It was appropriate for his Honour to take that as a starting point and I do not understand the contrary to be asserted. 
     
      
    8 It is clear that the imposition of a non-custodial sentence in a case within the Henry guideline is not excluded thereby though the imposition of such a sentence is confined to “exceptional cases” see Spigelman CJ in Henry at [210]. 
     
      
    9 The applicant has submitted that his Honour proceeded on the erroneous understanding that where the guideline judgment had application it was mandatory that a custodial sentence be imposed. 
     
      
    10 The applicant relied upon comments made in the judgment that there was “no option other than a sentence of full time custody”. Those comments were made initially in the context of a discussion of general sentencing principles in relation to ss 3A and 21A of the Act and again immediately before the imposition of sentence. Those comments, read in their context, do not suggest to my mind that his Honour was under the misapprehension alleged, particularly as earlier in his judgment his Honour had stated the guideline “ought to be complied with unless there are reasons for deviating from it”. His Honour was saying simply that in the circumstances of this case a sentence of full time custody was appropriate. 
     
      
    11 In my opinion the first ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two 
       
      
    12 His Honour found that there were reasons why the guideline should be departed from in this case. Those reasons, shortly stated, were that the applicant was young (date of birth 8 September 1984); had a somewhat dislocated upbringing; his relationship with his father had been problematic; he had completed his schooling attending classes regularly and posing no disciplinary problems; he was in permanent employment; he was of prior good character and had no prior convictions; he had shown remorse; there were good prospects of rehabilitation; he had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity; he had been involved in a motor accident in April 2002 in which he had suffered significant head injuries. 
     
      
    13 The submissions for the applicant focussed upon the last matter, it being accepted, as I understand it, that, but for this factor, it could not be contended the case was “exceptional”.  
     
      
    14 As to the injuries in the motor accident his Honour made extensive reference to a treating doctor’s report. His Honour stated inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it may be said that the significant brain trauma suffered by the offender may reduce the significance of general deterrence in the sense that that injury has certainly made him more susceptible to both anger and to being led by others, and to reduction of his ability to control angry responses or spontaneous outbursts” and “… perhaps he did not have a full appreciation of his actions and there is no doubt that his medical condition may well have contributed to his inability to think rationally and to control his impulses”.  
        
       
      
    15 The sentencing Judge gave due weight to all of these considerations in determining the sentence which he imposed. The sentence reflects the appropriate punishment with regard to the objective criminality involved, (i.e. a cowardly attack of which the applicant was the instigator upon an innocent victim causing the victim actual physical injury which attack came to an end only upon the fortuitous arrival of the police) balanced against the personal circumstances of the applicant. 16 In Whittaker v The King (1928) 41 CLR 230 at 249 Isaacs J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “a decision of the primary Judge: “must… be regarded as prima facie correct, and, in order that it should be displaced, it must be shown, … that it is “not merely (excessive), but manifestly so, because the learned Judge in imposing it either proceeded upon wrong principles, or undervalued or overestimated some of the material features of the evidence”.  
        
       
      
    17 In R v Tate (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388 it was held:  
     
      
       
        
        “ an appellant Court does not interfere with the sentence imposed merely because it is of the view that that sentence is insufficient or excessive. It interferes only if it be shown that the sentencing Judge was in error in acting on a wrong principle, or in misunderstanding or in wrongly assessing some salient feature of the evidence. The error may appear in what the sentencing Judge said in the proceedings, or the sentence itself may be so excessive or inadequate as to manifest such error”. 
        
       
      
    18 In my opinion the sentence imposed by his Honour was well open to him on the evidence and no error has been demonstrated in that regard. In my opinion the second ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
      Ground Three  
       
      
    19 The 2002 amendments to the Act have application in this case. 
     
      
    20 Section 44 of the Act, as amended, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the Court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the Court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).” 
        
       
      
    21 In the course of his remarks his Honour indicated that he had found that there were special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Act and stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am required by the Act to fix a non-parole period, and thereafter to fix an additional period, that additional period is fixed as a percentage of the non parole period, unless special circumstances exist justifying a longer than statutory period of rehabilitation.” 
        
       
      
    22 The argument advanced on behalf of the applicant is that this passage reveals that his Honour thought that the section required him to fix the non-parole period and then to consider whether there were special circumstances in order to determine whether to increase the “additional period” for the purposes of the applicant’s rehabilitation. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 and that part of the Court’s judgment considering the role of special circumstances under s 44, in particular the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “111 The view that was taken in  
        R v Moffit  
        (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 in relation to the former s 5 of the  
        Sentencing Act  
        did not require the sentencing judge to first determine a minimum term, which was thereafter immutable, notwithstanding a subsequent finding of special circumstances. In substance, the section specifies the sequence in which the sentence was to be set, focussing upon the period which was considered appropriate to be served by way of a minimum period of actual imprisonment, followed by the period for a potential supervised release on parole.  
        
       
       
        
        112 While there are separate considerations involved for s 44(2) of the Act, they need not be regarded as involving a two-step or sequential process since, as Spigelman CJ pointed out in  
        R v Hampton  
         (1998) 44 NSWLR 729, the relevant steps can be taken simultaneously.” 
        
       
      
    23 It is plain that his Honour was simply indicating in terms of s 44 how he was required to impose the sentence and not indicating the manner in which he was to determine how the sentence was to be derived. The applicant’s submission carries with it the inference that the Judge believed that the section required him to increase a sentence for the purposes of accommodating the applicant’s rehabilitation by the finding of special circumstances. Such a proposition is so inconsistent with general sentencing theory and with the interpretation of a similarly worded provision in the former Sentencing Act that it should not be attributed to a sentencing judge without it being overwhelmingly apparent that this was the approach adopted.  
     
      
    24 In any event the sentence imposed clearly proves, if proof is required, that his Honour did not approach his sentencing task in that way. The non-parole period fixed could not have been considered as appropriate unless his Honour had reduced it by finding of special circumstances to provide the applicant with a longer period on parole for the benefit of his rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    25 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Appeal dismissed.

     REGINA v ROBERT BRIAN GRBIN 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an application for leave to appeal by Robert Brian Grbin against the sentence imposed on him by his Honour Judge B R Maguire QC in the District Court at Campbelltown following his plea of guilty to one count of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, which offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000. 2 After taking into account a number of matters on a Form 1, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for two years and eight months and fixed a non-parole period of two years.3 The further offences taken into account on the Form 1 were deemed supply of ecstasy, possession of methylamphetamine for the purpose of supply, deemed supply of methylamphetamine, deemed supply of ecstasy and unlawful possession of testosterone steroid tablets. 4 The applicant performed security duties at the entrance gate to Holsworthy Army Barracks. I note that he was a security guard and not a member of the Armed Forces. 5 On the late afternoon of Friday 29 November 2002, an undercover police officer using the name of “Sean” passed through the security gates staffed by the applicant and another security officer. Sean took the applicant aside and indicated he wanted to buy some “whizza”. After the applicant had satisfied himself there was nothing untoward, he led Sean to a nearby car from which he took two small resealable plastic bags containing 1.19 grams of methylamphetamine which he handed to Sean in exchange for $80. Before parting and referring to their earlier conversation between the two of them before the applicant supplied the drug, the applicant said, “Sorry for running you through the third degree but I didn’t know if you were an MP or not.” 6 On the late afternoon of Monday 2 December 2002, Sean drove to the security gates at Holsworthy Army Barracks where the applicant was working. Upon asking the applicant if there was “any chance of scoring the same today?” he was ushered into the security booth of the gates. There the applicant handed him two resealable plastic bags containing 1.11 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $80.7 During the course of their conversation, the applicant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mate, I can get you whatever you want, Eccy’s or grass. I can get you as much speed as you want, I get it straight from the maker, I‘m not gonna bullshit ya, it’s cut with glucose, what you get is a third of the real stuff.” 
        
       
      
    8 It was agreed that Sean would return the next day and obtain another $70 worth of drugs. The applicant gave Sean his mobile telephone number and told him to send an SMS message before coming because “there’s been some guys from here have been smashed.” 9 The following afternoon, Tuesday 3 December, Sean drove to the gate at the barracks where the applicant was working. Inside the security booth near the boom gate the applicant gave Sean a resealable plastic bag containing 1.70 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $70. The applicant said he had more if he wanted it, but Sean said he did not have the money. The applicant also said that he could get grass and ecstasy if Sean wanted it in the future, that it was good and came from The Netherlands.10 Later that afternoon at about 7pm the applicant was arrested. Inside his security booth were found four white ecstasy tablets in the shape of four-leaf clovers and a bottle containing testosterone steroid tablets. In a small pouch attached to his car key ring, a small resealable bag with .51 grams of methylamphetamine was found.  
     
      
    11 At the same time as his arrest, other police went to his house at Albion Park with a search warrant where they found three resealable bags containing four grams of methylamphetamine in the refrigerator and sixteen ecstasy tablets totalling 3.85 grams in two plastic bags in a sunglasses case in the bedroom. 12 On his arrest the applicant told the police where to look for drugs in his house during the search and following his arrest he took part in a recorded interview in which he admitted the offences, although he claimed he was only supplying a few mates, a statement which his Honour did not accept, and there was evidence which justified his Honour’s attitude in that regard.13 He pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence where he adhered to his plea. Both he and his wife gave evidence on sentence. The applicant admitted his guilt and expressed remorse for his actions. 14 In his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour noted that the applicant was born on 7 August 1965 and was, at the time of sentencing, aged thirty-eight years. He had been married for eighteen years. He had three children, aged 18, 15 and 8. The oldest was in part-time work and studying, the second was at school and the third was also at school but had problems, which I will refer to shortly.15 The applicant had previous convictions more than twenty years ago for serious offences, namely, armed robbery, two counts of break enter and steal and two counts of larceny of a motor vehicle. He had spent some time in juvenile institutions and with remissions had served eight months in an adult gaol before being released to parole. Those offences were in 1982 and 1983. Since then the applicant had married and with his wife was raising his family. 16 His Honour also accepted that his wife suffered from clinical depression and was receiving treatment for it.17 The applicant had been in regular employment but had lost his job at the Holsworthy Barracks when arrested. He had, however, obtained other work in the meantime. Apart from a Mr Bedoe, who gave evidence before his Honour as to the applicant’s good character, there were a number of testimonials before the sentencing judge attesting to his character and generosity. 18 His Honour noted that the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity but went on to observe that the prosecution case against him was a strong one and noted he had not identified his suppliers or his other customers. 19 This suggests that his Honour failed to regard the utilitarian value of the plea as something separate from the value of the plea as evidencing remorse and contrition. 20 While the strength of the prosecution case is relevant to the plea of guilty as evidence of contrition, authority establishes that it is not relevant to the utilitarian value of the plea: R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 at [137] and see also R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 at [18] and [149]. Moreover, his Honour made no express reference to a discount for the plea of guilty, particularly for its utilitarian value nor did he quantify it in any way. 21 In R v Thomson and Houlton at [160], Spiegelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, drew a distinction between the utilitarian value of such a plea and its relevance to evidence of contrition, and witness vulnerability and other considerations, and laid down the following guidelines: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight.  
         
         
        (2) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant ... ... but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the (utilitarian value) ...  
         
         
        (3) The utilitarian value of the plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of ten to twenty-five per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range of a particular case you fall is the timing of the plea.” 
        
       
      
    22 Previously, when dealing specifically with the utilitarian value of the plea, his Honour had said, at [153]-[154]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The determination of where within such a range the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. There are, however, two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case:  
         
         
          
          (i) The time at which the plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing which, in turn, has a greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
      His Honour concluded his judgment by saying at para 162: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of identifying a discount range is to improve the transparency of the (sentencing) process and to alter the widespread perception that there is no benefit from an early plea.” 
        
       
      
    23 In the present case, not only does his Honour appear to have confused the strength of the Crown case with the utilitarian value of the plea, but he has not indicated that any discount has been allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea or the extent of any such discount. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that his Honour fell into error.24 The other ground relied on by the applicant is his Honour’s failure to find special circumstances justifying a variation in the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period indicated by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, particularly having regard to the hardship occasioned to the applicant’s young son and the rest of the family by reason of the son’s disabilities.25 There was evidence before his Honour that the son Jed, now aged eight years, has been diagnosed as suffering with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a moderate developmental disability. 26 The child is under medical supervision and takes medication for his disorder. This is a clinical autism and not one of the milder forms that are currently recognised. His form of autism is not that the child is passive and inactive, but rather the opposite and he requires constant supervision and management. He was, for a time in a satellite school but has now been admitted to a special class at the local public school. Persons with his disorder have a disconcerting habit of running away without notice and have little or no comprehension of social rules and normal road rule behaviour, and he requires constant supervision. 27 There was also evidence before his Honour that there was a special bond between the applicant and his son which was of great benefit to the management and supervision of the son, and evidence filed for the hearing of the appeal indicates that his son is missing his father and his father’s absence is making him more difficult to manage. This evidence, of course, is only relevant in the event that the Court comes to re-sentence. 28 The general rule is that hardship to members of an offender’s family is generally irrelevant and can only be taken into account in highly exceptional circumstances, and the care of young children is not normally an exceptional circumstance: R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516 where Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The real difficulty about a case such as the present, as many other cases in which imprisonment of an offender causes hardship to a third party, is to identify a ground upon which they can properly and relevantly be regarded as exceptional. Regrettably, causing hardship to third parties by imprisonment of an offender is only too common.” 
         
        
       
      
    29 However, there are cases where having regard to the particular circumstances the case has been held to be exceptional, for example R v Maslen (1995) 79 A Crim R 199 where the child was grossly disabled, and R v Bednarz [2000] NSWCCA 533 where, once again, the child was disabled and it was held that the particular difficulties of the child constituted exceptional circumstances justifying a finding of special circumstances and reduction in the non-parole period. 30 His Honour accepted the medical evidence in relation to the son’s condition and referred to the fact that it is only in a case of exceptional circumstances that a crime of this nature can go unpunished by a full-time custodial sentence, but said that he found no such exceptional circumstances existed here and made no specific reference to special circumstances although the issue had been raised in submission. 31 In my view, the circumstances here were not sufficiently exceptional to justify a non-custodial sentence, I consider that it was sufficiently exceptional to justify some consideration being given to it, and a suitable case to justify a finding of special circumstances. 32 As I say, his Honour did not refer specifically to special circumstances, and although there is no obligation to do so, R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, it is desirable that judges at first instance do refer specifically to whether they have considered special circumstances, whether they find them established, and if so, whether or not they find such special circumstances sufficient to justify a variation of the ratio referred to in s 44(2): R v Brindley (1993) 66 A Crim R 204.33 As I say in this case I consider that the son’s condition, and the need for his father’s assistance in his supervision and management constituted an exceptional circumstance such as to justify a finding of special circumstances and a reduction in what would otherwise have been the non-parole period. 34 There is, in my view, another matter which is relevant to a finding of special circumstances in this case and that is the fact that, having committed a number of serious offences when young, aged seventeen and eighteen, and having served a gaol sentence in respect of those offences, the applicant has apparently led an honest and law-abiding life for over twenty years since then, during which time he has married and had been raising a family, and throughout that time has been in regular employment. Such rehabilitation is to be encouraged even if he ultimately falls, as he has done on this case. 35 In my view, the errors disclosed by his Honour render it appropriate for this Court to re-sentence.36 In my view, an appropriate starting point for this offence was a sentence of three and a half years imprisonment. From that I would allow a discount of twenty-five per cent for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty and also referable to the other elements of remorse and so on. This would reduce the sentence to thirty-one-and-a-half months, which is almost the same as the head sentence imposed by his Honour of two years and eight months, which I would not vary. However, in my view, the son’s condition and the applicant’s rehabilitation over 20 years constitutes special circumstances, and I would reduce the non-parole period to one year. 37 I would, therefore, propose that the Court grant the applicant leave to appeal. I would confirm the head sentence of two years and eight months, but I would quash the non-parole period and in lieu thereof I would fix a non-parole period of one year, commencing on 29 August 2003 and expiring on 28 August 2004.38 I would further order that on that date the applicant be released on parole subject to the conditions prescribed by the Regulations. 39 LEVINE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Dunford J and his reasons therefore.40 HOWIE J: I also agree.41 LEVINE J: The orders will be as proposed by his Honour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: Between 4 and 25 January 2000, the appellant Ian Ormond Cox was tried before Gibson DCJ and a jury on a charge that he “between about 1 January 1997 and 21 November 1997 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Michael Reardon, Douglas Crombie, Haydee Martinez Diaz, Lily Villegas and divers other persons to import into Australia prohibited imports to which section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, to wit, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of cocaine being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to cocaine”. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and on 10 March 2000 the appellant was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 15 years, to date from 21 November 1997.  
     
      
    2 On 12 July 2000, the appellant pleaded guilty before Mahoney DCJ to a charge that he “between about 1 February 1997 and about 8 June 1997 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with Craig Kant and others to import into Australia prohibited imports to which section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, to wit, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of cannabis resin being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to cannabis resin”. On 17 July 2000, the appellant was sentenced on this charge to 14 years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five years, each to date from 21 November 2012. On 12 November 2001, Blanch CJ corrected a technical defect in the sentence, by fixing a single non-parole period of 20 years to run from 21 November 1997. 
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the charge relating to cocaine, and seeks leave to appeal against his sentences on both matters.  
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE ON THE COCAINE CHARGE 
      
    4 At the trial, there was no dispute that there had been a conspiracy to import 50 kilograms of cocaine into Australia, or that Michael Reardon was one of the conspirators: the issue raised by the appellant was whether the appellant was one of the persons involved in this conspiracy. 
     
      
    5 The Crown case was that the conspiracy commenced in January 1997, and that the appellant was the proprietor of a wine importing business which was to be used for the importation of the cocaine.  
     
      
    6 A significant part of the Crown case consisted of recordings of conversations between W, a registered informant of the National Crime Authority (NCA), and Reardon between June and October 1997. In one conversation, on 13 June 1997, Reardon is recorded as saying “Knowing the bloke whose bringing it over he’s alright”, and agreeing to the effect that he was connected with wine; not “in the wine” but “he’s got another way of doing it”. In another conversation, on 17 June 1997, Reardon is recorded as responding to a question “The wine guy has got everything organised?” with the words “Yeah, he’s right”. In a further conversation of 1 October 1997, Reardon is recorded as talking about a “Canberra guy” and a “wine guy”, who were both from Canberra and were mates. The Crown case was that the references in these conversations to a person connected with wine, and to a “wine guy”, were references to the appellant. 
     
      
    7 There was evidence that Reardon flew from Sydney on 21 July 1997 to go to Chile, and returned to Sydney from Chile on 9 August 1997; and that he again flew from Sydney to go to Chile on 1 October 1997, and returned on 21 November 1997. There was evidence that the appellant flew from Sydney to go to Chile on 10 October 1997, and returned to Sydney from Chile on 18 October 1997.  
     
      
    8 There were in evidence facsimiles sent from Santiago Chile by Reardon to W. One dated 6 October 1997 stated that the “Canberra man will be here on the 10th”. The appellant in fact arrived in Santiago on 10 October 1997. Another, dated 11 October 1997, stated that “Canberra man is here, but can’t see him until 8.30 Monday morning” (that is, 13 October 1997). Another, dated 18 October 1997, stated that “Canberra man has left me with a lot more work to do”. 
     
      
    9 There were in evidence written communications between the appellant, on the letterhead “Columbus Wines”, and one Guy Hooper of Santa Innis Vineyard in Chile, dated 17 September 1997, 6 October 1997, 20 October 1997 and 31 October 1997, relating to the purchase for importation into Australia of about 850 cases of wine for a price of about $US24,000.00. The wine was to be in a container to be delivered to “Tradewings” no later than 14 November 1997. According to the correspondence, there was “quite a lot of furniture to be packed in on top of the wine”.  
     
      
    10 There were also in evidence written communications between the appellant and Neil Taylor of Tradewings Limited, a freight forwarding concern in Santiago, Chile. One letter dated 16 October 1997 referred to a container with about 850 cases of wine to be delivered to the depot, the expected delivery being on 24 October 1997. This letter stated that “a representative of mine” will need to check the goods; and that “additional goods, furniture and corking machine will be delivered soon after to be packed in with the wine”. The Crown case was that the representative referred to in this letter was the appellant. 
     
      
    11 There were also in evidence records of telephone conversations between the appellant and Hooper on 31 October 1997 and 18 November 1997; between the appellant and Reardon on 11 November 1997 and 12 November 1997; and between the appellant and Taylor on 12 November 1997 and 13 November 1997. The Crown case was that the terms of these conversations were such as to indicate that the appellant’s agreement and understanding was that cocaine was to be placed in with the cases of wine in the container to which I have referred.  
     
      
    12 Evidence was given by a number of witnesses in the Crown case. Of particular significance, in the light of the appellant’s defence, were Mr. Taylor and certain Chilean police officers, and in particular an officer called Oscar Alvarez.  
     
      
    13 Mr. Taylor gave evidence that in early October 1997, the appellant arrived unexpectedly at his office, together with a man introduced by the appellant as Mr. Harris. It is common ground that this man was in fact Reardon. Mr. Taylor gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Now, what happened when the accused and this man introduced by the name of Mark Harris arrived at your office in October 1997; what happened? 
         
        A. Well, basically Mr Cox told me that he was back from Chile in order to make some purchase of wine and he would like to ship it to Australia so he had to return back to Australia. Mr Harris would stay behind and coordinate the delivery of the wine to the warehouse. 
         
         
        Q. And was there anything else said in that conversation, mention of anything else, apart from the wine, that was going to Australia? 
         
        A. Yes, he wanted to ship some machine or wine corking for corking bottles; an old machine and some furnitures. 
         
         
        Q. And did you ask either Mr Cox or the man introduced to you as mark Harris for a contact number or address? 
         
        A. Yes, he was staying - I needed to have a phone number or address or fax where to reach him in order to let him know when there was a vessel sailing and they didn't give me any phone number or address or where to reach them. 
         
         
        Q. Did you ask for a phone number or address?  
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Who did you ask? 
         
        A. I asked Mr Cox and Mr Harris that I needed some number to reach them, because I cannot just sit back and wait to be approached by them in order to ship the cargo. 
         
         
        Q. What was said to you? 
         
        A. That Mr Harris would be moving up and down and that he would have no regular place where he would stay so he would contact me. 
         
         
        Q. Who said that?  
         
        A. Mr Cox. 
        
       
      
    14 Mr. Taylor also gave evidence that he later received the letter dated 16 October 1997 referred to in par.[13] above, which Mr. Taylor said was handed to him by his secretary on 16 or 17 October 1997, having been left in his office at a time when Mr. Taylor was not there.  
     
      
    15 Mr. Alvarez gave evidence of contact with Reardon in 1997, in the course of which he gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Can I take you next to 10 October, the 10th, 1997. I think on that day you met with Reardon and the two of you went for a walk from the Hotel Lota? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Is that correct? 
         
        A. (No verbal response). 
         
         
        Q. And during the course, whilst you were walking, did he say something to you about somebody coming to Santiago?  
         
        A. Yes, he told me that he wanted to check in the Centra Apartments if one of his friends was arriving there because that man was in charge of arranging the container to transport the drugs to Australia. That hotel, apartments, Centra Apartments Hotel was very close to the Apartment Lota. When we arrived there we entered the lobby and he asked for a man who worked there like a receptionist. He say, ""I want to know if Mr Ian Cox is booked here?"" And the receptionist checked the information on the computer and I saw on the screen the man Cox Ian. And he told Mr Reardon that that man was coming from Australia and he was booked there from 13 to 17 October 1997. 
         
         
        Q. And before you heard the name Ian Cox mentioned by Reardon and before you saw the name on the computer, had you heard that name before? 
         
        A. Never. That was the first time. 
        
       
      
    16 Other Chilean police officers gave evidence that they had observed the appellant with Reardon during the day on 13 October 1997.  
     
      
    17 The appellant’s case was that he had not known Reardon prior to the evening of 13 October 1997, when he met him by chance at dinner; and that Mr. Reardon introduced himself as Mark Harris, and asked him to call him “Mick”. The appellant’s evidence was to the effect that he took Reardon to meet Mr. Taylor on 16 October 1997, and that it was then that he handed directly to Mr. Taylor his letter dated 16 October 1997. According to the appellant, any subsequent involvement of Reardon with the appellant’s proposed shipment of wine to Australia arose entirely from the chance meeting on the evening of 13 October 1997.  
     
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    18 The appellant’s Notice of Appeal raised three grounds of appeal against conviction, namely: 
     
      
      1. The verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the evidence. 
       
      2. The evidence of telephone conversations intercepted and recorded without warrant should not have been admitted. 
       
      3. There is additional material available as fresh evidence which renders the verdict of the jury as unreasonable, and the trial proceedings unfair to the appellant. 
       
      
    19 However, the appellant, who was unrepresented on his conviction appeal, provided extensive written submissions, indicating the following thirteen grounds of appeal: 
     
      
      1. Unsafe and unsatisfactory verdict. 
       
      2. Failure of judge to give proper directions or warnings in relation to a number of matters. 
       
      3. Errors in admitting certain evidence. 
       
      4. Perceived bias. 
       
      5. Failure to discharge jury. 
       
      6. The  
      Ridgeway 
       principle. 
       
      7. Illegal and improper conduct of police. 
       
      8. Fresh evidence. 
       
      9. Wilful withholding of material/documents. 
       
      10. Considerations relating to another case involving the witness W. 
       
      11. Statements and evidence of Chilean police. 
       
      12. Issues arising from running sheets. 
       
      13. Error concerning evidence about photograph said to be of Canberra man. 
       
       
      The material also contained detailed submissions alleging false evidence by Chilean police and other witnesses. 
       
      
    20 As regards the sentence appeal, on which the appellant was represented by Ms. Mundey, there was only one ground, namely that the sentences were manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances.  
     
      
    21 The appeal was argued on 13 November 2003. The appellant sought an adjournment to take further steps to obtain legal representation on his appeal against conviction, and also to take further steps in relation to disclosure of National Crime Authority (NCA) running sheets. Also, at that time there was outstanding an application by Reardon, who had been convicted of involvement in the same conspiracy and whose appeal against that conviction had been dismissed, to re-open the hearing of his appeal on the basis of Crown non-disclosure of NCA running sheets. As noted above, at his trial the appellant had conceded that there was a conspiracy and that Reardon was one of the conspirators. In the event that Reardon’s application was successful, the appellant wished to make further submissions; and the Court indicated that it would give that opportunity in that event. The appellant’s adjournment application was refused.  
     
      
    22 I drew the appellant’s attention to the circumstance that I was one of the judges dealing with Reardon’s application, and no objection was raised to my participation in this appeal. Reardon’s application was dismissed on 23 June 2004, so that the Court is now in a position to give its decision on the appellant’s appeal without any further hearing.  
     
      
    23 I will deal with the issues arising on this appeal under the following headings:  
     
      
      1. Alleged defects in directions and warnings (original ground 2). 
       
      2. Alleged errors in admitting evidence (original ground 2, submissions grounds 3 and 13). 
       
      3. Perceived bias (submissions ground 4). 
       
      4. Failure to discharge jury (submissions ground 5). 
       
      5. Illegal conduct of police (submissions grounds 6 and 7). 
       
      6. Evidence of Chilean police and other witnesses (submissions ground 11, supplementary material). 
       
      7. Fresh evidence, non-disclosure (original ground 3, submissions grounds 9 and 12).  
       
      8. Unreasonable verdict (original ground 1, submissions ground 1). 
       
      9. Sentence appeal.  
       
      
    24 As regards ground 10 in the submissions, this related to what occurred in another case, and has no relevance to this appeal. 
     
      
       
      ALLEGED DEFECTS IN DIRECTIONS AND WARNINGS 
      
    25 The appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to give adequate directions on the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, to the effect that the hypothesis put forward by the Crown should be not merely rational but the only rational hypothesis; and failed to give adequate directions concerning the evidence of the informer W, concerning his character, motivation, criminal record and the circumstance that he was a paid informer. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion, no error has been identified, and the directions given were appropriate in the circumstances. 
     
      
       
      ERRORS IN ADMITTING EVIDENCE 
      
    27 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in admitting the following matters into evidence. First, telephone conversations recorded by W on his mobile phone, in the absence of a warrant. Second, concerning items allegedly found in Reardon’s hotel room in Chile, on the basis of lack of continuity, the prejudicial nature of the evidence, and on the basis that the evidence had been tampered with. Third, all listening device and telephone conversation tapes, because only a selected few had been used by the Crown and the Crown had supplied inaccurate transcripts. Fourth, conversations recorded by W prior to the obtaining a warrant under the Customs Act, that is during the nineteen days between 11 June 1997 and 30 June 1997. Finally, in permitting the Crown to lead evidence from W in relation to being shown a photo of the “Canberra man”. 
     
      
    28 Some of these matters raise questions under s.219B(1) and (2) of the Customs Act 1901, which provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        219B. Unlawful use of listening devices 
         
        (1) It is unlawful for an official of a Commonwealth law enforcement agency to use, for the purposes of narcotics inquiries that are being made by officials of the agency, a listening device for the purpose of listening to or recording words while they are being spoken by a person unless:  
         
        (a) he is the speaker of the words or is a person, or is included in a class or group of persons, by whom the speaker of the words intends, or should reasonably expect, the words to be heard;  
         
        (b) not being a person permitted to listen to or record the words under paragraph (a), he does so with the consent, express or implied, of such a person; or 
         
        (c) he does so in accordance with a warrant issued to the agency under this Division. 
         
        (2) It is unlawful for a person acting by arrangement with an official of a Commonwealth law enforcement agency to use, for the purposes of narcotics inquiries that are being made by officials of the agency, a listening device for the purpose of listening to or recording words while they are being spoken by a person unless he is the speaker of the words or is a person, or is included in a class or group of persons, by whom the speaker of the words intends, or should reasonably expect, the words to be heard. 
        
       
      
    29 As regards the first and fourth categories referred to by the appellant, the conversations recorded by W fall within s.219B(2), and accordingly their recording was not unlawful, and the evidence was admissible. The relevant telephone intercepts were authorised by warrant, and so fell within s.219B(1)(c).  
     
      
    30 As regards the third category, it was open to the Crown to be selective as to which tapes it put into evidence. All tapes were available to the defence. The appellant has not pointed to any significant inaccuracy in any of the transcripts, and in any event, the trial judge told the jury that the evidence was what was recorded on the tape.  
     
      
    31 As regards the second category, the material found in Reardon’s room was relevant and admissible, and the appellant has not established any basis for thinking otherwise.  
     
      
    32 As regards the final matter, neither the photograph itself nor any description of the person depicted in the photograph was admitted into evidence, so no possible prejudice to the appellant is shown.  
     
      
       
      PERCEIVED BIAS 
      
    33 The appellant submitted that the trial judge should have disqualified himself from conducting the trial, because he had sentenced W in 1992.  
     
      
    34 In my opinion, that could not possibly be a sufficient ground for saying that the trial judge erred in not disqualifying himself on the perception of bias.  
     
      
       
      FAILURE TO DISCHARGE JURY 
      
    35 On the first day of the trial, it came to the trial judge’s attention that one of the jury complained that she did not want to be part of the jury, because of her work situation and the anticipated length of the trial. The appellant submitted that accordingly, it became apparent to the trial judge that the juror was under duress, and may not have fulfilled her duties as an impartial attentive juror. The trial judge should have discharged the jury. The consequent short delay was not a sufficient reason for not doing so. 
     
      
    36 I accept the Crown’s submission that the complaint of the juror was not a proper basis for the juror to be excused, and was not an indication of any reasonable possibility that she might not fulfil her duties. In my opinion, the appellant has not shown there was error in the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion in this matter. 
     
      
       
      ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF POLICE 
      
    37 The appellant submitted that the case was subject to the principles of Ridgeway v. The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19, because no certificate under s.15M of the Crimes Act 1914 had been tendered. He submitted that the police officers, and W, aided, abetted, and induced the commission of offences for which the appellant and the other alleged conspirators were charged. He submitted that it was misconceived to suggest that these persons had no intention to encourage or to be part of a conspiracy. But for pressure from the police, Reardon would not have continued with the matter. Also, the police financed the ongoing operations, and arranged for the provision of $US375,000.00 which was to be used for the purchase of the drugs.  
     
      
    38 The appellant submitted that the NCA was in breach of the UN Convention against drug trafficking; and also acted outside its powers, in that there was no “reference” to conduct this investigation until 6 November 1997.  
     
      
    39 In my opinion, as shown by Yip Chiu-Cheun v The Queen [1995] 1 AC 111, a police agent who agrees with another to traffic in unlawful drugs will be guilty of the offence of conspiracy, even though his motive may be to arrest drug dealers and suppliers. However, the present case is not one where the criminal conduct alleged against the appellant and the other alleged conspirators was “’procured’ by illegal conduct of law enforcement officers”, much less one where “illegal police conduct was itself the principal offence to which the charged offence was ancillary, or creates or itself constitutes an essential ingredient of the charged offence”: see Ridgeway at 39.  
     
      
    40 The alleged conspiracy arose and existed independently of police involvement, and at most the police involvement contributed to some of the acts undertaken in furtherance of the conspiracy. It is not necessary to determine whether that involvement could itself have amounted to criminal conduct, as discussed in Yip Chiu-Cheun. The conduct fell so far short of conduct treated in Ridgeway as being sufficient to justify exclusion of evidence, and a stay of proceedings, that it would not have been a proper exercise of discretion of the trial judge to exclude it.  
     
      
    41 The evidence before us does not establish there was no “reference” for the NCA prior to 6 November 1997.  
     
      
       
      EVIDENCE OF CHILEAN POLICE AND OTHER WITNESSES 
      
    42 The appellant has provided extensive submissions concerning evidence given by Chilean police officers in support of a contention that they gave false, indeed deliberately false, evidence.  
     
      
    43 Some of these submissions concern their written statements. These statements were not used at the trial, except to the extent that they were used in cross-examination by the appellant’s Counsel in an attempt to discredit the witnesses. There is nothing put to this Court in relation to those statements that suggests that the trial in any way miscarried. 
     
      
    44 There are detailed criticisms of various aspects of evidence of the Chilean police and other witnesses. Some of these matters were fully ventilated before the jury, and there is nothing to suggest there was anything unsatisfactory in the way they were dealt with before the jury. Other submissions dealt with matters based on material not before the jury, but this material is not evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of the trial. In any event, in my opinion none of this material is of significance.  
     
      
    45 I think that it is appropriate to address three submissions in particular, because they concern evidence of Mr. Alvarez, who gave the significant evidence referred to in par.[15] above, evidence which the appellant claims to have been concocted. The appellant has submitted a statutory declaration by Reardon to the effect that the visit referred to in that evidence did not occur. For obvious reasons, that evidence of itself would not satisfy the requirement for fresh evidence of pre-trial unavailability, credibility and materiality, but it makes it appropriate to look at the three submissions to which I have referred. 
     
      
    46 First, Mr. Alvarez gave evidence that Chilean police arranged for $US375,000.00 in cash to be put in a safety deposit box. The appellant referred in his submissions to a bank document showing an application to transfer this amount from Sydney to Chile, and a statement by a Mr. McBurnie acting for the NCA in Administrative Appeal Tribunal’s proceedings on 6 June 2001 to the effect that this payment was made, and also to evidence presented to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the occasion of Reardon’s appeal.  
     
      
    47 In circumstances where Mr. Alvarez was not cross-examined on this matter, it is not possible to say that it could have any bearing on his credit. In so far as the appellant seeks to suggest deceit by the NCA, he is relying on evidence led in other cases, which is not properly before this Court. However, in so far as the appellant relies on what occurred in the Reardon appeal, I note that the matter was dealt with in pars.[198] to [200] in the judgment in the Reardon appeal ([2002] NSWCCA 203), and nothing presented in this appeal suggests that this conclusion was incorrect. To the extent that Mr. McBurnie may have suggested otherwise, it would appear that he was mistaken.  
     
      
    48 Second, the appellant pointed to inconsistency between evidence given by Mr. Alvarez and a record made by Mr. Velarde of something said to him by Mr. Alvarez, Mr. Velarde being an interpreter being used by the NCA in their communications with the Chilean police. The appellant complained that Mr. Velarde had not been made available by the Crown as a witness. However, Mr. Velarde’s record of the conversation was in evidence, and was used by the appellant’s Counsel at the trial to attack Mr. Alvarez’s credit. I see no basis therefore for the appellant’s complaint. 
     
      
    49 Third, the appellant submitted that the important evidence referred to in par.[15] above was inconsistent with evidence given by other Chilean police officers.  
     
      
    50 The appellant referred to evidence by Mr. Ibinarriaga, the Chilean police officer in charge of surveillance, to the effect that about twenty people were involved underneath him in the surveillance operation in Chile; yet none of these people, given the task of the surveillance of Reardon or the protection of Mr. Alvarez, saw these two walk to Centra Apartments on 10 October 1997.  
     
      
    51 The appellant also referred to evidence given at Reardon’s trial by Mr. Guitierrez to the effect that between 6 and 10 October he was conducting surveillance on Reardon, for most of the time; but who said nothing about Reardon meeting Mr. Alvarez and going to Centra Apartments. Third, the appellant referred to a written statement by another Chilean officer Mr. Ramos which stated: “On 10 October 1997, Michael Reardon and the undercover police officer “Oscar” met and they walked around the Providencia district. They visited the Brannigans Bar & Grill and other premises in that area”. The appellant submitted that this officer mentions nothing about a visit to Centra Apartments, which was in the opposite direction from Apartment Lota (from which Mr. Alvarez said he left with Reardon to go to Centra Apartments) to Brannigans Bar, and which was some distance from the commercial premises of Providencia. 
     
      
    52 In so far as this relies on material that was not used at the appellant’s trial, it is material that was available to the appellant, and so could not satisfy the test of fresh evidence. In any event, in my opinion this material is not of such weight as to count against Mr. Alvarez’s evidence to an extent that might reasonably have made some difference in the appellant’s trial. 
     
      
       
      FRESH EVIDENCE – NON-DISCLOSURE 
      
    53 The appellant has provided submissions concerning NCA running sheets, which were not available at his trial but have subsequently been made available, and also concerning non-disclosure of the full criminal and psychiatric history of W.  
     
      
    54 As to the latter, we do not have evidence showing matters additional to those disclosed at the hearing that would have impacted significantly on W’s credibility. In any event, his credibility was not important in the case. His only role as a witness in the case was as a participant in recorded conversations.  
     
      
    55 As regards subsequently disclosed running sheets, there has been no material identified which could have been of significance in the appellant’s case.  
     
      
    56 In so far as the running sheets could be used to suggest pressure was being applied on Reardon to proceed with the conspiracy, in my opinion they could not make any difference to the position as discussed above in relation to the application of the Ridgeway principle. In so far as they could have tended to support Reardon’s contention that he was not intending to import drugs but only to “rip off” other participants, in my opinion that is not a matter that could materially have affected the appellant’s trial. 
     
      
       
      UNREASONABLE VERDICT 
      
    57 The appellant submitted that there was no evidence linking or connecting him to Reardon prior to his meeting Reardon in Chile after 10 October 1997; yet it was the Crown case that he conspired with Reardon from early 1997. There was no evidence of any meetings or phone calls, despite the fact that Reardon was heavily monitored and under surveillance from June 1997. The police knew Reardon’s identity, address, phone numbers (home and mobile) and vehicle, and even knew of his meetings with the so-called “Canberra man”, yet there was no evidence, prior to 10 October 1997, as to the identity of this person. The appellant submitted that he was under heavy surveillance from June 1997 in relation to the cannabis offence by the Australian Federal Police, yet there was nothing from that surveillance connecting him to Reardon. The appellant also pointed to long deliberation by the jury, and yet an apparent sudden change of mind by one or more jurors.  
     
      
    58 In my opinion, the evidence to which I have referred at pars.[6] to [16] above was capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was a person involved in the conspiracy to import 50 kilograms of cocaine into Australia. The appellant’s resistance to that inference depended very much on his assertion that he met Reardon by accident on the evening of 13 October 1997. Reardon’s facsimiles referred to in par.[8], and the evidence of Mr. Alvarez referred to in par.[15], amount to powerful evidence that contact between Reardon and the appellant on 13 October 1997 was no coincidence. The subsequent substantial participation by Reardon in relation to the importation of wine arranged by the appellant was further powerful evidence that they had not just met by chance on 13 October 1997. In my opinion, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s participation in the conspiracy.  
     
      
       
      SENTENCE APPEAL 
      
    59 For the reasons given above, in my opinion the appellant’s appeal against conviction on the cocaine charge should be dismissed, and the appeal against sentence on both charges needs to be considered.  
     
      
    60 In her submissions for the appellant, Ms. Mundey submitted that the appellant was sentenced on the cocaine offence on a mistaken premise, namely that the sentences for the other major conspirators were, for Reardon, 18 years imprisonment with a 14 year non-parole period, for Michaels 20 years imprisonment with a 16 year non-parole period, and for Taylor 12 years imprisonment with a 10 year non-parole period; whereas these sentences were subsequently reduced on appeal to respectively 18 years with a 12 year non-parole period, 18 years with a 13 year non-parole period and 12 years with an 8 year non-parole period. Another conspirator, Douglas Crombie, had pleaded guilty; and in respect of him, Shillington DCJ had indicated that, but for his plea and assistance, an appropriate sentence would have been 15 years with a 12 year non-parole period. Ms. Mundey submitted that the appellant’s criminality was no greater than any of these, and arguably was less. He was not a principal organiser, as was Reardon. He did not recruit others to the conspiracy, as did Crombie. He did not threaten a woman to continue her involvement in the conspiracy, as did Reardon. He was not responsible for organising finance, as was Reardon; and he was not responsible for organising the supply of the drug, as were Crombie and Michaels. 
     
      
    61 The appellant had a previous conviction for a similar offence, for which he was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years commencing 30 June 1986; and had a record of summary offences committed in 1983. Michaels also had a previous similar conviction, and was still on parole at the time of this offence. Crombie had less serious drug conviction. Reardon was described as having been a petty criminal, with an old armed robbery conviction, and no drug convictions.  
     
      
    62 Accordingly, Ms. Mundey submitted, the appellant’s head sentence should be no more than 18 years at the most. He had been given a non-parole period of 75%, which was usually reserved for the worst cases. This could not be regarded as such. In particular, the cocaine the subject of the charge had not been acquired, much less imported.  
     
      
    63 As regards the cannabis offence, Ms. Mundey submitted that the co-conspirator had pleaded not-guilty, yet received a much lesser sentence of 12½ years with a 7½ year non-parole period. The co-offender had no previous drug convictions, but did have a substantial criminal record. The appellant had pleaded guilty, and his criminality was no greater than that of the co-offender. Ms. Mundey submitted that the sentencing judge in this case had shown error from the point of view of parity, giving insufficient weight to the plea of guilty, insufficient differentiation between cocaine and cannabis, and had not paid sufficient regard to totality. The sentencing judge accepted that the plea indicated a change in the appellant’s attitude and some remorse; and this conflicted with the view expressed earlier by the sentencing judge that he doubted there were any prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    64 On the question of totality, Ms. Mundey submitted that a 29 year sentence with a 20 year non-parole period for a 48 year old man with a son born in 1997 was “crushing”; and that it did not hold out a proper measure of hope for, or encouragement of, rehabilitation and reform.  
     
      
    65 For the Crown, it was submitted that a higher sentence for the appellant was justified than for Reardon (the appellant had a previous conviction for a similar offence) and Michaels (the appellant was one of the prime movers of the conspiracy). A 75% non-parole period was appropriate, particularly in circumstances where the offence had been committed within about three years of parole served for the prior similar offence. The appellant showed no contrition, and there were no significant subjective features. As regards the Court of Criminal Appeal decision concerning the other conspirators, the sentencing judge had referred to head sentences only of co-offenders, and only Michaels had his head sentence changed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    66 As regards the cannabis offence, the Crown pointed out that this was the appellant’s fourth conviction for importing prohibited imports; and also that the plea was not made at the earliest opportunity.  
     
      
    67 In my opinion, the appellant has not demonstrated error in the sentence for the cocaine offence on the basis of parity, or on the basis of the alteration of sentences of co-conspirators in the previous Court of Criminal Appeal decision. It is possible to justify a higher head sentence for the appellant than for Reardon and Michaels, on the basis put forward by the Crown; and the adjustment of sentences of the co-conspirators by the Court of Criminal Appeal does not significantly impact on questions of parity. The non-parole period might be considered high, but I am unable to identify any particular error of the kind that was identified by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of Reardon and Taylor. I am not satisfied that the overall result is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    68 Turning to the cannabis offence, it would have been preferable for the sentencing judge to have given some indication of his quantification of the allowance made for the plea of guilty, and/or some indication of his starting point. It would appear that the starting point must have been around 17 years, which seems high in comparison with the 12½ year sentence imposed on the co-conspirator in that case, although the appropriate comparison may be with 13 years and 4 months which was considered by the sentencing judge in that case to be the appropriate sentence before some minor deductions personal to that offender. It seems clear that the discrepancy arises from the need identified by the sentencing judge for a significant element of personal deterrence, by reason of the appellant’s other drug offences. However, I would note that this consideration had already produced a head sentence for the cocaine offence about two years longer than it otherwise might have been; and it seems to me that the primary judge may in those circumstances have given too much weight to a need for additional personal deterrence in the sentence for this cannabis offence. 
     
      
    69 In my opinion, the resulting sentence, based on a starting point of 17 years, indicates to me that the primary judge did err, either in giving too much weight to personal deterrence, or in having too little regard to parity, or having too little regard to the mitigating effect of the plea of guilty and expression of contrition. In my opinion, the appropriate starting point would have been around 14 years, and with the discount for the plea of guilty and contrition, an appropriate sentence would be 12 years. 
     
      
    70 The 12 years should start at the end of the non-parole period of the cocaine offence, giving a total of 27 years. In my opinion, the total non-parole period should then be 18 years.  
     
      
       
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    71 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentences granted. 
       
      3. Appeal against sentence for the cocaine offence dismissed.  
       
      4. Appeal against sentence for the cannabis offence allowed, sentence set aside, and in lieu thereof there be a sentence of imprisonment for 12 years commencing 21 November 2012, and that there be a total non-parole period of 18 years commencing 21 November 1997. 
       
      
    72 The effect of the sentence is that the appellant could expect to be released on parole on 21 November 2015, subject to good behaviour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal against conviction following trial before Nicholson DCJ and a jury upon counts of aggravated dangerous driving causing death and aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s 52A(2) and 52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    2 The ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “There has been a miscarriage of justice in that evidence was received by the jury that should have been excluded”. 
        
       
      
    3 The argument in support of the ground is that an admission, having regard to the circumstances in which it was made, was such as to render it unfair to the appellant to use the evidence. Reliance is placed upon the discretion vested in the trial judge pursuant to s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995. No objection to the particular evidence was taken at trial and no call was made upon the learned trial judge to either consider or exercise that discretion. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. 
     
      
    4 It is however a convenient method of considering the issue raised notionally to examine an application to exclude the evidence in accordance with s 90. In addition, this Court is in a position to observe the use that was in fact made of the now disputed evidence. The appellant was driving a Ford Falcon sedan west on the M4 motorway at St Clair. Her de facto partner John Bastow occupied the front passenger’s seat and three children were in the rear seat. Witnesses saw the car fishtail and overturn. Mr Bastow died and one of the children suffered injuries which amounted to grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    5 Prior to the incident a witness (in a vehicle overtaken by the appellant’s car) estimated its speed at faster than 110 kilometres per hour. The time was about 7 pm. The appellant was conveyed to hospital. A blood sample was taken shortly after 8 pm and was analysed to contain 0.194 grams of alcohol per 100 mls of blood. There was expert evidence that, at the time of impact her blood alcohol content would have been no less than 0.15 grams per 100 ml of blood. This circumstance elevated the offences into the aggravated forms. 
     
      
    6 At Nepean District Hospital a Constable Moir, a highway patrol officer, approached the appellant. He specifically told her that he was seeking details of all people involved in the accident. The appellant produced her driver’s licence. There was discussion about change of address from that indicated on the licence. Constable Moir asked whether the appellant could remember anything about the accident and she answered in the negative. She described, however, some memories she did have. During the discussion the appellant was seen to take some substance from a bottle with a medical dropper and a nurse took it away. In resumed conversation the appellant stated that she could not remember whether she was driving the car. After the blood sample was taken the appellant asked the constable about Mr Bastow. He told her that unfortunately he had passed away as a result of the accident. She asked him where his body would be taken and he told her. 
     
      
    7 The appellant then raised a subject with Constable Moir saying, “Will I get charged for driving?” And he replied, “I cannot answer that as this matter is under investigation by crash investigation officers”. He added, “Have you got a contact number that you can be contacted on?” The appellant replied in the affirmative and supplied a number. She then said, “Can you see if my mobile phone is in the car? I need that to get a phone number to call the kid’s father to tell him what’s happened. He might then come here and finish what I tried to do, kill myself”. 
     
      
    8 Afterwards Constable Moir left the hospital. He entered his recollection of the conversation into a word processor about forty minutes after that departure. It is the final remark above quoted upon which the ground of appeal is focussed. 
     
      
    9 Trial counsel (who did not appear in the appeal) cross examined Constable Moir to suggest, relevantly, what the appellant said was “He might come here and kill me himself.” Constable Moir did not agree with that proposition. The appellant in her evidence denied saying the words attributed to her by Constable Moir and testified that she said words to the effect, “My ex husband will come and kill me himself”. She explained that she “desperately” wanted to telephone the boy’s father because the seriously injured lad was being transferred to Westmead Hospital while she expected that she might have to remain at Nepean District Hospital. 
     
      
    10 The evidence of the essential ingredients of the charges was overwhelming and was not the subject of serious challenge, save that the appellant denied that she had control of the car at the critical time because Mr Bastow had seized the steering wheel. Accordingly, she argued that she was not the driver of the vehicle. The Crown called evidence of earlier assertions by the appellant to this effect including a conversation with one of the children and she testified herself to the circumstance. She also relied upon the statutory defence (in respect of which the onus lay on her) that the death or harm was not in any way attributable to the fact that she was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  
     
      
    11 The final addresses of counsel have been transcribed and it is plain that the disputed remark to Senior Constable Moir was relied upon by the Crown in the context of meeting the challenge to proof that, at the relevant time, the appellant was indeed the driver of the car. Specifically the Crown Prosecutor said that the jury would have conveyed to it that she was blaming herself and not Mr Bastow for the accident. It is apparent that the issue of whether the Crown had proved the appellant was the driver of the car at the relevant time was the principal matter of contest at trial. The reliance by the appellant on the possible defence vested by s52A(8) essentially involved the same evidence.  
     
      
    12 It was not the Crown case that the impact was the result of any attempt by the appellant to kill herself. The Crown submitted that the remark now contended to have required exclusion was a relevant comment among a number of escalating versions given by the appellant concerning the alleged actions of Mr Bastow and the causative effect they might have had in bringing about the impact. In the sense of who was controlling the car, the issue was the identity of the driver. 
     
      
    13 The jury had available for consideration evidence of the following sequence of utterances by the appellant.  
     
      
    14 At the scene she stated to one person (David Williams) that, “The man in the car reached to get a cigarette and grabbed the wheel”. To another (Brendan McEntee) that, “He wanted a cigarette and I would not give him one so he shook the wheel”. At hospital she told Constable Moir when asked if she was driving that, “I can’t remember. I think so, or was it John?” Thereafter she made the comment now in issue. Later she acknowledged to a Constable Bain that she was the driver (occupying the relevant portion of the car) but said, “I am pretty sure that he was grabbing at the wheel because the car was going zoom, zoom”. This was accompanied by a gesture describing movement from side to side. The day after the incident, the appellant told a Ms Reid that she was unable to control the car and Mr Bastow tried unsuccessfully to help her regain control.  
     
      
    15 Thus the essential question becomes whether it was unfair not to exclude the comment made to Constable Moir in that sequence.  
     
      
    16 Section 90 of the Evidence Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    17 Counsel for the appellant has tabulated the circumstances upon which reliance is placed as relevant to unfairness in admitting the evidence. They are, first, that the appellant was: 
     
      
       
      (a) drunk 
       
      (b) in shock 
       
      (c) at a hospital 
       
      (d) had just been in a serious car accident that featured the car rolling end over end a number of times 
       
      (e) was aware that her child was very badly injured, and 
       
      (f) had been told moments before that her partner was dead. 
       
      
    18 Second, that Constable Moir: 
     
      
       
      (a) did not caution the appellant at any stage, even though he must have suspected her of a serious driving offence 
       
      (b) did not take steps to corroborate the admission by way of having another officer with him 
       
      (c) did not take steps to record admission in any way, either by a hand held recorder or by a notebook or any other document 
       
       
      (d) did not take steps to have the appellant adopt a record of the admission  
       
      (e) did not cause the admission to be put to the appellant in the later interview on the same evening. 
       
      
    19 Before dealing with these explicit matters, it is apt to consider the notion of unfairness encapsulated in s 90. Although the issue did not relate directly to that statutory provision, there is useful guidance to be extracted from observations in The Queen v Swaffield and Pavic 1998 192 CLR 159. As noted by Brennan CJ (@ p 171) it was a discretionary category of exclusion which arose after the rule against admission of involuntary admissions was established which came to be known as the discretion to exclude for “unfairness”. The joint judgment (Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ) having noted that “unfairness” necessarily lacks precision and involves evaluation of circumstances, inter alia, adverted to s 90 as an exemplar (@ 193-194): 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been said, rightly, that fairness is a vague concept. It has also been said that the application of the unfairness discretion is uncertain because courts have failed to define the policy behind the discretion or considerations relevant to it. This, it is argued, makes satisfactory appellate review of the discretion difficult. The criticism has force though the very nature of the concept inhibits great precision. An approach to unfairness which focuses on whether reception of the evidence in question may have jeopardised the accused’s right to a fair trial because the statement was obtained in circumstances affecting its reliability does admit of application by a trial judge and review on appeal. However, the unfairness discretion would achieve nothing beyond what is already required by the general law if it were concerned solely to ensure a fair trial. 
        
       
       
        
        The concept of unfairness has been expressed in the widest possible form in the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). Section 90 of both Acts reads: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Neither in s 90 nor anywhere else in either Act is there to be found a definition of unfairness. Part 3.11 – ‘Discretions to Exclude Evidence’ contains a number of provisions of a general nature empowering the court to refuse to admit evidence or to limit its use. In particular s 138(1) prohibits the admission of evidence obtained 
        
       
       
        
        ‘(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law; 
        
       
       
        
        ….. unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained’. 
        
       
       
        
        This expresses in the widest terms the policy discretion developed by the common law. It is true that an approach, expressed in such terms, lacks certainty. But as the Law Reform Commission of Canada has said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘there is an undeniable advantage in granting judges discretionary power, since it keeps the courts continually in touch with current social attitudes and may lead to the eventual evolution of the rules as the courts adapt them to changing social realities’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 So far as the conduct of Constable Moir is concerned, in the present case, there was nothing in the nature of misrepresentation, trickery or the like which led to the appellant’s statement. He had told her that others were investigating the matter and he was seeking particulars appropriate to his status as a highway patrol officer. A reading of the context shows that the appellant’s statement was volunteered as an entirely unresponsive utterance to a request by him to advise if she could be contacted by telephone. No conduct of Constable Moir could reasonably be regarded as unfair or to have contributed to any notion of unfairness relating to the making of the statement by the appellant. 
     
      
    21 I turn to the tabulated matters advanced by counsel. 
     
      
    22 That the appellant was drunk, in shock and had been in a serious car accident were all factors equally applicable at the time that she spoke to Mr Williams and Mr McEntee. What was said to them was relied upon by her to support argument that she may not have been the driver. It would create something of a paradox if those statements were admitted in her favour but, in the very same circumstances, what she said to Constable Moir was rejected as unfair. 
     
      
    23 The appellant was, at the time she spoke to him, at hospital, was aware of serious injury to her child and that her partner was deceased. What was being sought was a contact telephone number and it might be inferred from that that the appellant’s situation did not manifest a likelihood that she would be retained there. Her knowledge about her son and her partner would, no doubt, have contributed to her emotional state but, with the advantage of hindsight and in the context of all of the evidence, there is little, if anything, to suggest that her statement might be unreliable. Unreliability is not synonymous with unfairness but it is a relevant indicator of whether admission of particular testimony might be unfair. I am unpersuaded that his Honour’s non-intervention to reject the evidence was unfair. 
     
      
    24 Neither do the specific complaints tabulated concerning Constable Moir so demonstrate. He had specifically told the appellant that he was not concerned with potential charging and there was no cause for him to administer a caution:cf R v Dutton (unrep) NSWCCA 7 Dec 1990. There was no reason for him to bring equipment to make a recording or to have a corroborating witness present given the extent of the enquiries which he was directing. It was the appellant who, absent any inspiration emanating from the constable, made the statement now asserted to be so damaging that it should have been rejected as unfair. See Foster v The Queen 1993 113 ALR 1. 
     
      
    25 The final complaint that the admission was not put to the appellant by investigators later that evening recognizes that Constable Moir was not conducting the investigation or the interview. There is no evidence that he was aware that the interview was taking place or that the interviewers at that time knew what the appellant had said to Constable Moir. 
     
      
    26 An evaluation of all of the circumstances does not lead to a conclusion that the admission of the evidence was unfair. 
     
      
    27 I have recorded that there was no objection taken at trial. An affidavit by counsel who appeared has been received. It would divert attention from the essential issue to seek now to analyse whether his reasons for not objecting were correct or not. Those reasons become irrelevant if it is determined that there was no miscarriage of his Honour’s discretion and therefore no miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    28 As observed, the challenge is made against a discretionary matter although, of course, in the absence of objection, the learned trial judge was not asked to exercise one. A question arose during the appeal as to whether it would be sufficient for the appellant to show that there was a reasonable possibility that the evidence would have been excluded if the objection had been taken or whether the appellant must show that it would have been excluded. 
     
      
    29 The question was addressed by counsel for the appellant by acknowledging that if the objection had been taken at trial and overruled, the appellant would need to establish error in order to attract intervention by this Court and, quite properly, conceded that the appellant cannot seek to be in a better position when no objection was taken. 
     
      
    30 It follows that the appellant would be required to show that, if the objection had been taken at trial, the evidence would have been excluded. 
     
      
    31 The matters raised do not fulfil that requirement. 
     
      
    32 I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    33 DOWD J: I have read the judgment of Grove J in draft form. I agree with the proposed order and reasons therefore. 
     
      
    34 I have also read the additional observations of Sperling J in his draft judgment. I agree with those additional observations. 
     
      
    35 SPERLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J and with his reasons. I wish to add the following observations of my own. 
     
      
    36 I refer with gratitude to Grove J’s judgment for the trial background of this appeal and the way the appeal was presented. 
     
      
    37 The case for the Crown was as follows. The appellant was driving the vehicle. Her front-seat passenger was Mr J Bastow. There were three children sitting on the rear seat. The car was seen by other drivers to commence to fish-tail, veer sharply to the right, collide with an embankment which formed a median strip in the centre of the road-way, and roll end over end several times. Mr Bastow was killed and one of the children suffered serious injury. The appellant had well over the prescribed concentration of alcohol in her blood at the time of the collision. 
     
      
    38 The appellant’s case at the trial was that she was not in control of the vehicle at the time and therefore not the “driver” of the vehicle; and that, if it was found that she was the driver, the alcohol had not contributed to the casualty.  
     
      
    39 In both respects, the same issue of fact was proffered by the appellant. Her evidence was to the following effect: she was driving, there was an exchange with Mr Bastow over whether he could smoke in the car, the steering-wheel suddenly went to the left and she saw that his left hand was on the wheel, she corrected the wheel, the wheel was pulled to the left again, she tried to correct again, the car was then spinning and tumbling. 
     
      
    40 Some support was given to the appellant’s version of events through the evidence of Senior Constable Moir who said that, at the scene of the accident, he heard one of the children say to the appellant, “Mummy, John was trying to lean over and drive the car. We then had a crash”, to which he heard the appellant say “Yes, sweetie, that’s right”. 
     
      
    41 In addition to evidence of eyewitnesses concerning the accident itself, evidence was led in the Crown case, of conversations between the appellant and others, including the police, occurring shortly after the accident. The conversations, as given in evidence were as follows. 
     
      
    42 Immediately after the event, the appellant spoke to two persons who had witnessed the accident. According to Mr D Williams, the appellant told him that her passenger reached to get a cigarette and grabbed the wheel.  
     
      
    43 The other person who witnessed the accident was Mr B McEntee. He said that the appellant told him that her passenger wanted a cigarette, that she would not give him one, so he shook the wheel. 
     
      
    44 Senior Constable Moir attended the scene of the accident. He asked her if she was driving the car. She said, “I can’t remember. I think so, or was it John?” Later in the conversation, the appellant said she needed to telephone the children’s father to tell him what had happened and that “he might then come here and finish what I tried to do, kill myself”. (The evidence of this statement by the appellant gives rise to the appeal.) 
     
      
    45 The accident was investigated by Senior Constable Bain. He spoke to the appellant at the hospital soon after the accident. According to him, the appellant acknowledged that she was the driver. Asked if she remembered what had happened, she first said “Not really” and then went on to say “I’m pretty sure that he [Mr Bastow] was grabbing at the wheel because the car was going zoom, zoom”, indicating left and right with her hands. She went on to say that she and Mr Bastow were arguing over cigarettes. (This was relied on by the Crown as evidence that Mr Bastow took hold of the wheel, if he did , only after the car went out of control.)46 On the day following the accident, the appellant spoke to Ms Reid. According to her, the appellant said that she was driving, that she was unable to control the car, so Mr Bastow lent over and helped her to do so, but the two of them were unable to control it together, and that she believed, or that someone had advised her on the site, that the steering-arm had broken. (That was consistent with the implication which the Crown said arose from the statement to Senior Constable Bain.) 
     
      
    47 In his address to the jury, the Crown prosecutor referred to this body of evidence in some detail, pointing out the inconsistencies between the various versions given by the plaintiff shortly after the accident and the inconsistencies with the plaintiff’s account given in evidence by her. He invited the jury to reject the appellant’s evidence of interference by Mr Bastow altogether. He also submitted that, if Mr Bastow did take hold of the wheel, that occurred after the car went out of control or the appellant remained sufficiently in control of the vehicle to continue to be the “driver”. He further submitted that the jury would not be satisfied that the alcohol had not contributed to the accident in any event.  
     
      
    48 With regard to the statement to Senior Constable Moir, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the appellant was blaming herself and thereby implying that she was in control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. It was not suggested that her statement to Senior Constable Moir should be taken literally, to the effect that the appellant was endeavouring to commit suicide. The Crown prosecutor put no more emphasis on the evidence of this statement by the appellant than on the evidence of other statements made by her shortly after the accident. 
     
      
    49 In his address to the jury, counsel for the appellant dealt with this body of evidence by arguing that the accounts of the conversations given by the various witnesses were, for various reasons, unreliable and that, if the accounts were correct, the statements by the appellant were made by her when she was upset and ought not accordingly to be held against her. The statement to Senior Constable Moir which is the subject of this appeal was dealt with in that way, along with the others. 
     
      
    50 In his summing up, the trial judge gave general directions concerning the assessment of witnesses by the jury. He did not review the evidence of statements made by the appellant to the various witnesses shortly after the event nor the arguments which had been advanced in relation to that evidence. His Honour was not asked to supplement his summing up in that regard either by the Crown or by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    51 It is apparent from the course of the trial (including the evidence, the addresses and the summing up) that the statement by the appellant to Senior Constable Moir, which is the subject of this appeal, was not a major feature of the trial. It was one of several statements relied on by the Crown as evidence of inconsistency in accounts of the accident given by the appellant shortly after the event and of inconsistency between such accounts and the account of the accident given by the appellant in her evidence. The conversation with Ms Reid, on the day following the accident, was far more damaging to the appellant than her statement to Senior Constable Moir. No special significance was attributed to the evidence of the statement to Senior Constable Moir by counsel or by the trial judge, relative to other accounts in that body of evidence. 
     
      
    52 There having been no objection to the evidence, there is no question of error on the part of the trial judge. In these circumstances, to succeed in the appeal, the appellant must demonstrate a miscarriage of justice: Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1) and Papakosmas (1999) 196 CLR 297, per McHugh J at [319]. 
     
      
    53 The appellant invokes s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995. That section invests the trial judge, in criminal proceedings, with a discretion to exclude evidence of an admission by the accused if, having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to the accused for the evidence to be used. 
     
      
    54 No application was made to the trial judge to exclude the evidence pursuant to s 90. In these circumstances, what holding must the appellant obtain from this court in order to establish a miscarriage of justice? According to the appellant, the necessary holding is that, if the point had been taken, the evidence should have been excluded or, to put it another way, that a refusal to exclude the evidence would have been manifestly wrong. According to the Crown, the necessary holding is that a proper exercise of discretion would require the evidence to be excluded. There is no material difference between these two formulations. They amount to a common position that this court must be satisfied that the trial judge could not reasonably have refused to exclude the evidence if the objection had been taken.55 Insofar as the relevant statement was made by the appellant when she was distressed, that was a factor which the jury was well able to assess and evaluate in weighing the evidence of statements made by the appellant shortly after the accident. The appellant‘s intoxicated state is also relied upon in the appeal as a further reason for it being unfair to the appellant for the evidence to be used against her. That also was a factor which the jury was well able to take into account. 
     
      
    56 In view of this consideration and the considerations mentioned by Grove J bearing upon this question, it has not been established to my satisfaction that the trial judge could not reasonably have refused to exclude the evidence of the statement to Senior Constable Moir if the objection had been taken at trial. 
     
      
    57 Furthermore, the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules stand in the way of this appeal. Even assuming, in favour of the appellant, that, if objection had been taken, the evidence would necessarily have been excluded, there was no miscarriage of justice. The evidence was of relatively minor significance in the context of the evidence of other statements made by the appellant shortly after the accident and in the context of the evidence as a whole. It cannot be said that the appellant lost a chance of acquittal by reason of the evidence of this statement having been placed before the jury. For that reason also, there was no miscarriage of justice.

     Regina v Stephen Bonat 
      
      
     Judgment No.2 
     
     
      
    1 Sperling J: On 5 June 2003 Norrish DCJ imposed sentences on the appellant, the effective sentence being for seven years and six months with a non-parole period of four years to date from 7 March 2003 and expiring on 6 March 2007. 
     
      
    2 The court has, this day, allowed an appeal against the convictions in respect of which the sentences were imposed and has directed the entry of verdicts of acquittal in lieu thereof (R v Bonat [2004] NSWCCA 240). 
     
      
    3 The court which heard and determined the appeal was constituted by Sheller JA, Adams J and myself. 
     
      
    4 The court is now informed that, on 10 October 2003, Shadbolt DCJ imposed a sentence on the appellant in relation to another matter consisting of a one year non-parole period, commencing on 6 March 2007 and expiring on 5 March 2008 and a three year parole period expiring on 5 March 2011. As is apparent, that sentence was dated to commence on the expiration of the effective non-parole period under the sentences imposed by Norrish DCJ. 
     
      
    5 Application is made on behalf of the appellant for an order pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides, so far as is material, that a court which quashes a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a person may vary the date of commencement of any other sentence that has been imposed on that person. 
     
      
    6 The order sought is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        That the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Shadbolt on 10 October 2003 consisting of a 1 year non-parole period commencing 6 March 2007 and expiring on 5 March 2008 and a 3 year parole period expiring on 5 March 2011 be varied, pursuant to section 59 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 so that the sentence commences on 7 March 2003, the non-parole period expires on 6 March 2004 and the total sentence expires on 6 March 2007. 
        
       
      
    7 The effect of this order would be to backdate the sentence imposed by Shadbolt DCJ to commence on the date of commencement of sentences (now quashed) imposed by Norrish DCJ. The non-parole period under the sentence imposed by Shadbolt J would then have expired on 6 March 2004 and would accordingly have been served. 
     
      
    8 The Crown does not object to the order being made. 
     
      
    9 I have conferred with Sheller JA and Adams J. We are in agreement that the order should be made. Accordingly, the order of the court is as sought.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 25 March 2003, before his Honour Judge Knight, the appellant pleaded not guilty to three charges: 
     
      
      (1) That he between 1 January 1983 and 18 November 1984 at Towamba in the State of New South Wales did assault SK and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon SK she being under the age of sixteen years. 
       
      (2) That he between 1 January 1983 and 18 November 1984 at Towamba in the State of New South Wales did assault SK and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon SK she being under the age of sixteen years. 
       
      (3) That he between 1 November 1984 and 19 November 1984 at Towamba in the State of New South Wales did assault SK thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm. 
       
      
    2 On 3 April 2003, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on counts 1 and 3, and not guilty on count 2. 
     
      
    3 On 8 May 2003, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of two years, but he suspended execution of this sentence conditionally on the appellant entering into a good behaviour bond for two years. 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals from his conviction on count 1.  
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    5 Before referring to the evidence for the Crown and the appellant, it is convenient to set out certain matters of background that are not the subject of substantial dispute. 
     
      
    6 The complainant was born on 8 March 1975. Her mother commenced to live with the appellant in 1980. Until January 1984, the complainant's mother had custody of the complainant and her brother T (born in 1976), with some access by their father. 
     
      
    7 The complainant's mother and the appellant had a child J born 8 August 1982, and another child W born 18 October 1984. 
     
      
    8 Between about August 1983 and about December 1983, the appellant and the complainant's mother built a house on a property at Log Farm Road, Towamba, which became known as ""R & R Ranch"". The family moved there in about mid-December 1983. 
     
      
    9 In January 1984, the complainant and T went for an access visit to their father, after which they were not returned to their mother. 
     
      
    10 In March 1984, interim orders were made by the Family Court, with the result that the complainant and T remained with their father, but spent at least some weekends and Wednesdays with their mother and the appellant at R & R Ranch. This continued until July 1984, when there was a court hearing, which returned the complainant and T to the custody of their mother. From July 1984, the complainant and T again were living at R & R Ranch. 
     
      
    11 In November 1984 (the month after the birth of the complainant's half-brother W), there was an incident when the appellant struck the complainant with a whip. This was the subject of count 3. The complainant complained about this incident to her father and to a GP, Dr.A; and she was interviewed about it by a DOCS officer on 23 November 1984. The appellant admitted this incident, and defended the charge substantially on the basis that it was lawful chastisement. 
     
      
    12 The complainant left the R & R Ranch in 1987. She did not complain to anyone about the indecent assaults until the year 2000. 
     
      
    13 The complainant gave the following evidence concerning the two alleged indecent assaults. 
     
      
    14 The first count related to an incident in the lounge room at R & R Ranch, when only the complainant, the appellant and J were in the house. According to the complainant, J was not quite one year old at the time. The complainant was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. 
     
      
    15 According to the complainant, the appellant said to her ""Come here"", and that he had something to show her again. He exposed his penis, grabbed her hand, and made her rub his penis until it achieved an erect state. He placed his hand on her shorts on the area of her vagina, and said ""One day this will go there"". 
     
      
    16 The complainant said that she did not tell her mother about this because, she said, her mother had not believed her on a previous occasion. The complainant said that, some months earlier, the appellant had shown her his penis; the complainant told her mother about this; and her mother then asked the appellant about it and the appellant denied the allegations. The complainant's mother apparently accepted this denial. This incident was apparently what was referred to by the word ""again"" used at the time of the lounge room incident. 
     
      
    17 Count 2 concerned an incident near what was said to be a water pump on the R & R Ranch property. According to the complainant, a couple of months after the lounge room incident, the appellant took her to an area near a water pump. He unzipped his pants, removed his penis and made her rub her hand up and down the penis. 
     
      
    18 The complainant said that she told no-one about either incident, because she was scared that the appellant would hurt her or someone in the family.  
     
      
    19 The appellant denied both incidents and also the alleged exposure of his penis on the earlier occasion. The complainant's mother denied that the complainant had ever complained to her about the appellant exposing his penis. The complainant's mother also said that there was never any occasion when she went anywhere and left J and the complainant at home with the appellant. 
     
      
    20 Both the appellant and the complainant's mother gave evidence that the appellant never went to the pump on the property with the complainant alone; and there was also evidence to the effect that the pump on the property was quite different from that described by the complainant, and that it could be seen from the house, contrary to the complainant's evidence. 
     
      
    21 After the jury had retired to consider its verdict, it raised the following question: 
     
      
       
        
        In respect of charges (1) and (2) the wording of the indictment is that the offences were committed at Towamba. In evidence the Crown asserted the offences took place at very specific places. To arrive at a verdict, do the jury have to accept that the offences happened at the specific locations stated in evidence or may the jury consider the term Towamba as used in the indictment? 
        
       
      
    22 The trial judge answered the question, by saying inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        In order the convict the accused of the first one you would need to be satisfied that the offence occurred at that place, that is in the lounge room on the house on the R & R Ranch at Log Farm Road, Towamba. In relation to the second offence you would need to be satisfied that the offence occurred on the property, the R & R Ranch at Log Farm Road, Towamba outside, not in the house, and near where there was a pump on that property. 
        
       
       
       
      GROUND OF APPEAL 
      
    23 The appellant relies on a single ground: 
     
      
       
        
        The verdict of guilty on the first count is unreasonable and cannot be reconciled with the verdict of not guilty on the second count.  
        
       
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    24 Mr. Cook for the appellant submitted that the Crown case on counts 1 and 2 depended entirely on the evidence of the complainant, and that this evidence was so weak and unreliable that it was unreasonable for the jury to have convicted on either count. 
     
      
    25 He submitted further that the differing verdicts between the two counts could not reasonably be explained in terms of any distinction in the quality of the evidence, there being the same defects in each case. 
     
      
    26 An important weakness in relation to both counts, he submitted, concerned the complainant's evidence as to the time when they occurred. In a statement to the police, it was implicit that the episodes occurred in 1985 or 1986. However, in her evidence at the trial, she said they occurred between April and August 1983, before J's first birthday (8 August 1983), when she was in third class at school (this being 1983) and long before W was born (October 1984). However, there was very strong evidence that the family had not moved to the R & R Ranch until about mid-December 1983, that the house was not completed even then, and that the complainant was not at the house between a time in January 1984, when she went to her father for an access visit, and March 1984, when she began to spend weekends and Wednesdays at the house. Although it was possible to reconcile these matters by supposing that the incidents occurred in the period following March 1984, there was a very big difference between J being twelve months or less and being nearly two years old, and by 1984 the complainant would no longer have been in third class at school. Also, the events would not readily then have been described as occurring ""long before"" W's birth in October 1984. 
     
      
    27 Mr. Cook submitted that, another significant defect in the complainant's evidence was that, despite numerous opportunities, the complainant did not disclose any alleged indecent conduct by the appellant for a period of over seventeen years. She told her father about the whipping incident, and also told a GP, this being at a time when her parents were engaged in Family Law proceedings. Similarly, there was no reference to these matters when the complainant was interviewed by a social worker in 1984.  
     
      
    28 He submitted that there was powerful evidence that the complainant's evidence concerning the circumstances of the pump incident could not have been correct. The complainant gave evidence of the event occurring near an old rusty pump, of the order of about one metre high, near a creek, at a point where there was no visibility from the house. There was that kind of pump on her father's property, but there was strong evidence that the only pump on the R & R Ranch was a new pump, no more than about 40 centimetres high, near a dam and not near a creek, and fully visible from the house. In so far as it was suggested that this may discredit the complainant's evidence only as to the location of the assault, and not its occurrence, Mr. Cook pointed out that it was integral to the complainant's account of the assault that it occurred on the occasion of a trip to the pump. 
     
      
    29 In relation to the first count, he submitted, although there was no opportunity to falsify the complainant's description of the lounge room, it was significant that, in the only respect in which the complainant's account could be challenged by anyone apart from the appellant, the complainant's mother denied that the complainant had told her about a previous incident of exposure, which was presumably what was referred to by the word ""again"" mentioned in the complainant's account of the lounge room incident. 
     
      
    30 Mr. Cook submitted that this was not a case in which the evidence supporting the first count was materially different from that supporting the second count; and the evidence displayed discrepancies and inadequacies such as would cause this court to conclude that there is a significant possibility that the appellant has been wrongly convicted: see MFA v. The Queen (2002) 77 ALJR 139. 
     
      
    31 The Crown submitted that this was a jury decision, in a case where the jury had seen and heard the evidence of the complainant, the appellant, and the complainant's mother. The primary judge had given appropriate directions in relation to all the difficulties in the Crown case adverted to by the appellant's Counsel. The jury had nevertheless been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the first count. 
     
      
    32 The Crown submitted that the complainant gave a reasonable explanation for not complaining about the indecent assaults; and the complaint concerning the whipping incident was not made at the initiative of the complainant, but rather as a result of bruising observed by her father on a period of access. 
     
      
    33 As regards the time discrepancies, the Crown submitted that the incidents could have occurred in March 1984 and following months, and that errors as to the precise class in primary school in which the complainant then was, the precise age of J, and the precise time before the birth of W, could reasonably have been considered by the jury not to be errors substantially damaging to the credibility and reliability of the complainant's evidence. The time discrepancies were fairly put to the jury by the trial judge. 
     
      
    34 As regards alleged inconsistency, the Crown submitted that the question was whether there was a proper way by which the appellate court could reconcile the verdicts, consistently with the jury performing its functions as required: MacKenzie v. The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366-7, Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 453-5, R v. Markuleski (2001) 125 A Crim R 1 at [6], [8] and [102]. Particularly in the light of the jury's question, the verdict of not guilty on the second count might merely have reflected the jury's view that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an indecent assault occurring near the pump on the R & R Ranch: see MFA at [34]; R v. Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593; R v. Nek  NSWCCA 392 at [28] and [32]. The jury was properly directed as to the regard they might have in relation to doubts they had on the evidence in relation to one count, and how that could be applied in relation to their consideration of the other count. 
     
      
       
      DECISION 
      
    35 I accept that there are matters which could have caused the jury to have a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the complainant's evidence, in addition to the appellant's sworn denials: in particular, the failure to complain for over seventeen years; inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the timing of the events; probable errors in the description of the physical circumstances of count 2; contradiction by the complainant's mother concerning a complaint about an earlier incident of exposure; and non-acceptance of the complainant's evidence on count 2. 
     
      
    36 However, the complainant's explanation of her failure to complain was credible, and appropriate directions were given concerning it. 
     
      
    37 As regards the timing issues, it seems probable that the incidents, if they occurred, occurred in the period commencing March 1984 when the complainant returned to the R & R Ranch, at first for access weekends and Wednesdays and subsequently permanently. This does involve the evidence being mistaken as to the age of J at the time, and the precise class in primary school that the complainant was then in, but these errors are not in my opinion such as to make the complainant's evidence not believable. Again, appropriate directions were given by the primary judge. 
     
      
    38 As regards the probable errors concerning the description of the circumstances of the pump incident, these were not errors necessarily suggesting fabrication, or even unreliability of the complainant's evidence. They could be regarded as understandable errors concerning the precise circumstances of an incident, which in the view of the jury gave rise to a reasonable doubt whether there was an incident that fell appropriately within the terms of the charge. That this could well have been the jury's view is suggested by the terms of the question that they asked of the trial judge. 
     
      
    39 The jury's verdict on the second count does not show that jury accepted all of the evidence of the complainant's mother. On the contrary, the jury clearly rejected that evidence in relation to the question of whether the complainant was ever left in the house together with the appellant and J, as demonstrated by their finding of guilty on count 1. 
     
      
    40 For those reasons, in my opinion the appellant has not shown that there was unreasonableness or inconsistency such as to justify the setting aside of the jury verdict. As put by the Crown, the difficulties were fairly before the jury, the jury had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the evidence of the principal witnesses, and the decision was one which was open to the jury to make. 
     
      
    41 For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    42 SHAW J: I agree with the reasons of Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    43 SMART AJ: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    2 HODGSON JA: On 7 November 2003, Karpin DCJ gave judgment in the sum of $322,501.92 in favour of the respondent in motor accident proceedings brought by the respondent against the appellant, and made costs orders generally in favour of the respondent. The appellant appeals from that decision. 
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    3 The proceedings arose out of a motor accident which occurred at about 9.30pm on 18 May 1999.  
     
      
    4 The respondent was walking in a northerly direction in Lakeview Drive, Terrigal, proceeding from Ocean View Drive towards the intersection with Minell Close. The road at this point was not kerbed and guttered, and there was no formed footpath: grass extended from house frontages to a gravel verge, and then there was a bitumen roadway about 8 metres wide. The respondent was walking either on his right side of the road, or on the grass or gravel verge on that side of the road. The appellant was driving in a southerly direction on the same stretch of road, initially at about 50-60kph. Her vehicle struck the respondent causing him substantial injuries. 
     
      
    5 As stated by the primary judge, the central issue at the trial was the position of the respondent at the time of the impact. The respondent said that he was not on the bitumen roadway; and the appellant said that he was. 6 Evidence concerning the circumstances of the accident was given by the respondent, the appellant, a passenger in the appellant’s car (Mr. Dybing), the driver of another car (Mrs. Hurst), and two police officers who attended after the accident (Senior Constable King and Probationary Constable Collins).  
     
      
    7 The respondent, the appellant, Mrs. Hurst and the two police officers identified three vehicles present at the time of the accident: the appellant’s vehicle, Mrs. Hurst’s vehicle being driven in Lakeview Drive in the opposite direction, and a white van parked on the east side of Lakeview Drive, that is, the same side as that on which the respondent was walking. 
     
      
    8 None of these witnesses placed the white van to the south of the point of impact. Both the respondent and Mrs. Hurst identified its position as being next to a section of road which was kerbed and guttered (see Black 23 OQ, Black 106S-107Q, and Blue 349), well to the north of the point of impact. The police officers placed the van 40 metres north from the start of the skid marks on the road. The appellant’s evidence was to the effect that she passed the van and saw the respondent “stumble out onto the road in front of me”. 
     
      
    9 The two police officers observed skid marks that they said were on the bitumen road, about 10 metres long, and they observed some debris about half-way along these skid marks, at a point where the easterly skid mark was about one and a half metres in from the edge of the bitumen. They identified this as the point of impact. The general direction of the skid marks was parallel to the edge of the bitumen, except that near the centre point they deviated a little towards the other side of the road, though not taking the easterly skid mark more than about one and half metres from the edge of the bitumen.  
     
      
    10 The police officers took a statement at the scene from the appellant, in a notebook, which was signed by the appellant. That statement was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        On 18.5.99 at about 9.30pm I was driving my vehicle LYW 767 south along Lake View Drive, Terrigal at about 50km/hr. I saw a car travelling in the opposite direction and the lights were shining in my eyes. I [passed] a van parked on the side of road. As I did I saw a person on the road. I braked then I hit the person on the road. If the car was not coming in the opposite direction I would have been able to swerve on the other side of the road. The car carried this person for about 5 metres. I then turned the car around and checked to see if the male was alright. Then the ambulance arrived. 
        
       
      
    11 The police took a statement from the respondent in hospital on 27 May 1999. Again, this statement was in a notebook, and it was signed by the respondent. This statement was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        About 9.30pm to 10pm Tuesday 18th May 1999, I was walking along Lakeview Drive, Terrigal. I was heading up to my place in Bundarra Road, Terrigal. I saw a van parked up head (sic) on the right hand side of the road. I stepped out to go around the van and I saw some lights from a car coming the other way. I moved across to get out of the way because I could see it was going to hit me. I can remember the impact of getting hit. I sort of remember going through the air and I definitely remember hitting the deck. I tried to get up. I heard a lady telling me not to get up. I can remember feeling a lot of pain in my legs. I was shaking. I remember someone [wrapping] me in blankets. 
         
         
        Q. Which side of the van did you walk on? 
         
        A. I was walking parallel with where the edge of the van was parked.  
        
       
      
    12 On 4 August 1999, the respondent signed a motor accidents claim form, one page of which is annexed to this judgment.  
     
      
    13 At the trial, the respondent asserted that at no time did he leave the grass and gravel verge of the road and go on to the bitumen; and he said that the wording in the statement that he made on 27 May 1999 concerning stepping out to go around the van had been “misconstrued”. However, he was not cross-examined on the page reproduced from the motor accidents claim form. 
     
      
    14 The appellant’s evidence was that at no time did she drive off the bitumen. Her evidence was that she saw the lights of the other car coming towards her, saw the respondent at the edge of the road, did not immediately brake but then saw the respondent stumble onto the road, and that she had then braked so that the car had slowed before the impact. The passenger Mr. Dybing said that the appellant did not brake before the impact.  
     
      
    15 Mrs. Hurst gave the following evidence (Black 101 UX): 
     
      
       
        
        I turned into Lakeview Drive and started driving up the road and on the other side of the road there was a car coming and it started coming towards me and the lights were shining in my eyes and I thought, “What’s this car doing on my side of the road”, and I just moved quickly off the road to avoid it because it just kept coming … 
        
       
      
    16 Later, at Black 115 D-H, Mrs. Hurst was asked whether she saw the other car “at any time travel from the bitumen onto the grass area either wholly or partly” on the side of the road where the respondent was hit, to which she said “No”. She also gave evidence that she did not hear braking and did not notice the appellant’s car slow down.  
     
      
    17 The respondent gave evidence that he had been at a hotel between about 6.30pm and 9pm, and had consumed 8 or 9 schooners of beer. His blood alcohol reading at 11pm was 0.205g%, giving rise to an estimate of 0.224g% at the time of the accident. The respondent had incorrectly stated in his claim form that he consumed 4 schooners of VB in the 12 hours before the accident. 
     
      
       
      DECISION OF PRIMARY JUDGE 
      
    18 In her judgment, the primary judge referred as follows to the respondent’s evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        The Plaintiff’s evidence is that as he walked in a northerly direction he passed a white van parked on the eastern side of Lakeview Road. This van was parked on the bitumen rather than on the verge. This appears to be the only vehicle parked on the eastern side of the road and was later observed by Mrs Hurst and Constable King. The Plaintiff said that he went around that vehicle remaining on the verge. He denied that he had walked into the road to go around this vehicle. I am persuaded, having regard to all the evidence, that the Plaintiff's recollection of the route that he took is to be relied upon and I accept his evidence that he passed the vehicle on the near-side rather than on the off-side, that is he remained on the grass gravel verge whilst he walked past this vehicle. 
        
       
      
    19 The primary judge made the following comments on the police evidence:  
     
      
       
        
        Whilst the investigating police officers, who certainly could not be qualified as experts in assessing an accident scene, came to the view that the impact occurred halfway along the skid marks, that is not borne out by any of the evidence of those present at the scene of the accident. An assumption that debris lying on the road pinpoints the point of impact is clearly unreliable when quite possibly, the impact occurs when the vehicle is travelling between 50-60 kmh and the victim is struck, thrown onto the bonnet with part of his body impacting and smashing the front windscreen, before he falls to the side of the road. Commonsense dictates that the debris would have been subjected to forces which have not been taken into account but which would necessarily not cause it to fall to the ground at point of impact. A point of impact determined in these circumstances by evidence of debris on the road is highly unreliable. In this case, it does not accord with any of the evidence apart from perhaps, that of the Defendant that she applied the brakes prior to the point of impact. 
        
       
      
    20 The primary judge drew the following conclusion on the issue of liability: 
     
      
       
        
        An analysis of Mrs Hurst's evidence together with that of the Plaintiff and Mr Dybing and the physical evidence relating to the damage to the Defendant's motor vehicle, leads to the following scenario: the Plaintiff was at all relevant times walking on the grass gravel verge, albeit in close proximity to the bitumen surface. The Defendant observed the Plaintiff when she was approximately 40 metres from him. She did not reduce her speed because she saw no necessity to do so as in her view he did not represent a hazard. Thereafter, the Defendant observed the lights of Mrs Hursts vehicle which were shining in her eyes, and for whatever reason veered towards the edge of the road striking the Plaintiff before swerving back across the road into the path of Mrs Hurst's car, the latter being obliged to drive off the road in order to avoid a collision. At no time prior to the accident did the Defendant brake or otherwise reduce her speed although she applied the brakes immediately after impact with the plaintiff, allowing for usual reaction time, and when her car was fully on the sealed surface. 
        
       
      
    21 The primary judge did not explicitly state whether she found the respondent to be a reliable witness. She did say that the appellant’s evidence was inconsistent, and that the appellant was not a reliable witness. She said that Mrs. Hurst’s evidence could be accepted in toto.  
     
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
        
        1. Her Honour erred in that she failed to have proper regard to the opinions advanced by the appellant and failed to enter into, and engage with, evidence presented on behalf of the appellant when assessing the following issues directly relevant to liability. 
         
        2. Her Honour erred in her finding of the route taken by the respondent leading to the accident and the position of the respondent at the moment of impact. 
         
        3. Her Honour erred in finding that the appellant's car swerved toward the respondent. 
         
        4.  
        Her Honour erred in finding that the appellant veered toward the edge of the road and struck the plaintiff before swerving back across the road into the path of Mrs Hurst's car. 
         
        5. Her Honour erred in finding by implication that the appellant's car struck the respondent when the respondent was not on the bitumen surface. 
         
        6. Her Honour erred in finding that the appellant's vehicle veered on to Mrs Hurst's side of the road. 
         
        7. Her Honour erred in rejecting the incontrovertible evidence of the police officers relating to the point of impact and the position of the skid marks on the bitumen surface and the roadway. 
         
        8. Her Honour's conclusions regarding the paths taken by the appellant and respondent leading to the point of impact when considering the whole of the evidence are contrary to compelling inferences, if not glaringly improbable. 
         
        9. The amount awarded to the plaintiff by her Honour was for non-economic loss was demonstrably too large in the circumstances. 
        
       
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    22 Although the appellant’s written submissions covered wider ground, Mr. Arden SC for the appellant in oral submissions relied essentially on three alleged errors by the primary judge: 
     
      
      1. A plainly incorrect finding by the primary judge that the respondent walked past the parked van on the near side, in circumstances where it was clear on the evidence that the respondent was hit by the appellant’s vehicle before he reached the van (within ground 8).  
       
      2. Error in failing to enter into and engage with the signed statement of the respondent that he stepped out to go around the van, recorded in the police notebook, and material to similar effect in the motor accidents claim form (within ground 1). 
       
      3. Adoption of a scenario which was glaringly improbable having regard to the skid marks and Mrs. Hurst’s evidence to the effect that the appellant’s vehicle did not veer onto the grass verge (within ground 8) and failure to enter into and engage with that evidence in relation to the scenario (within ground 1). 
       
      
    23 Mr. Hughes QC for the respondent accepted that the primary judge was in error in her statement that the respondent walked past the parked van on the near side, because it was clear that the respondent was hit before he reached the van; but submitted that this was immaterial in the overall context of the case, and did not vitiate the judgment.  
     
      
    24 Turning to the second point, Mr. Hughes submitted that the statement in the police notebook had to be read having regard to the circumstance that the police were dealing with a young man, with limited education, still being treated in hospital. He referred to the cross-examination of one of the police officers, in which the police officer conceded that none of the material in the notebook statement placed the respondent on the bitumen surface of the road; and accepted that the reference to walking parallel with where the edge of the van was parked could be referring to the kerb side of the van. Mr. Hughes pointed to the comment made by the primary judge to the cross-examiner “I think you have covered it”. He also referred to oral evidence by the respondent, referring to marks made by him on a photograph, to the effect that just before the impact he straightened up to walk along the side of the road; so that the “stepping out” referred to in the statement could mean stepping out in a northerly direction, not stepping out onto the road itself. Mr. Hughes submitted that the respondent had not been cross-examined on the claim form, so that the claim form could not fairly be used to assist in interpreting what was in the statement in the notebook; and also submitted that no submission had been made to the primary judge based on this part of the claim form. (This last submission was accepted as correct by Mr. Arden.) 
     
      
    25 Mr. Hughes also referred to a statement recorded as having been made to a doctor, by inference on 8 June 1999, that the respondent was “on the side of the road when he was hit”.  
     
      
    26 Finally, on this point, Mr. Hughes submitted that it was not to be assumed that, because the primary judge did not deal specifically with the statement to the police, she overlooked it, particularly having regard to the observation she made during cross-examination, referred to above. Mr. Hughes referred particularly to Abalos v. Australian Postal Commission (1990) 171 CLR 167 at 178; Fox v. Percy (2003) 197 ALR 201; and Pledge v. Roads & Traffic Authority (2004) 78 ALJR 572.  
     
      
    27 Turning to the third point, Mr. Hughes submitted that the scenario adopted by the primary judge was supported by her acceptance of the respondent’s evidence as to where he was hit; her rejection of police evidence as to the point of impact; her acceptance of Mr. Dybing’s evidence that there was no braking until after impact; the appellant’s evidence that she veered towards the wrong side of the road; and acceptance of Mrs. Hurst’s evidence that the appellant veered towards her. Mr. Hughes submitted that the skid marks did not exclude the appellant’s vehicle having gone off the surface of the road and hit the respondent, after which the appellant’s vehicle came back onto the road before commencing to skid. Mr. Hughes submitted that the scenario was further supported by glaring inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence, and the implausibility of her evidence that required that the respondent suddenly move from a metre off the bitumen to a position one and a half metres within the bitumen, in virtually a single step.  
     
      
    28 Mr. Hughes also submitted that, in so far as the appellant relied on evidence of intoxication, it was open to the primary judge to accept that the respondent was not so affected as to impair his ability to walk and assess risks.  
     
      
       
      DECISION 
      
    29 In my opinion, the combination of the three matters relied on by the appellant does mean that the primary judge’s finding on liability in this case must be set aside. 
     
      
    30 The finding that the respondent walked past the parked van cannot, in my opinion, be dismissed as being immaterial in the overall context of the case. It shows that the primary judge did not have a clear and correct understanding of the evidence in the case, or of the basic physical circumstances in which this accident occurred. Furthermore, an understanding of the general position of the van in relation to the accident was highly relevant to an assessment of the significance of contemporary statements made by the respondent.  
     
      
    31 As regards the second matter, in my opinion the cross-examination referred to by Mr. Hughes did not throw any relevant light on the interpretation to be given to the statement. It was not suggested that the statement did not fairly record what it was that the respondent said at the time, or that the respondent was under any misapprehension as to what it was he put his signature to. When one has regard to the circumstance that, in this statement, the respondent is placing himself as walking towards the van parked up ahead on the right-hand side of the road, and then says “I stepped out to go around the van and I saw some lights from a car coming the other way”, there is in my opinion no vagueness or ambiguity in what is being asserted. The respondent is asserting an intention to go around the van on the road-side and not the kerb-side of the van. The answer to the subsequent question, “I was walking parallel with where the edge of the van was parked” must in those circumstances refer to walking level with the road-side edge of the van.  
     
      
    32 In my opinion, that was an important piece of evidence in favour of the appellant, when it was clear that the side of the van nearest to the road was well onto the bitumen of the road, albeit some 40 metres away and probably at a point where the bitumen extended to a formed gutter. In my opinion, the primary judge’s failure to consider this piece of evidence, and the respondent’s denial of its import, amounted to a deficiency of reasons. I do not think that the comment made by the judge during cross-examination, a cross-examination which had at best marginal relevance to the interpretation of the document, dispensed with the need to address this particular piece of evidence. Having regard to the other deficiencies that I identify, I do not need to determine whether this alone would have been sufficient to justify appellate intervention on the basis discussed in Misfud v. Campbell (1991) 21 NSWLR 725. 
     
      
    33 If there were any ambiguity in the statement in the police notebook, that ambiguity would be removed when that statement is considered together with the account of the accident given in the accident claim form. Mr. Hughes attempted to dismiss this as being, not the respondent’s account of the accident, but his understanding of the appellant’s account. In my opinion, that idea is fanciful. The configuration of the pedestrian and the three vehicles shown on the diagram, and the expression “walking just on the road past parked cars on the side of the road” make it crystal clear that the respondent’s account of the accident at that time was to the effect that he was proceeding towards walking around the parked van on the road-side of the van. I accept that this document could not be used as a necessary step in demonstrating error by the primary judge, because of the lack of cross-examination and the failure to refer to it in submissions before the primary judge; but it does in my opinion give confirmation to the view I take as to the meaning of the statement recorded in the police notebook. 
     
      
    34 Turning to the third point, the scenario adopted by the primary judge involves a finding that the appellant’s car first veered to its left and went off the bitumen, then veered back to the right and proceeded onto the wrong side of the road before coming to a stop. In submissions, Mr. Hughes substantially conceded that that view could not be reconciled with the skid marks; and submitted that the primary judge’s scenario should be read as meaning that the appellant’s car veered off the bitumen, struck the respondent, and then returned to the bitumen and followed the course indicated by the skid marks; so that the car never actually went to the wrong side of the road, but gave the appearance of being about to do so at the point where the skid marks indicate some movement towards the centre of the road. This approach has two difficulties: first, it is inconsistent with the primary judge’s explicit finding that the appellant’s car swerved back across the road into the path of Mrs. Hurst’s car; and second, it does not explain why the skid marks from the start point directly along the road, approximately parallel with the edge of the bitumen, rather than giving some indication of commencing with a movement of the car from the edge of the bitumen towards the centre of the road. Furthermore, like the primary judge’s scenario, it disregards Mrs. Hurst’s evidence that she saw the appellant’s car coming and then coming towards her, and did not see it travel onto the grass area where the respondent said he was hit. 
     
      
    35 That is, the respondent in substance accepted that the primary judge’s scenario could not be supported, and attempted to rescue it with a modified scenario, which itself has significant difficulties.  
     
      
    36 The respondent also placed substantial reliance on the primary judge’s finding that the respondent was not significantly affected by alcohol, and also on what the respondent submitted to be glaring inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence.  
     
      
    37 I accept that it was open to the primary judge to find that the respondent was not significantly affected by alcohol; although I would consider it an unsatisfactory approach to make this decision independently of a decision concerning all of the circumstances of the case. In my opinion, the appropriate course would have been to have regard to the evidence concerning affectation by alcohol, and take that into account in arriving at a final decision; rather than making a finding that the respondent was not significantly affected by alcohol, independently of consideration of all of the circumstances. However, I would not have regarded that approach as an error which of itself would justify appellate intervention. 
     
      
    38 As regards the inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence, I accept that it was open to the primary judge to find that there were inconsistencies and to regard the appellant as an unreliable witness because of them. However, I do not consider that the inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence were such as to lend powerful support to the respondent’s case. In my opinion, it would have been equally open to the primary judge to regard the inconsistencies as flowing from the appellant’s inability to make precise estimates in terms of distance in metres and times in seconds, in relation to things happening at a time of emergency; and to regard her evidence as a reasonably consistent account, having regard to all the circumstances.  
     
      
    39 In my opinion, the combined effect of the three matters relied on by the appellant requires that the finding on liability be set aside. The question then is, what course should this Court now take. 
     
      
    40 It seems to have been assumed during the hearing in this Court that, if the appeal was allowed, the only possible result was a new trial. Even if this Court were able to conclude that the point of impact was on the bitumen, a finding of negligence against the appellant would still be open; and if there was such a finding, a finding of contributory negligence would be likely and there would be a need to apportion responsibility. It would also be necessary then to assess damages, on the basis of the view of the respondent’s credibility then taken by the Court. There is some question whether there could be a fully satisfactory resolution of these issues by this Court. 
     
      
    41 On the other hand, the alternative may be even less satisfactory. The hearing before the primary judge extended over seven days, there had previously been an arbitration, and there has now been an appeal to this Court, in a matter in which the damages were assessed at a little over $300,000.00. In those circumstances, it seems to me appropriate to express my tentative views as to findings and orders that I may, subject to submissions from the parties, be prepared to make. I would invite written submissions as to whether or not those findings and orders should be made, or whether there should be a new trial. The Court would then decide what order to make on the basis of those submissions. 
     
      
    42 My tentative views are: 
     
      
      1. The impact took place on the bitumen at some point between about where the left wheel skid marks started and the point identified by the police as the point of impact.  
       
      2. The appellant saw the respondent very close to the edge of the bitumen when she was about 40 metres away from him. She was then travelling at about 50-60kph, and the impact occurred about three seconds later. 
       
      3. The appellant did not then slow down, but tried to brake as soon as she saw the respondent step onto the bitumen, the respondent then being about 15-20 metres in front of her. Given a reaction time of about one second, there was little if any effective braking before impact. 
       
      4. Because of the proximity of the respondent to the edge of the bitumen when the appellant first saw him, and the impossibility of deviation to the other side of the road because of the on-coming car, the appellant should have started to slow as soon as she saw the respondent so close to her path. That may seem to be expecting perfection, but a car is a lethal weapon, and to drive with reasonable care, one should where reasonably possible leave a reasonable margin for error by oneself and others, especially where a pedestrian is seen unusually close to traffic lanes: cf.  
      Cook v. Hawes 
       [2002] NSWCA 79 at [15]-[16]. Had the appellant done so, the impact would have been avoided or at least much less severe. 
       
      5. For that reason, the appellant was negligent. The respondent was guilty of contributory negligence, for stepping onto the bitumen road in the path of the appellant’s car. His negligence was much greater, and the appropriate apportionment is 15% to the appellant and 85% to the respondent.  
       
      6. The assessment of the respondent’s damages is not significantly affected by outstanding credibility issues, so the respondent should have a verdict for 15% of the amount awarded, that is $48,375.29.  
       
      
    43 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Respondent to pay appellant’s costs of the appeal, and to have a Suitors’ Fund Certificate if otherwise eligible. 
       
      3. Orders below set aside. 
       
      4. Written submissions to be provided as to further orders to be made, by the appellant within 7 days and by the respondent within a further 7 days. 
       
      
    44 At present, I would tentatively propose the following further order: 
     
      
      5. In lieu of orders below, judgment for the respondent in the sum of $48,375.29 and appellant to pay half the respondent’s costs of the trial.  
       
      
    45 The alternative to this would be an order for a new trial, with costs of the first trial being in the discretion of the judge at the new trial. The Court could also order compulsory mediation. 
     
      
    46 SANTOW JA: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Sheller JA: I agree with Sperling J. 
     
      
    2 Sperling J: This is a Crown appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    3 The respondent was sentenced by Goldring DCJ on 16 April 2004. He had pleaded guilty to three offences committed on 7 March 2002, namely:  
     
      
       
      Count 1:  
      sold a firearm namely a Smith and Wesson .38 calibre revolver to an undercover police operative using the assumed name of Danny and the said Danny was not authorised to possess the firearm by a licence or permit, contrary to section 51(1) of the Firearms Act 1996. The maximum prescribed penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. 
       
       
      Count 2:  
      did possess a firearm, to wit, a Smith and Wesson .38 calibre revolver on which the number had been defaced without being authorised to do so by the Commissioner of Police, contrary to section 66(b) of the Firearms Act 1996. The maximum prescribed penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. 
       
       
      Count 3:  
      did possess a prohibited weapon, to wit, a silencer, not being authorised to do so by licence or permit, contrary to section 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. The maximum prescribed penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. 
       
      
    4 Additionally, the following further offence on Form 1 was taken into account: possess prohibited weapon being a .38 Smith and Wesson pistol. Possession of a pistol without authorisation is an offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years on indictment and for two years if dealt with summarily. 
     
      
    5 The following sentences were imposed 
     
      
       
      Count 1:  
      Taking the offence on Form 1 into account: a non-parole period of two months commencing on 11 April 2004 and expiring on 10 June 2004, and an additional term of ten months to commence on 11 June 2004 and expiring on 10 April 2005. 
       
       
      Count 2:  
      A fixed term of imprisonment for one month commencing on 11 April 2004 and expiring on 10 May 2004. 
       
       
      Count 3: 
       A fixed term of imprisonment for two months commencing on 11 April 2004 and expiring on 10 June 2004. 
       
      
    6 The effective overall sentence was a non-parole period of two months with an additional term of ten months. The sentence being for less than three years, the respondent was entitled to be released at the end of the non-parole period which expired on 10 June 2004.  
     
      
    7 On 17 May 2004, a notice of appeal signed by the Director of Public Prosecutions was filed and served on the respondent. That was five weeks after the date on which the respondent was sentenced. 
     
      
    8 At the sentencing hearing a statement of facts was tendered by consent. Statements and other documents were tendered at the sentencing hearing which supported the statement of facts. The respondent gave evidence. A pre-sentence report by the Queensland Department of Corrective Services dated 13 April 2004 and a report by Dr I Colls, consultant psychiatrist, dated 6 April 2004 were tendered. A character reference by Mr P Morrison concerning the respondent’s prior employment with the Queensland Corrective Services Commission was tendered. A further reference by Mr K Johnson, relating to other employment was also tendered. 
     
      
    9 The facts of the case as presented to the sentencing judge are as follows. In February 2002, an undercover New South Wales Police Officer, “Danny”, made contact in Queensland with an associate of the respondent, Mr C Lovejoy, who had a business involving the sale of military paraphernalia. Mr Lovejoy introduced Danny to the respondent. On 4 March 2002, in the course of a telephone conversation, it was agreed that Danny would purchase a .38 Smith and Wesson five shot revolver for $2000. On 7 March 2002, Danny and the respondent met at Ballina. During the meeting, Danny purchased the revolver from the respondent for $2000 cash. During the meeting, the respondent showed Danny a silencer for a pistol. 
     
      
    10 The $2000 paid by Danny was distributed as follows. The supplier of the firearm received $1100. Mr Lovejoy received $500. That left $400 for the appellant. 
     
      
    11 The .38 Smith and Wesson revolver was examined by police. The serial number at the base of the stock had been obliterated, although a serial number was located on another part of the firearm. 
     
      
    12 The respondent held a Queensland firearms licence permitting possession of a pistol. However, the respondent did not hold any relevant licence or permit under New South Wales law.  
     
      
    13 At no stage did the respondent inquire as to whether Danny was the holder of a licence or permit to hold a firearm. 
     
      
    14 On 19 November 2002, the respondent’s residence in Queensland was raided by the police. A silencer and other items were found. The silencer was the same item as was shown to the police operative, Danny, on 7 March 2002.  
     
      
    15 The respondent was charged under Queensland law with unlawful possession of a weapon as defined, namely the silencer, while not being authorised to possess such a device; secondly, with possession of a modified firearm, namely, a .22 calibre Beretta handgun which had been modified to take a silencer; and, thirdly, with possession and acquiring of restricted items, namely, a telescopic baton, three sets of shackles and two pairs of handcuffs. 
     
      
    16 The respondent was extradited to New South Wales to face charges relating to the Ballina meeting with Danny. He remained in custody until 25 November 2002, when he was released on conditional bail. 
     
      
    17 The respondent pleaded guilty to the Queensland charges. On 22 July 2003, he was convicted and fined $2000 by a Queensland court.  
     
      
    18 On 20 October 2003, the respondent came before Gibson DCJ in the District Court in Sydney, charged on three counts. At that stage, the first charge was for selling a firearm to Danny at Brisbane on 2 March 2002. (That charge related to the agreement to sell the firearm made in the course of the telephone conversation prior to the Ballina meeting.) The second and third charges correspond with the first and third of the three charges for which the respondent was ultimately sentenced in New South Wales. 
     
      
    19 On that date, 20 October 2003, the respondent pleaded not guilty to the first charge (selling firearms at Brisbane) and guilty to the other two charges.  
     
      
    20 The first charge was heard by Gibson DCJ without a jury. The charge was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  
     
      
    21 On 16 April 2004, the respondent was indicted before Goldring DCJ, on the three charges which give rise to the present appeal. The respondent pleaded guilty to the three charges, that is, the new charge (count 2) and the two earlier charges to which the appellant had pleaded guilty (now counts 1 and 3). The sentencing hearing proceeded and the appellant was sentenced on that date.  
     
      
    22 The respondent’s personal history, as appears from the evidence before his Honour was as follows. The respondent was born on 17 May 1962. He was 39 years of age at the time of the offences. He had no significant criminal record. 
     
      
    23 The respondent had joined the Navy at the age of 16 and had served for ten years. He acquired considerable expertise in relation to weaponry. He was then employed for something over four years as a prison officer with the Queensland Corrective Services Commission. In mid 1993, just prior to closure of the centre where he was employed, he was injured in the course of a riot, being knocked unconscious and receiving a dislocated shoulder and a fractured collar-bone. A colleague received more serious injuries and was taken away. Notwithstanding his injuries, the respondent was left in charge of a large number of prisoners for some hours. In consequence of this experience, the respondent suffered post-traumatic stress disorder for which he later received treatment. 
     
      
    24 Following an 18 month period of unemployment, the respondent obtained a position as a security manager which he held for ten months until retrenched. He was then unemployed again for about ten months, until he obtained a position as operations manager of a security company based at Port Moresby. He was there for about a year, returning to Australia to attend to family matters.  
     
      
    25 It was at about the time of his return to Australia in 1996 that he started to experience extreme difficulty in his everyday functioning as a result of the post-traumatic stress disorder. He was assessed unfit for work at that stage and was granted a disability pension. He had since worked on a casual basis for a labour-hire company. He was currently earning about $400 per week in addition to a part disability pension. 
     
      
    26 Dr Colls, whose report was tendered, supported the earlier diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. This, however, had improved. The respondent reported ongoing symptoms of sleep disturbance, hyper-vigilance, a persecutory view of the world, irritability and easy arousal, but Dr Colls did not think that the respondent now met the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. 
     
      
    27 At the time of the sentencing hearing, the respondent also suffered from stomach ulcers and passed blood regularly. He was afflicted with sores which he attributed to his state of stress. 
     
      
    28 At the time of the relevant offences, the respondent had been required to leave the place where he had been living and had been provided with accommodation by Mr Lovejoy. It was Mr Lovejoy who was first approached by the police operative, Danny, and who introduced Danny to the respondent. The arrangement between the respondent and Mr Lovejoy was that the respondent would pay an amount as rent and would also assist Mr Lovejoy in his business. 
     
      
    29 According to the respondent, this was the only occasion in which he had engaged in the unlawful sale of a firearm. He said he did so on this occasion because of the financial pressures he was under at the time and in order not to put Mr Lovejoy offside. That is consistent with the way the proceeds of sale of the pistol to Danny were distributed. 
     
      
    30 Although there was evidence that the respondent had told Danny that he was able to obtain a range of firearms, there was no evidence that the respondent had sold firearms illegally on any prior occasion or was doing more on that occasion than providing Danny with a choice for a one-off sale. 
     
      
    31 The respondent said he was led to believe that the revolver sold to Danny was to be used only for protection and that there was no question in his mind that it might be used for any criminal purpose. He was not cross-examined to controvert this evidence, and this was a matter about which it was reasonable to expect the Crown would be informed since Danny was a police operative. 
     
      
    32 As for a serial number having been removed from the revolver, the respondent said that he did not notice that the number had been removed from the butt of the firearm.  
     
      
    33 As for possession of the silencer, the respondent said he was carrying that in his bag. Goldring DCJ thought that showing the silencer to Danny was a bit of showing off on the respondent’s part. There was no evidence of the respondent offering the silencer to Danny for sale, and he still had it eight months later when his residence was raided by the Queensland police. Punishment for possession of the silencer was subsumed in the fine imposed for the Queensland offences in July 2003. That was not precisely the same offence, but this was an ameliorating factor nonetheless. 
     
      
    34 The respondent said that the Beretta which was the subject of one of the Queensland offences was his authorised club pistol. The Queensland charge in relation to that firearm was not that he was unauthorised to have the pistol but that it had been modified to take the silencer. The respondent said, at the sentencing hearing in Sydney, that he used the pistol to shoot vermin such as toads, and that it was threaded to take the silencer in order to dampen the sound of the shots. That evidence was not challenged by cross-examination. 
     
      
    35 The baton found at the respondent’s residence was obtained in the course of his prior work as a security officer. The handcuffs and shackles had been obtained in the course of his employment as a prison officer. He said that he had offered to return these when he gave up that employment but he was told to keep them because the centre was being closed. 
     
      
    36 The respondent said that he had joined a shooting club after leaving the Navy and had, thereafter, maintained a Queensland pistol licence. Following the convictions in Queensland, in July 2003, he had been required to surrender the licence.  
     
      
    37 Mr Lovejoy was also charged in relation to the sale of the revolver to Danny. The respondent had offered to give evidence against him but the police had declined the offer on the basis that they had sufficient material. 
     
      
    38 In his remarks on sentence, Goldring DCJ recorded the respondent’s personal history, the circumstances leading up to the offences and the circumstances of the offences themselves. His Honour observed that in view of the respondent’s lifetime involvement with guns, he ought to have known that there was an obligation to take care not to sell a firearm to anyone who was not authorised to possess such a weapon. His Honour noted that there was clearly a degree of planning, and that this was a commercial operation, the respondent holding himself out as a person able to supply firearms. There was total disregard for whether the purchaser was authorised to own such a weapon.  
     
      
    39 His Honour regarded the offences as being serious. He noted that general deterrence was of particular importance in relation to offences of this nature. 
     
      
    40 His Honour found special circumstances in three respects: as he understood it, the respondent would have to serve his term in prison in protection because of his background; he would be serving his sentence in New South Wales, whereas his personal associations were in Queensland; then there were the respondent’s health problems which would make prison more difficult for him. 
     
      
    41 His Honour’s starting point for a sentence under count 1, which was to be the effective sentence, was 18 months. He reduced that period by two months for the respondent’s willingness to assist the authorities and by a further four months for the utilitarian value of the early pleas of guilty, producing a sentence of 12 months. 
     
      
    42 When formally setting the sentences, his Honour erroneously did so in the manner required for offences committed after 1 February 2003, that is, by first determining a non-parole period, whereas the offences were committed before that date. A failure to follow correct sentencing procedure can warrant intervention by this court but need not do so. 
     
      
    43 Quite properly, having regard to the considerations I have mentioned, the gravamen of the Crown’s case, as argued on the hearing of the appeal, was that the non-parole period under count 1 was insufficient to reflect the criminality involved in relation to that offence and the offence on Form 1. 
     
      
    44 As part of that argument, it was pointed out on behalf of the Crown that the sentencing judge was mistaken as to maximum penalties and, accordingly, about the relative seriousness of the offences involved. His Honour said that the maximum penalty for the offence under count 1 was 14 years. In fact it was five years. His Honour also said that selling an unauthorised firearm is equally as serious as possessing an unauthorised firearm, whereas the maximum sentences in relation to counts 1 and 3 were respectively five years and 14 years. His Honour was mistaken in both respects. The Crown sought to use the error in an elliptical way. It was submitted that the sentence under count 1 was the more erroneous because his Honour thought the maximum penalty for the offence was higher than it actually was. I would reject that line of reasoning. Manifest error is to be judged objectively by reference to the correct maximum sentences and other relevant considerations. 
     
      
    45 In any event, the Crown is responsible for the error. His Honour asked whether the maximum penalty in relation to counts 1 and 3 was 14 years and, in relation to count 2, five years, to which the Crown’s representative said that was correct. It does not behove the Crown, in these circumstances, to endeavour to use the error in criticising the sentence. 
     
      
    46 The objective seriousness of the offences under count 1 and on Form 1 is ameliorated in this case by the absence of criminal intent beyond the bare elements of the offences. The offences were not committed in the context of broader criminal activity or for any other criminal purpose. The offences were far from being the more serious of such offences. That said, however, firearm offences of this kind are always serious. 
     
      
    47 There were subjective considerations in mitigation of penalty in this case. It appears that the respondent was vulnerable to being drawn into dealings with the police operative, Danny, arising from a combination of inadequate income and his dependency on Mr Lovejoy for accommodation and for consideration in relation to the payment of rent. This was to be the respondent’s first time in custody. Imprisonment was also likely to be more onerous for him than for the ordinary run of prisoner by reason of his background as a prison officer and because of residual elements of his post-traumatic stress disorder and other health problems.  
     
      
    48 Weighing up the objective seriousness of the offences in question and the subjective considerations mentioned above, the non-parole period under count 1 was manifestly inadequate, and plainly so. 
     
      
    49 That, however, is not the end of the matter. There are special constraints in relation to Crown appeals against sentence. If it comes to re-sentencing, the sentence will be set towards the lower end of the range for the offence in the circumstances of the case because of the principle of double jeopardy. Secondly, this court has a discretion whether to intervene at all, even if the sentence is manifestly inadequate and a more severe sentence would be warranted but for that discretion. 
     
      
    50 In the present case there are a number of factors bearing on the exercise of the court’s discretion. First, the respondent did not receive notice of the appeal until some five weeks into a two months non-parole period. In a case as plain as this and where a short sentence is involved, notice should be given within days rather than weeks.  
     
      
    51 Secondly, when this appeal came on for hearing on 9 July 2004, the respondent had served the effective non-parole period and had been released at the expiration of that period some four weeks earlier. Meanwhile, the sentence continued to run. The period on parole pending the decision of this court would count as service of any extended non-parole period. This consideration reduced the utility of extending the non-parole period. 
     
      
    52 Thirdly, the court now had evidence that the respondent elected not to go into protection in prison, which he understandably believed might increase rather than decrease the danger to himself by drawing attention to his background as a prison officer. He was nonetheless recognised and was fearful of what the consequence might be. That state of mind was no doubt exacerbated by the residual effects of post-traumatic stress disorder which included a paranoid element (as previously described). Fourthly, the court had evidence of constructive efforts by the respondent to resume a normal, productive life during the time between his release and the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    53 In these circumstances, there would be an element of cruelty in now requiring the respondent to return to prison for what would be a relatively short further period by reason of the double jeopardy principle. 
     
      
    54 The appeal should be dismissed in the exercise of the court’s discretion. 
     
      
    55 This is a special case. The non-parole period for firearms offences of this kind was seriously inadequate. The outcome I propose should not be seen as precedent for any other case. 
     
      
    56 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: Hidden J will deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: After a trial in the District Court the appellant, Salvador Alex Diaz, was found guilty of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment to which I shall refer later. He appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    3 He was tried jointly with a co-offender, JN, who also faced a second charge arising from the same incident. JN was found guilty of both charges and was also sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 It is unnecessary to refer to the evidence in any detail. On a night early in December 2000 the complainant, a 15-year-old girl, was with the appellant and JN at Darling Harbour. They were drinking cask wine and she became well intoxicated. That was not in contest at the trial and, indeed, there was abundant evidence to that effect in the Crown case. It was the case for the appellant and JN that they also were intoxicated. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant had forcible intercourse with her while JN held her down, over her screams of protest. She said that JN then had intercourse with her himself, in the teeth of her protests, giving rise to the second charge against him. The two men then left and she made prompt complaint to a security guard in the area and to a police officer who attended the scene. There was DNA evidence consistent with the appellant and JN having had sexual contact with her. 
     
      
    5 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. However, in an electronically recorded interview with the police he said that he was drunk and that at one stage the complainant had behaved in a sexually provocative manner but that, because of his intoxication, he had no recollection of the period of time during which the sexual assaults were alleged to have been committed. Both his case and that of his co-offender were conducted on the basis that sexual intercourse had occurred, the only issues being whether the complainant had consented and, if she had not, whether they were aware that she was not consenting. 
     
      
    6 Two grounds of appeal against conviction have been argued. The first is that the trial judge failed adequately to direct the jury about the danger of unreliability in the evidence of the complainant because of her state of intoxication. The second is that his Honour also failed to direct the jury adequately about the intoxication of the appellant. 
     
      
    7 Neither the Crown in this court nor Miss Kluss, who represented the appellant, appeared at the trial. 
     
      
    8 As to the complainant's intoxication, his Honour gave no direction as such but he did refer to it in his brief summary of the Crown case. He also pointed out that the Crown case depended upon the reliability of the complainant's evidence, which was uncorroborated, and he added a warning about the danger of convicting in the absence of corroboration. 
     
      
    9 Both defence counsel asked his Honour to fashion a warning in accordance with s 165 of the Evidence Act about the bearing of the complainant's intoxication upon the reliability of her evidence, especially on the question of consent and the question of whether, if she were not consenting, she adequately conveyed that fact to the appellant and his co-offender. His Honour declined to do so and in this, Miss Kluss argues, he fell into error. 
     
      
    10 However, the relevance of intoxication to reliability of a witness' evidence is a matter well within the experience of juries and, in the particular circumstances of this case, the relevance of intoxication to this complainant's reliability is also such a matter well within the experience of jurors. Neither at common law nor under s 165 would it normally require a warning by the trial judge based upon the experience of the courts. 
     
      
    11 On this aspect it is instructive to turn to the judgment of Kirby J, with whom the Chief Justice and Smart AJ agreed, in R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298 at [61] ff. At [62] his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In the nature of things, evidence given by all witnesses may be unreliable. Evidence is necessarily dependent upon observation and recollection. Both are fallible. However, s165 is not dealing with unreliability in this sense. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts in dealing with certain types of evidence or because there is a danger that the jury may overestimate the probative value of certain evidence…"" 
        
       
      
    12 Whether in the present case it could be said that s 165 did not require any warning at all, or whether it might be said that there were good reasons within the meaning of subs (3) of that section not to provide a warning, is not currently to the point and need not be determined. 
     
      
    13 The complainant's intoxication had been dealt with in the addresses of all three counsel. As I have said, his Honour made it abundantly clear that the Crown case turned upon the reliability of her evidence and gave a warning about the danger of convicting in the absence of corroboration, even though no such warning was required: see s164 of the Evidence Act.  The interests of justice did not call for any further direction about this aspect of the case. 
     
      
    14 As to the evidence of the appellant's own intoxication, his Honour did give a direction as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Members of the jury, intoxication is clearly a matter which you have to consider in this trial. It is relevant as to whether the accused that you are considering knew, for example, that the party that you were considering was consenting. That, of course, that his state of intoxication would be a matter which you would take into account. It is not a question, of course, of looking back afterwards to decide whether at some later stage he had had a belief that she was consenting to what happened. It is a question of you looking at the situation as it was at the time these events occurred."" 
        
       
      
    15 That direction was undoubtedly brief, but in the circumstances of the case it appears to me that it was adequate. The Crown prosecutor raised rule 4 in opposition to this ground of appeal but the point was taken by counsel for the co-offender at trial, whose interest was the same as that of the appellant and, in any event, I am prepared to deal with this ground of appeal on its merits. 
     
      
    16 Apart from that brief direction his Honour did, of course, refer to the competing submissions of counsel about this aspect of the evidence, that is, the intoxication of the appellant and of his co-accused. It must be said that what his Honour said about all aspects of intoxication, that of the complainant, the appellant and the co-accused, was rather spare and more might have been said about it. Nevertheless, it appears to me that what was said was adequate to give the jury such guidance as they needed to understand the resolution of that issue and adequately put the defence case: cf R v Wilson & Ors (1986) 22 A Crim R 131, per King CJ at 134-5. 
     
      
    17 Accordingly, in my view, neither ground of appeal has been made out and I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    18 Let me turn, then, to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. The offence of which the appellant was found guilty carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment: see s 61J of the Crimes Act. The circumstance of aggravation alleged was his being in company with JN at the time of the offence. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years, 11 months. It is clear that his Honour intended an effective non-parole period of 6 years but reduced that period so as to take account of a discrete period of pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    19 Two matters have been argued in the application. Miss Kluss complains of excessive disparity between the sentence passed upon the appellant and the effective sentence passed upon the co-offender, JN. On the joint count, JN was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. On the second count, against JN only, he was sentenced to a concurrent term of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. For both offences, then, he was sentenced effectively to 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
    20 There were obvious differences in the subjective circumstances of both men, which Miss Kluss acknowledges. Her argument is that, even allowing for those differences, the disparity is such as to engender in the appellant a justifiable sense of grievance. Miss Kluss points in written submissions to the fact that JN stood for sentence for two offences, but it must be said that both offences clearly arose out of the same incident and it is a situation in which concurrent sentences were entirely appropriate. 
     
      
    21 It is the other subjective features which are more important. JN was but 17 years old at the time of the offence; the appellant was 25. That is a significant difference in age, even allowing for evidence in the appellant's case that he is immature and of very low intelligence. The appellant had an unfavourable criminal record, including a sentence of imprisonment for a charge of robbery in company. JN had, effectively, no criminal record at all. There were apparently a couple of minor entries in the Children's Court which his Honour saw as of no significance. Importantly, the appellant was on bail in respect of that offence of robbery in company at the time this offence was committed. The combination of those subjective backgrounds and the fact that JN was entitled to the special considerations governing the sentence of juveniles, leads me to the conclusion that the disparity, albeit marked, is not such as to engender in the appellant a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    22 Finally, Miss Kluss argues that his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period. I put to one side his Honour's small adjustment to the non-parole period to take account of pre-sentence custody. There certainly was evidence from which special circumstances might have been found. There was evidence, by way of a psychological report and oral evidence, that the appellant had a very difficult upbringing, including a very traumatic period in his native El Salvador before he migrated with his family to this country. He suffers from epilepsy. He had an on-going alcohol problem and, as I have said, his intellectual capacity was assessed as low and his personality as immature.  
     
      
    23 That said, whether his subjective case might amount to special circumstances warranting departure from the usual proportion is very much a matter of judgment in the instant case. The proper approach to a non-parole period and to special circumstances has been considered authoritatively by the Chief Justice in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 and was revisited by his Honour in R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172. 
     
      
    24 The judgment of a trial judge that subjective circumstances do not warrant a departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period is one with which this court will not lightly interfere. No doubt this appellant will need considerable assistance to readjust to society should he be released to parole but the sentence which his Honour has structured is such as to leave him with two years of parole eligibility. In any event, it was necessary for the non-parole period appropriately to reflect considerations of retribution and deterrence in a case as serious as this. 
     
      
    25 In all those circumstances, I am not satisfied that his Honour erred in his approach to the assessment of the non-parole period. It does not appear to me that either of the complaints in relation to the sentence have been made out. The case was certainly worthy of argument and I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but would dismiss that appeal also. 
     
      
    26 SPIGELMAN CJ: Subject to one matter, I agree with the reasons of Hidden J. His Honour, at the outset of his reasons, indicated that the appellant and his co-offender left the presence of the victim after the act of sexual intercourse by the co-offender. As I understand the evidence, in fact the appellant left after his act of sexual intercourse and before the act of sexual intercourse by the co-offender. This is reflected in the charges. The circumstance of aggravation, in the case of the appellant, was that the act occurred in company, whereas the circumstance of aggravation in the case of the co-offender, was the fact that the victim was less than 16 years. 
     
      
    27 I don't believe this factual difference makes any difference to his Honour's reasons. It can go only to the question of sentence and the issue of parity that has arisen. It is not such as to give me any cause to doubt his Honour's reasons on the question of sentence, particularly the issue of parity, with which I fully agree. 
     
      
    28 I agree with the order proposed by Hidden J. 
     
      
    29 BUDDIN J: I agree with the order proposed by Hidden J and the reasons that his Honour has provided. I also agree with the additional remarks by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    30 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order is as Hidden J proposes.

     Regina v Simon Crowther-Wilkinson 
    On 28 March 2003 the appellant, Simon Crowther-Wilkinson, was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years for murder. His co-accused, James Cowie was found not guilty. He appeals against this conviction but not against the sentence. The appellant had been a silent partner in a partnership with the deceased in a security company, Excell Security Pty Limited (“Excell”). The deceased’s body was found floating in the Hawkesbury River wrapped in plastic, metal 3/8 inch steel galvanised chains and 12 mm D-shackles. The Crown case was that he had been shot once in the back of the head, consistent with a .22 calibre bullet having been fired by either the appellant or James Cowie, with the other present and assisting or encouraging the killer. The deceased’s body had then been transported to the Hawkesbury River and dumped from a small aluminium boat. Ground 1 – Verdict UnreasonableHeld: The Crown relied on 40 strands in a circumstantial case. The matters were all before the jury and properly taken into account by them. The Crown case was compelling and the test in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 was not made out. Ground 2 – A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury that they could not convict the appellant unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had planned the murder of the deceased The appellant did not seek this direction at trial. Rather it was positively indicated that it was not needed. The circumstances when this direction should be given are as stated in Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 and R v Zaiter [2004] NSWCCA 35. Held: The Crown’s case was pursued on the basis that the appellant instigated and planned the murder and was party to a joint criminal enterprise. The proof of this lay in the overwhelming circumstantial case. Having regard to the way in which the case was conducted, and the acceptance at trial that the Shepherd direction was not required, leave under rule 4 should be rejected. Ground 3 – The trial miscarried by reason of the publication on the internet, both before and during the trial, of two interlocutory judgmentsTwo interlocutory judgments were published on the Court’s website (www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/sc) during the trial. The first was in regard to the application of Mr Cowie for a separate trial (R v Crowther-Wilkinson and Cowie [2002] NSWSC 1207), and the second (R v Crowther-Wilkinson and Cowie [2003] NSWSC 44) concerned the admissibility of a statement Mr Cowie made to police. Generally it is to be accepted that juries can be trusted to obey directions given: R v Bell NSWCCA 9 October 1998, Glennon v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 6003, Hinch v Attorney General (Vic) (No. 2) (1998) 164 CLR 15 at 74, Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 at 99, R v Yill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 453/4, and R v Laguancio (2000) VSCA 33 at para 24. The authorities favour the view that the mere possibility of a jury having acquired prejudicial or extraneous knowledge during trial would be insufficient to give rise to an unfair trial or a miscarriage of justice: Glennon v The Queen, Murphy v The Queen (1988-89) 167 CLR 94. The decision in R v Rudkowsky NSWCCA 15 December 1992 per Gleeson CJ (CrippsJA and McInerney J agreeing), (turning on whether the court can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdict and the jury would have reached the same verdict if the irregularity had not occurred) was distinguishable. It was there assumed that the jury had accessed the material which had been incorrectly allowed to go into the jury room. The question for the Court turns upon a realistic appraisal of whether a miscarriage of justice eventuated because the presence of the material on the internet posed an unacceptably high risk of prejudice to the appellant. Held: The ground of appeal fails. There is no evidence to suggest any juror accessed the internet; the jury were given directions to look at the whole of the evidence impartially and rationally; there was a general direction on the second day by the trial judge not to surf the internet; in the summing up the jury was again directed to decide the case purely on the evidence; most of the facts referred to in the judgments were placed before the jury and were self evident; and finally the case against the appellant was a compelling one. Orders1. Appeal dismissed;2. Conviction and sentence below confirmed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was jointly indicted with James Cowie on a charge that between 6 June 2000 and 7 June 2000 they murdered Graeme Andrew Adams. Each pleaded not guilty, and their trial commenced on 3 February 2003. Several pre-trial issues were heard and determined before a jury was empanelled on 10 February 2003. That jury was discharged on 12 February, and a new jury was empanelled on the following day.2 On 28 March 2003 the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with respect to the appellant, and with a verdict of not guilty in the case of Mr Cowie. The appellant was thereafter sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years. He now appeals against that conviction. He does not seek leave to appeal against the sentence.  
     
      
      FACTS 
       
      
    3 The appellant and the deceased were partners in a security company, Excell Security Pty Limited (“Excell”), which was situated at 4/3 Warrah Street Chatswood. By reason of difficulties in relation to certain staff members who had transferred to the company from a failed security company, Blue Falcon, and who had outstanding claims for superannuation, the deceased’s position in Excell was as a silent partner. Although he was initially appointed as a Director he resigned that office on 30 June 1999. 4 It was common ground that the deceased had a meeting with the appellant, at Excell's office, on the evening of 6 June 2000. He failed to keep the plans which he had made to meet up with his partner, Janelle Johnson, at about 9:30 PM that night. Attempts to locate or to contact him that night, and on the following day, were unsuccessful. There was also evidence to show that he had not engaged in any financial transactions after this day, and the fact that he was last seen alive in the company of the appellant and Mr Cowie, was relied upon by the Crown as a significant strand in its circumstantial case. 5 On 12 July 2000, his body was found floating in the middle of the Hawkesbury River near Dangar Island, about 750 metres from Brooklyn. His head was covered by a beanie and wrapped in a plastic bag, which was held at the neck by an elastic octopus strap. A blue plastic sheet was wrapped around him, and the lower part of his body was wrapped in two lengths of 3/8 inch, mild steel hot galvanised chain, and five 12 mm D-shackles. The lengths of the chains were 11.9 m and 5.7 m respectively and they had a combined weight of 32 kgs. They were free of rust or corrosion as were four of the shackles.6 It was the Crown case that the deceased had been shot once through the back of the neck by a projectile that had shattered, but was consistent with having been a .22 calibre bullet. There was no exit wound. There was a hole in the beanie in line with the neck injury, and it was found to have propellant particles embedded in the fabric which were consistent with the shot having been fired at the back of the deceased's neck from close range.7 It was the Crown case that the deceased had been shot, at Excell, on the night of 6 June 2000, either by the appellant, or by James Cowie, each having been present and assisting or encouraging the other, and that his body had then been driven up to the Hawkesbury River and dumped from a small aluminium boat, which had recently been hired by the appellant, in circumstances where it had been heavily weighted in the expectation that it would never rise to the surface and provide the key forensic links upon which the Crown relied.8 Although the precise period over which the body of the deceased had been in the water could not be determined, there was evidence from Dr Langlois and Dr Berrents to suggest that the extent of decomposition, and the accumulation of marine growth on the clothes was such as to suggest that it must have been in the River for at least a few weeks. There was evidence to the effect that there were no injuries or fractures found of the kind which might have been expected had the body been dropped from the nearby bridge.9 The absence of bruising to the neck of the deceased, Dr Langlois said, was consistent with the octopus strap and bag having been affixed after death, that is, after circulation had stopped. He also said that the brainstem injury would have resulted in immediate death. Since there was no exit wound or arterial damage, there would not have been any substantial bleeding. The use of the plastic bag and plastic sheets, he suggested, was consistent with attempts having been made to prevent, or to catch, any leakage of blood or bodily fluids. Additionally, he said, any fragments of tissue generated when the bullet struck the neck of the deceased would have been sucked back into the wound by reason of those fragments having been tiny, and by reason of the negative pressure that would have been created following discharge of the weapon.10 These matters were relied upon by the Crown to explain the absence of any findings of blood or human tissue in the premises of Excell or in the Holden Rodeo utility of the appellant. The Crown case was that the body was most likely carried in the boat later mentioned in these reasons.11 The Crown case was entirely circumstantial, there having been no admissions made by either accused. This was the second trial faced by the appellant, an earlier trial having resulted in a hung jury. Mr Cowie had not been a party to that trial, having been discharged at committal. He had later been the subject of an ex officio indictment. 
     
      
      THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
      
    12 Three grounds of appeal are relied upon as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ground 1 - the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence; 
       
       
      (b) Ground 2 - a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury that they could not convict the appellant unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had planned the murder of the deceased; and 
       
       
      (c) Ground 3 - the trial miscarried by reason of the publication on the Internet, both before and during the trial, of two interlocutory judgments. 
       
       
      GROUND 1 – VERDICT UNREASONABLE 
       
      
    13 The relevant test as to whether the verdict was or was not unreasonable is in no doubt, being that stated by the majority in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 497: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    14 The trial, and the appeal, were conducted by the defence, on the basis that the Crown could not exclude, as a reasonable possibility that the fatal shot had been fired by Mr Cowie spontaneously, and not as part of a joint criminal enterprise to which the appellant was a party. That, it was submitted, opened up the possibility that the appellant's criminality was confined to that of an accessory after the fact whose role simply involved assisting Mr Cowie in disposing of the body after the killing.15 It was submitted that the Crown case against the appellant was therefore bound to fail unless he was shown to have been the shooter, or to have pre-planned the killing and to have been present aiding and encouraging Mr Cowie to carry out this act. Additionally, or alternatively, it was argued, at trial, that there was a reasonable possibility left open that a person or persons other than Mr Cowie and the appellant had been responsible for the murder.  
     
      
    16 These submissions require careful analysis of the evidence, which was relied upon as making out the Crown's circumstantial case. 
     
      
      (a) Evidence Relied Upon to show Pre-Planning  
       
      
    17 This evidence went to several matters: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The Convening of the 6 June Meeting 
        
       
      
    18 There was evidence from Ms Johnson that by the time of his disappearance, the deceased was struggling financially, that he had been given a notice to move out of his rented accommodation at Leichardt because he was behind in the rent, and that he had expressed concerns in relation to the appellant's management of Excell.19 In particular he had said that he had no idea of Excell’s current financial position, that it had not kept up repayments on his car, that he had been trying for a month to get hold of its financial statements, that the appellant had kept cancelling appointments, and that he did not really trust him. He also claimed that the key which he had been given to the Excell office did not fit.20 Ms Johnson said that, over the five or six weeks before his disappearance, he had indicated that he wished to become more involved in Excell's business, that he had obtained the May 2000 general ledger and that he had made an appointment with his accountant to look into the business. A search of the deceased's home on 16 June located a number of financial records for Excell, including those for the month of May.21 Ms Kristeller, the Excell administration officer, and partner of the appellant, confirmed that, in May 2000, the appellant had informed her that the deceased wanted to become more involved in Excell. She said that she and Mr Douglas, who had previously worked for Blue Falcon, were opposed to this, but that the appellant had said that he had a “right to be there”.22 Mr Clarke, a former Blue Falcon employee who transferred to Excell, similarly said that about three months before he made a statement to police (on 31 July 2000), the appellant had informed him that the deceased wished to become more involved in the business, and that he (Mr Clarke) had indicated he was not pleased because of his previous experience of not being paid on time when employed at Blue Falcon. The appellant said, on his account, that the deceased would not have anything to do with the business.23 Each of Ms Kristeller and Mr Douglas, the Excell operations manager, gave evidence to the effect that the appellant had never seen anything to indicate that the deceased should not have access to the Excell books, while the former also said that she had not heard of any discussion in which the appellant had indicated a desire to keep the activities of Excell, including its proposed Olympic security contract, a secret from the deceased. In her statement to police she had said that the appellant had informed her that the deceased, as a silent partner, had a right to see all of Excell's material.  
     
      
    24 Karen Jones, Excell’s former business manager, similarly said that the appellant had told her that the deceased could look at the books at any time. She also said that she had advised the deceased on 16 February 2000 that Excell was practically insolvent. 25 Mr De Hart, who was the appellant’s accountant, gave evidence of the deceased expressing concerns to him, in relation to the financial position of Excell which he thought should be making bigger profits. He was shown a profit and loss statement for May, but indicated to the appellant, on 30 May, that in order to advise him, he needed more information, such as the general ledger. He did not, however, see the deceased again, after giving him this advice on 30 May.26 Matthew Donnachie, an insurance consultant and friend of the deceased, said that, over the days leading up to 30 May, the deceased had a discussion in which he informed him that he was going to have a meeting with the appellant on the night of 6 June, in the course of which he indicated that he was frustrated about his lack of money and about not having been paid for the sale of Blue Falcon to Excell. According to him the deceased said ""I'm going to have a showdown with Simon. I want to get the books. Skinny [Richard Skinner] said that I should get the books and have a look at them"". It was his recollection that the deceased also said that he expected that the meeting would be ""confrontational and he was going to have it out once and for all"".27 On 5 June he said that the deceased phoned him and left a message to the effect that he would come and see him to discuss the meeting that he was having on the following evening with the appellant. He did not however keep the appointment.28 The deceased's mother, Patricia Adams, also said that the deceased had informed her on the morning of 6 June that he was short of money and that he had a meeting arranged for that night at Excell, with his partner, to fix the problem.29 Similarly Mr Skinner, a friend of the deceased, said that the latter had informed him on 6 June, of the meeting which had been fixed for that night, and mentioned that they were to discuss the appellant's need to obtain the signature of the deceased on a bank guarantee in relation to a contract. Whether this had related to an Olympic contract was uncertain, as he indicated, on reflection, that he may have learned of that contract in some later discussions. He said however that the deceased asked for his advice about signing the guarantee, and that his advice had been not to do so because of his debts. The deceased, on his account, then indicated that he would not sign the document. It was his impression from the conversation that the deceased had not known of the guarantee for very long. 
     
      
    30 Additionally he said, the deceased had made mention of his concerns in relation to the way in which the Excell business was being run and to his belief that he was not earning the sort of money he should have been receiving.31 There was evidence from Ms Johnson to the effect that, on 6 June, the deceased had informed her that he was due to meet with the appellant, at Excell, at 7:30 PM. Mr Skinner said that the appellant had left his house at about 7 PM, after first phoning Ms Johnson, and arranging to pick her up later.32 There was also evidence from Mr Douglas to the effect that the appellant had informed him, on 6 June, that there was going to be meeting with the deceased, that night at Excell's office. He confirmed having seen the appellant at these premises at about 6:45 PM, as did Mr Milner, who said that he saw the appellant and the deceased there, along with Mr Cowie and another man.33 Finally, in this context, there was evidence of calls having made on the appellant's mobile phone to the deceased during the afternoon of 6 June, at 1:36 PM and to 2:12 PM.34 In a statement made to police on 15 June 2000 the appellant said that he had a 50-50 partnership with the deceased in Excell, and that the latter received a monthly dividend of $350. He claimed that the meeting on 6 June had been amicable, and that he had been surprised by the disappearance of the deceased since he had been clearing his debts, and was in a good relationship with his girlfriend.35 Mr Donnachie said that at some time, on or after 8 June, the appellant described the meeting to him in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""we had a fight which is not unusual for me and Graeme [the deceased]. It wasn't anything spectacular but yep, it was fine."" 
        
       
       
      The fact of ""the fight"" was not mentioned to police by the appellant when he made his statement. 
       
      
    36 Ms Johnson also described asking the appellant, a few days after the disappearance, how the meeting had gone. He said that everything was fine, and that they had discussed two issues. One was a performance guarantee of $160,000 to $180,000 which was required by Chubb in relation to a contract for the Olympic period, for which he had secured a loan source. The second issue related to the prospect of Excell taking over the Workwatch business in which the deceased was involved. She said that, prior to this discussion, she had never heard any mention of these matters from the deceased or from anyone else.37 She also said that the appellant suggested that the deceased may have done a runner because of pressure, and that he had been known to do that in the past. In this regard there were some evidence from other witnesses, although that was not accepted by Ms Johnson, that he had, at times, been unreliable, and had gone missing for a few days, or had not reported for security jobs. Evidence of this kind came from Mr Rodriguez, Geoffrey Clarke, James Douglas, and Mr Skinner. 
     
      
       
        
        (ii) The appellant’s inquiry of Mr Thompson as to whether he could supply him with some sub-sonic .22 calibre ammunition. 
        
       
      
    38 James Douglas gave evidence that a number of firearms were kept at the office of Excell, and were locked in a safe. None were of .22 calibre, and none were capable of firing a cartridge of this calibre.39 Mr Thompson, the Excell Training and Marketing Co-ordinator, gave evidence that before he began to work with Excell in April 2000, he was asked by the appellant if he had any subsonic .22 ammunition, as he wished to shoot rabbits at his father's property at Glenorie. Mr Thompson said that such ammunition has a lower velocity and does not make the ""crack"" sound that is otherwise generated by a rifle or a pistol. He said that he supplied this ammunition before beginning to work at Excell, and also brought in other ammunition, including .22 calibre rounds, which were kept in the firearms room. He was not able to place the date of the subsonic ammunition discussion with any degree of certainty.40 Mr Thomson gave evidence of a further very curious conversation which he had with the appellant, after the disappearance of the deceased, in which the appellant asked him if he knew of any friendly firearms dealers who could make it appear that firearms held by Excell were not on the premises at the time of the appellant's disappearance; and also whether firearms could be altered to make it appear as if a round fired from such a firearm had in fact been fired from another weapon. It was his response that this could be done but that it would be obvious.41 In cross-examination, he agreed that police had attended at Excell's premises in relation to inquiries concerning the robbery of an armoured van, in the course of which there were indications that the guns in Excell’s safe would need to be examined, and taken away to be tested, and that the appellant had expressed concern that if they were taken away, or confiscated, then the business would be unable to operate.42 Mr Thomson was an accredited firearm trainer, and he had conducted various courses, one of which had been attended by the appellant in December 1999. He said that students were trained to shoot at the centre of the largest part of their target. He said that he had been taught to explain that there may be better targets on the body, but that they were not ideal because they were small, fast moving and difficult to hit. The specific area which he said he demonstrated in this regard, was the area behind the head, just below the ears, that is, the area coinciding with the brainstem. In cross examination he explained that he had mentioned it, not to encourage the selection of this area as a target, but more to obviate questions that might flow from impressions which had been gained from watching movies, and to ensure that students avoided getting into trouble themselves by missing their target. He acknowledged that shooting someone in the brainstem was a very effective way of killing.43 Mr Douglas said that he had attended courses conducted by Mr Thompson, but had no recollection of any reference being made to the brainstem as being a good place to shoot someone. Additionally he said that he saw no occasion for a security guard needing to shoot someone in the back of the head.44 The evidence relating to the appellant's request to Mr Douglas for the supply of .22 ammunition, and the evidence which suggested that the fatal shot was of this calibre, were relied upon by the Crown to show premeditation and planning on the part of the appellant. In particular it was put that since the weapons kept at Excell in connection with its business were not of this calibre, then it followed that a .22 calibre firearm must have been brought to the meeting, for the purpose of being used that night. 
     
      
       
        
        (iii) The appellant’s purchase of some galvanised chain and D-shackles of the kind that were found wrapped around the body of the deceased 
        
       
      
    45 The appellant made a formal admission that, on 30 May 2000, he had purchased 15 metres of 3/8 sized galvanised chain, and five 12 mm D- shackles from Matthew Weinecke of Hardware and General, Brookvale. He gave his name as Simon, and made the purchase on the account of Absolute Property Improvements. There was evidence to the effect that he was the proprietor of this business and that the details supplied to the vendor in support of the establishment of a monthly credit account coincided with his personal details. A carbon copy of the purchase invoice was found at the office of Excell.46 Mr Weinecke had asserted in his original statement that he recalled cutting the chain which had been purchased into three lengths, but subsequently corrected this to say that he could only remember cutting it once. He suggested that he may have confused the transaction first described, with the sale to a young manager from McDonald's who wanted the chains to stop customers entering the car park after hours. One person fitting that description (Daniel Peacock) was found, but it was his evidence that the 5/16 galvanised chain which he had purchased on 31 March 2000 had not been cut. It was his evidence that although he had ordered 15 m of chain he had in fact received chain to the length of about 19 m. He said that he had required it to rope off the back section of the car park. He also said that the salesman had used a measuring stick. He had not ordered any D-shackles.47 By the time Mr Weinecke gave evidence he had served very many customers, and he had no independent recollection of the transaction. He had initially informed police that his standard method for measuring chain was to estimate one metre by holding one end of the chain at the middle of his chest and stretching the chain to the end of his outstretched arm. Further lengths were measured by doubling the chain over himself in that manner. There was some evidence from Detective Senior Constable Woutersz that a replication of this exercise resulted in a length of 1.1 metres rather than 1 metre. 
     
      
    48 Mr Weinecke, on another occasion, had indicated that he had used a measuring stick to measure out the necessary length of chain. It followed that his evidence was somewhat uncertain in relation to the length of chain in fact delivered, although it seems from the evidence of Detective Woutersz and Mr Peacock that his measurements tended to be somewhat generous, and not inconsistent with him having sold the two lengths of chain that were found wrapped around the deceased. 49 There was evidence from Desmond Ebejer, to the effect that his company, SPL Group Limited, imported and distributed chain of the subject kind to the hardware industry, and that the wholesale value of all of the chains, which it distributed, including those of the same size as that sold to the appellant, which was the heaviest stocked, was in excess of $1 million per year. The D-shackles, he said, were of a standard type sold in retail hardware stores.  
     
      
    50 A mild steel D-shackle of similar size and pattern to that found on the chains wrapped around the deceased, although somewhat shinier, was found attached to the tow bar of the appellant's Holden Rodeo utility. Mr Ebejer was of the view that this shackle had been zinc plated rather than hot dip galvanised. 51 David Bubb, a builder employed by Absolute Property Improvements, gave evidence to the effect that his name had been written on some of the invoices for purchases from Hardware and General that were found during the police search of the Excell premises, although that of the appellant was written on the invoice for the 30 May sale. He said that the appellant had never to his knowledge ordered materials for the business, and that there had never been an occasion when he had required the use of heavy chain or shackles.52 James Douglas, who was employed to do labouring work for Absolute Property Improvements, gave evidence that its equipment was stored at Glenorie and that he had no recollection of seeing any chain or shackles there.53 Paul Bettridge, who worked part-time for the company sometime between June and August 2000 said that he recalled seeing a length of heavy duty chain in a heap in the work shop area of the Excell premises, at Chatswood.54 Melanie Kristeller had a conversation with the appellant, on 29 August 2000, which was recorded by police following the execution of a search warrant at Excell’s premises. It appears that she was reading from the list of documents, which had been seized and left at the office. She mentioned the 30 May receipt, and asked if the appellant had ever purchased any chain. It was his answer that he had not done so since the time when he had been building boats, 10 years previously. As noted later this conversation occurred at a time when the appellant suspected that his mobile phone and the Excell office were bugged.  
     
      
       
        
        (iv) The rental by the appellant of a small aluminium boat 
        
       
      
    55 It was the Crown case that the appellant had rented this boat from Hornsby Marine shortly before 6 June. Mr Herbert the proprietor of that business, gave evidence that he had one 3.8 m aluminium boat, with a 6 horse power outboard motor with three seats, including a removable middle seat, available for hire. It had written on its side ""Hornsby Boats” and “Hire Me for $35"".56 When he was spoken to by police, in August 2000, Mr Herbert had no recollection of any person, matching the appellant's description, having rented this boat. He had been unable to find any details concerning its hiring, but acknowledged that his bookkeeping was haphazard. The hire charge for it, he said, varied from $50 to $70. It was his practice to obtain identification such as the hirer’s Drivers Licence number and a credit card number for security, and to write down the hirer’s details. He also said that he would put 500 ml of two-stroke fuel into the boat and then leave it to the owner to fill the tank with petrol.57 During a clean out of his motor vehicle, in April 2001, he found a flyer under the seat, in his hand writing, which recorded ""tinny hire Simon Wilkinson 31 Brooker Avenue Beacon Hill 8870DP AMP AMX 377 831 767 61004 5/00 5/3 $50."" Mr Herbert notified police. 31 Brooker Avenue was the appellant's residential address, and the AMEX card number, and the licence number, coincided with the card and licence issued to him.58 The $50 recorded on this document Mr Herbert believed had indicated a booking or holding deposit.59 In cross-examination he did not accept that the appellant had been to Hornsby Marine more than once, or that the $50 was a quoted hiring rate. It was put to him that the appellant had expressed an interest in buying a boat, and that as a result he had agreed that he would let him hire the boat for a day, for $50. He said, in reply, that he would have only done that if the appellant had been interested in buying a ""tinny"".60 During a search of the appellant's Holden Rodeo utility a post-it note was found which noted the address and phone numbers of Hornsby Marine. There was also evidence of call charge records which showed that a number of calls had been made from Excell to Hornsby Marine on 29 and 30 May 2000. Another post-it note found in the vehicle noted the address of the deceased and the words “desk, chair, bookcase, bar fridge, all else”. 61 There was, additionally, evidence from David Bubb, a builder employed by Absolute Property Improvements, to the effect that he had seen a small aluminium outboard boat and trailer in the workshop at Warrah Street Chatswood, in the ""last week of May, first week of June 2000"" for a few days. That boat, he said, was somewhat scratched and dented, with registration numbers or paint work on its side, and looked similar to the one depicted in a photograph, that was available for hire from Hornsby Marine, although he had acknowledged that it was a very common kind of boat. One afternoon, at about 5 PM, he said he saw it attached to the appellant’s Holden Rodeo utility, as he drove back to the premises. On the following day he said it was not there. 62 There was also evidence from James Douglas and Melanie Kristeller to the effect that they had seen a small boat, or a tin runabout, on a trailer, at the Excell office complex before 7 June. Stephen Thomson similarly said that he had seen a small aluminium boat at Excell, with a small outboard motor, around 6 horse power. He described it as having appeared to be new and in good condition, with three seats. A photo of the Hornsby Marine boat was shown to him. He said that it was a similar vessel, although it appeared older and less well kept. These sightings he placed, at the committal, ""around the period of late April, possibly through to May."", although at trial he indicated that he was not sure of the exact date.63 There was evidence to suggest that the appellant had an interest in boats, and the Excell search turned up several boating magazines, including one called ""Trailer Boat"". 
     
      
      (b) The Movements of the Appellant on the Night of 6 June 
       
      
    64 Of considerable relevance was the evidence relating to the whereabouts, and conduct of the appellant, after 9:30 PM. 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The appellant’s purchase of fuel and other items at 9:25 PM, and his departure from the Excell office at 9:58 PM. 
        
       
      
    65 The appellant admitted at the trial that at 9:25 PM he had used his Star Card account at the Caltex service station, Lane Cove, to purchased 63.05 litres of petrol, two bottles of Lucozade, one bottle of Coke, 230 grams of chips, some mints, a packet of Benson & Hedges cigarettes, and one packet of Winfield red cigarettes. This admission was supported by the service station records.66 There was evidence that Mr Cowie preferred to smoke Winfield red cigarettes, that the appellant smoked Benson and Hedges, and that each drank Coke at work.67 It was the Crown case that the appellant had made these purchases after the deceased was killed, in preparation for the trip that was needed to dispose of the body, and then returned to Excell to attach the boat to the utility and to load the body in it. It was its case that having attended to these matters he left the Excell premises with Mr Cowie after activating the security alarm, using his code CI, at 9:58 PM, as recorded on the Central Monitoring Log.68 Both Mr Milner and Ms Kristeller gave evidence to the effect that after hours calls to Excell diverted to Mr Milner's mobile, it being his responsibility to attend various sites and to respond to alarm calls. His records for the night of 6 June show that he attended sites in response to alarm calls at 7:40 PM, at 8:02 PM, 8:35 PM, and 9 PM, as well as a call for another company at Chatswood Post Office. As a result, he was absent from the Excell office until 11:03 PM at which time the Central Monitoring records logged him de-activating the Excell alarm, which had previously been activated by the appellant at 9:58 PM.69 He confirmed that while on his rounds he had received a call from Ms Johnson wanting his help in locating the deceased or the appellant, and that, after his return to Excell, he had phoned her back with the appellant's phone number. He also said that after receiving her call he had tried unsuccessfully to contact the appellant, and had left a message on his pager, at 11:05 PM. Although there was not any degree of certainty about it, Mr Milner did have a recollection of returning to the office briefly after having left Excell on his rounds at 7:20 PM, and of thinking that the meeting must have been brief, as there was no one there. However there was no evidence of him returning and having de-activated or activated the alarm before the appellant’s return.70 The call charge records for the appellant's phone showed that at 9:45 PM, that is, 13 minutes or so before he activated the Excell alarm, he made a call to the Excell landline, which registered at the Chatswood tower. It was the Crown case that this call was made by the appellant, with the knowledge that it would divert to Mr Milner's phone, and that his intention had been to make sure that he did not return to Excell while the appellant was leaving from there, with the boat, and the body of the deceased. 
     
      
       
        
        (ii) Mobile phone calls pointing to the presence of the appellant in the vicinity of the Hawkesbury River and Brooklyn. 
        
       
      
    71 Two conversations are of relevance in this context. The first of these occurred at 10:51 PM on 6 June 2000. On that occasion, a 39 second call was made from the appellant's mobile phone to the deceased's mobile phone. That latter phone was not working having been previously damaged. There was evidence that the deceased used the SIM card normally associated with it, from time to time on other mobile phones. The SIM card could also be used to receive messages. 72 This call was registered through the Mount White tower, which was shown to be capable of picking up calls in an arc extending up to 35 km, including the expressway area to the south of that tower. It was the Crown case that this call had been made by the appellant, while driving North on the expressway towards the Hawkesbury River, and had been for the purpose of checking whether the deceased's mobile phone was still on his person.73 There was evidence to the effect that a 39 second call would have been consistent with the caller having listened to a message on the service called, and then hanging up without leaving a message, or with the caller having left a message of the necessary duration. Neither of these alternatives could be proved since left messages are routinely deleted after five days or so. So far as the evidence shows the deceased's mobile phone was never found.74 The second call of relevance was made from Mr Cowie's mobile phone, to the mobile of Ms Johnson at 2:55 AM on 7 June 2000. This call was registered at the Brooklyn tower. Evidence was led to the effect that this Tower’s coverage was very insular, the dominant coverage area comprising Mooney Mooney and Brooklyn.75 It was the Crown case that this call had been made by the appellant, returning a call which had been made by Ms Johnson to his paging service at 2:04 AM. That call had been made by Ms Johnson following the failure of the deceased to keep his meeting with her at 9:30 PM, and her failure to make contact with him on his home service at 9:15 PM, 9:47 PM and 10:42 PM. She had also attended his house; and had phoned Excell at 10:08 and 10:45, on which occasions she had asked Mr Milner for the appellant's mobile number, which she did not receive until 1 AM.76 Ms Johnson said that in the 2:55 AM conversation, the appellant confirmed that he had met with the deceased indicating that this had occurred at the Pizzeria in Willoughby Road. He had added, on her account, that he had known that the deceased had been due to meet her at 9:30 AM, because he kept looking at his watch. This, she said, she realised was untrue because the deceased did not wear a watch. 77 She said that the appellant also informed her that he had walked the deceased to his car after they had left the Pizzeria. He invited her to phone him in the morning if the deceased did not turn up.78 At 6:28 on the morning of 7 June she phoned the appellant and left a message on his paging service. He returned the call, using his mobile, at 6:56 AM and, on Ms Johnson's account, repeated that they had eaten at a pizza restaurant on Willoughby Road. This call registered on the Crows Nest tower which, on the Crown case, was consistent with the appellant having made the call after having driven back from the Hawkesbury River. 
     
      
    79 Later that day several more calls were made by the appellant, using his mobile, which the Crown contended were consistent with him taking steps to return the boat to Hornsby Marine after using it to dump the body. They were as follows: 
     
      
      a) 3:53 PM, call to Matthew Donnachie, which registered on the Northbridge tower; 
       
      b) 3:54 PM and 4:46 PM call to Excell, which registered on the Northbridge tower; 
       
      c) 4:52 PM call to Ms Johnson, which also registered on the Northbridge tower; 
       
      d) 6:04 and 6:25 PM calls to Excell which registered on the Roseville and Wahroonga Towers; and 
       
      e) 6:27 PM call to Hornsby Marine. 
       
      
    80 There was evidence of various calls that were made to Excell on the morning and afternoon of 7 June, by persons who sought unsuccessfully to speak to the appellant. They included Mr Donnachie, Ms Kristeller, and Ms Johnson. The pager records of the appellant show that messages were left for him by Ms Kristeller at 9:07, 10:59, 14:53, 16:44 and 18:36. 81 The fact that he was uncontactable, and had not been to the office that morning, was relied upon by the Crown as being consistent with him having had a late night. There was, however, evidence to suggest that it was not uncommon for him to arrive at the office in the late afternoon. 
     
      
       
        
        (iii) Did the appellant and the deceased have a meal at a pizzeria after their meeting? 
        
       
      
    82 As has been noted earlier, it was Ms Johnson's recollection that the appellant described having a pizza with the deceased at a restaurant in Willoughby Road.83 There was evidence from Ms Kristeller and, that she had made several attempts to contact the appellant on the morning of 7 June by leaving messages on his paging service. It was not until the afternoon that she was able to contact him, at which time he mentioned having last seen the deceased in the vicinity of his car, which he had parked across the corner from the pizzeria on Willoughby Road, near the Willoughby hotel.84 Karen Jones gave evidence that a week after the deceased’s disappearance, the appellant had indicated that he had apparently been the last person to see him. He said that they had eaten a pizza together and that he had paid for it.85 The post mortem examination showed that there was no food present in the stomach of the deceased. Dr Langlois gave evidence that, due to the fat content of a pizza, he would expect it to remain in the stomach for at least a couple of hours, and up to an hour or more if half a pizza were consumed.86 When Detective Sergeant Brown spoke to the appellant on 15 June, he was informed by him that the deceased had come to his office at Excell at 7:30 PM. He said that they had gone to Anto’s Pizzeria in Penshurst Street Chatswood where they had dinner, and discussed the wishes of the deceased, who he described as having a 50% interest in Excell, to become more involved in the business, the finance needed for an upcoming Olympic contract, and the prospect of incorporating Workwatch, another of the deceased's business interests, into Excell.87 In this account, the appellant said that they had remained at the restaurant until 10 PM, that he had walked the deceased to his car, which was parked in McMahon Street, around the corner from the restaurant. Having done that he returned to his own vehicle. The deceased, he said, was wearing a black beanie, a jumper and sheepskin gloves. The assertion that the two men remained at the Pizzeria until 10 PM, the Crown claimed, must also have been untrue, having regard to the visit to the Caltex Service Station at Lane Cove. Moreover, the Crown contended that it was significant that the deceased had not tried to phone Ms Johnson after attending Excell’s premises in view of his arrangement to meet her, suggesting that he had been killed before 9:30 PM.88 On 5 July the appellant went to Anto’s Pizzeria with police, and pointed out the location where he and the deceased had parked their vehicles. The owner of Anto’s, Hagop Gulumian, and an employee Shahan Rajoyan, gave evidence of recalling a very tall man attending the pizzeria at about 7:30 to 8:00 PM, by himself, and consuming the $6 pizza special. Mr Gulumian said that this was not the man whom he had seen with police outside the Pizzeria on 5 July. Further, he said, the man he saw was different from the man depicted in the photograph of the deceased which was shown to him. He also said that by 9:30 PM, on 6 June, everyone had left the Pizzeria.89 Mr Rajoyan described the man who had attended the Pizzeria as having blonde hair. He said however that he was wearing a green army jacket, with a blue shirt, and a tie with yellow dots. He also said that the man was not the same man as that shown in the photograph of the deceased, although there were some similarities as to hair colour and length.90 It was common ground that the deceased had a distinctive appearance, being 6 foot 8 inches tall, 100 Kgs or more in weight and with spiky bleached blonde hair and eyebrows and that the appellant was of a similar height. The circumstance of two men of such an exceptional height attending the Pizzeria together, the Crown submitted, would inevitably have attracted attention and not been forgotten, especially if they had remained there until 10 PM.  
     
      
    91 Mr Skinner, who saw the appellant at 7 PM on 6 June, said that he was wearing a white/cream wool jumper, a blue business shirt, light brown slacks, and reddish brown shoes with a chunky sole. His hair, he had earlier described as having a ""5 o'clock shadow"". The clothes that were found on the body of the deceased matched this description, providing further support for the proposition that he was killed that night.  
     
      
       
        
        (iv) Mr Cowie’s presence 
        
       
      
    92 It was the Crown case that Mr Cowie was present during the meeting, and afterwards, and that he had been needed to assist in moving the body of the deceased because of the size of the latter.93 In this regard it relied on the use of his telephone by the appellant to make the 2:55 AM telephone call to Ms Johnson. It also relied on the call charge records which showed that at 3:47 AM, a call was placed from his mobile to his voice mail which also registered on the Brooklyn tower. This appears to have been a response to a voice mail message that had been left for him at 6:40 PM but not notified to his mobile phone until 2:54 AM, either because it had been switched off, or because it had been out of range.94 Mr Douglas said that, as he was leaving on the night of June, at a time which he fixed as 6:45 PM or possibly 7:15 PM, he saw the deceased in the entrance area. The appellant, he said, was coming out of his office, and Mr Cowie was nearby. The appellant asked him to give Mr Cowie a lift to Chatswood railway station. He refused because he was tired, and the appellant said that he would drive him there himself.95 Robert Milner, an Excell security guard, who was working the night shift from 5 PM on 6 June, said that when he arrived at the office he also saw the appellant, Mr Cowie and another male near the reception area. The appellant said that they were having a meeting. Sometime later he saw the deceased go into the appellant's office.96 There was also some evidence from Mr Thompson concerning Mr Cowie's financial dealings with the appellant. It was to the effect that Mr Cowie was paid in a manner that differed from that applicable to other employees who were not being paid regularly. Mr Thomson became aware, through a sheet of paper, and an observation made by the appellant before 6 June, that Mr Cowie owed moneys either to Excell or to the appellant.97 There was also some evidence from Mr Milner that, at sometime after 6 June, the appellant asked him to deliver some money to Mr Cowie, and that, on another occasion, he was asked to deliver an envelope to him, which he believed contained money. An intercepted conversation between the appellant and Mr Cowie after the killing recorded a discussion in relation to a debt of about $4000 which was asserted to be outstanding from Mr Cowie to the appellant. The appellant admitted, that from 21 August 2000, he had suspected that the police might have bugged his mobile, and that after the 22 August search of Excell, he believed that the office at those premises was bugged. 
     
      
       
      (v) The discovery of the deceased’s motor vehicle  
       
      
    98 There was evidence to the effect that, on 26 June 2000, the deceased’s motor vehicle was found in Parkside Lane, Chatswood, by Council rangers. There was a lot of dust on its roof and windscreen, and an accumulation of debris and leaves under the back wheels, consistent with it having been there for sometime. However, it was free of any parking tickets which might have been expected to have been issued, had it been observed by a ranger policing the residential parking restrictions which were in place. Additionally, a local resident indicated that he had seen it on 25 June, and thought it unlikely that it had been there for two weeks or so, as he would have expected to have noticed it earlier, if that had been the case.99 Former Detective Sergeant Brown gave evidence that it appeared to have been wiped clean of fingerprints. Senior Constable McGovern, who conducted a fingerprint examination, confirmed that he had found no fingerprints, either inside or outside the vehicle, not even on the glass surfaces. This he considered to be unusual, notwithstanding the depredation expected over time if a vehicle was left outside because he would have expected smudge marks to be evident both on the interior and exterior of the vehicle.100 When the vehicle was searched on 29 June, police found a Gregory's street directory in the glove box. The left index fingerprint of Mr Cowie was found on the far right hand edge of Map 284 of the directory. That map included Parkside Lane, while the map on the following page included Warrah St where the Excell office was located. The fingerprint was consistent with the turning of the page, and it was the Crown case that Mr Cowie had driven the car to this location, which is to be found on the way from the Excell address to the Lane Cove service station, after the deceased had been killed, and had used the book for directions. It was also the Crown case that the appellant picked him up from this location before driving on to the service station. 101 There was some evidence from Mr Donachie that Mr Cowie had, on occasions, driven with the deceased for insurance surveillance activities. However there had not been an occasion when they had driven into the Chatswood area for this purpose. 
     
      
      (c) The Existence of a Motive  
       
      
    102 In addition to the material previously noted concerning the expressed wish of the appellant to have a greater involvement in Excell, and his attempts to gain access to its financial records, there was some evidence which went to the question whether the appellant was concealing aspects of its business from him, or was otherwise operating the business to his disadvantage.  
     
      
    103 This had a relevance, additionally, in the light of the financial difficulties which the deceased was having at the time, which provided a reason for him to seek some greater involvement in, and return from, the company.  
     
      
    104 In this regard there was independent evidence of the appellant having been in financial difficulties, as well as having been involved in a marital dispute with his former wife Suzanne Rose, who claimed that he owed moneys to her. The documents recovered from his home included letters of demand and overdue accounts, and there was some evidence to suggest that he had become depressed to the point of receiving psychiatric assistance.  
     
      
    105 In addition there was evidence in relation to the collapse of the Blue Falcon Security business, and to the fact that the deceased had become liable for its debts. He had mentioned these problems to his solicitor Christopher Finn, to whom he also owed some moneys. Further, he made arrangements, on 4 June 2000 to borrow $4000 from Mr Skinner to pay for the registration of his car, which had lapsed in January, and to move house, pending the receipt of some moneys from his father.  
     
      
    106 There were, upon the evidence, several possible areas for contention, between the deceased and the appellant at the meeting, relating to the deceased’s express wish to have a greater interest in the business and more information concerning it, the moneys which he was owed in relation to Blue Falcon and needed, because of his financial problems, the request for a guarantee to be signed at a time when the appellant needed assistance for the Olympic contract which he had wished to keep for himself, and his desire to bring the Workwatch business into Excell. Some of these aspects require further amplification.  
     
      
      Access to Financial Information 
      
    107 The evidence showed that, following the failure of Falcon Blue in 1999, the contracts of its employees had been renewed by Excell. There was evidence from a number of witnesses, including Mr Douglas, to the effect that the deceased had taken steps to avoid these staff members becoming aware of his involvement in the Excell business, which was managed on a day-to-day basis by the appellant. 108 Mr Thomson gave evidence that he was informed by the appellant, in May 2000, that by reason of the Blue Falcon problems, the deceased had agreed to stay out of the Excell business for 12 months, which period was about to expire. He also said that he did not want Mr Thomson discussing the operations of the business, with the deceased. At this time, he said, locks were placed on the door to the appellant's office, as well as to the door to the office which was shared by him and Mr Douglas. Additionally, he said, a direction was given that the doors were to be kept locked overnight, as well as at any time that the deceased was expected to attend the premises. The deceased, Mr Thompson said, was not given a key to the office, of the appellant, or to that which he shared with Mr Douglas, or an alarm code for the premises. On one occasion, he said, when the deceased arrived at the office before the appellant, he was instructed by the latter, who he phoned, to tell him to wait outside. 
     
      
    109 Mr Douglas, however, gave as a reason for the lock to his office, that this was done for the security of the gun locker or safe. Ms Kristeller said that she was unaware of any suggestion by the appellant to the effect that the deceased should be locked out of the premises or prevented from accessing Excell’s books, or that its activities should be kept secret from him. 110 Karen Jones, who was employed as the Excell business manager, said that she understood that Excell owed the deceased approximately $35,000, by way of a loan, after having bought the Blue Falcon business across. The appellant, she said, had asked her, at some stage, how much was owed. Christopher Finn said that on 11 April 2000 the deceased had indicated that he was owed about $18,000 by Excell, and that he expected to receive some money from it, at which time the outstanding legal fees would be paid. 
     
      
      Workwatch 
       
      
    111 Mr Kron gave evidence that, in late 1998, he and the deceased established this business, which was designed to secure employment for graduates from the Secta training academy, where the deceased was employed as a part time lecturer. It was his account that it was about to be incorporated at the time that the deceased went missing, and that although it had not generated any substantial earnings by June 2000, he thought that it had considerable potential, particularly as the Olympics were approaching.112 He said that he and the deceased had asked Mr Cowie to design a web page for it. His failure to do so, he said, led to a heated argument at a hotel between the deceased and Mr Cowie, which left the former fuming. The deceased, he said, reluctantly agreed, later, to having Mr Cowie back, but his continued unreliability led to him being replaced. This occurred before the disappearance of the deceased. He indicated, however, that subsequently there had been something of a reconciliation, in that the three men had met at a hotel to have a drink together. 113 Mr Kron said that the bulk of the Workwatch material was placed on the computer of the deceased at his house. After his disappearance he had that information downloaded, before the computer was taken, with his consent, by the appellant.114 Later, he said, he saw the computer at Excell, and was informed by the appellant that he wanted the Workwatch files. When he replied that they had been downloaded, he was informed by the appellant that the deceased had spoken to him about moving Workwatch to Excell. Mr Kron said that he reacted with disbelief, since the deceased had made no mention of this to him. All that the deceased had mentioned, in the context of Excell, was that he expected it to be a client of Workwatch. 
     
      
    115 The appellant, he said, asked for the access codes at this meeting. When Mr Kron tried to contact him after the body of the deceased had been found, to discuss the matter further, he did not call him back. Mr Kron also said that the appellant indicated that he was keeping the possessions which he had taken from the deceased's house in satisfaction of a debt of $2500 which he claimed was owed to him.116 It also came as a surprise to Ms Johnson when the appellant mentioned to her that, at the 6 June meeting, he had discussed the transfer of the Workwatch business to Excell. She added that, within the following week, the appellant offered his warehouse to store the deceased's belongings. She recalled him asking for the computer and files relating to Workwatch. She told him that he needed to speak to Mr Kron and understood that he had given his approval. She first removed the deceased's personal files including those relating to Workwatch. On 20 June, she said, the appellant and Mr Douglas came to the deceased's house and took the computer, and Workwatch files along with the fax machine, answering machine, filing cabinet and some other items. 
     
      
    117 Ms Kristeller, however, said that the deceased had expressed an interest in February or March 2000 about Workwatch being involved with Excell, and had discussed that with the appellant. 
     
      
      The Olympic Contract 
       
      
    118 The general manager of the Olympics Division of Chubb Security, Terence Crotty, gave evidence of the tender which was advertised in July 1999, seeking expressions of interest for the provision of security guards for the Sydney Olympic Games. A tender was submitted by the appellant on behalf of Excell, in relation to the two month “Alliance period” between 1 September 2000 and the end of the Paralympics. It was the Crown case that the appellant had kept this proposal, and the contract that was later entered into with Chubb on 6 January 2000, a secret from the deceased. In that regard a copy of the document addressed to ""Dear potential employee"", and headed ""Olympic employment opportunities"", was found at the office of Excell, which noted that any queries concerning it could be addressed to the appellant, or to Mr Thomson or Mr Douglas. There was no mention of the deceased, even though he was the controlling 51 percent shareholder in the business.119 The value of the contract was $1,621,534.80 and Excell was required to provide a 15 percent bank guarantee ($243,230) to protect Chubb in the event of it failing to meet its contractual obligations. The appellant requested a revision of the contract to $1,677,030 because of GST, and a reduction of the guarantee to 10 percent ($167,703). The contract was subject to the provision of the bank guarantee, which was never provided. It required the provision of 70 guards on weekdays and 60 on weekends during the alliance period. Mr Thompson said that the appellant had informed him that the contract would deliver profits in the order of $300,000 to $400,000. 120 In May 2000, NBC began to carry out work on the Olympics site. Chubb subcontracted Excell to provide three to four guards per day for this purpose. When guards began to fail to appear, Chubb became concerned about Excell’s ability to perform the contract for the Alliance period. It was also concerned in relation to the non provision of the guarantee. It was shown that invoices were submitted to Chubb, commencing with the week ending 24 May, and for the subsequent weeks up to the time of the deceased’s disappearance, in weekly sums of $4450. 
     
      
    121 Mr Donachie gave evidence that, in March 2000, the appellant spoke to him in relation to the Chubb contract. He said that he needed finance for wages, uniforms and the security bond. He sent the contract to Mr Donachie for perusal. Mr Donachie said that he did not speak to the deceased about it, even though he was one of his best friends.  
     
      
    122 Steve Lawton (a finance broker) gave evidence that in April 2000 he was given a number of documents by the appellant, via Mr Donachie. It included a statement of the appellant's assets and liabilities, his tax returns for 1997 and 1998, the financial statement for the period 1 July 1999 to 30 March 2000, and the Chubb contract.123 He then prepared a preliminary or draft spreadsheet, showing profit and cash flow projections for May to December 2000 in respect of the Olympic contract, upon the basis of the information supplied. The spreadsheet was faxed to the appellant, but was never submitted to any financial institution because Mr Lawton was waiting for further information from the appellant which did not arrive. He agreed that the actual invoices sent to Chubb by Excell were significantly less than those anticipated on the spreadsheet.124 Karen Jones gave evidence that Excell had little money, that paydays were stressful and the Group Tax was not being paid. She was made redundant on 8 December 1999 when cost cuts were made. She warned the deceased in February 2000, that the company was practically insolvent.125 Mr Thomson gave evidence that a factoring company (Scottish Pacific)had been engaged in June by Excell in order to provide the necessary moneys to float the project, and that this had also led to cash flow problems, as it received the payments for the guards. Mr Crotty was informed of its appointment in June.126 Mr Thomson said that he had a number of discussions with the appellant in relation to the project, which the latter felt should be separated from the normal operations of Excell because of the effort he had put into gaining the contract. This was relied upon by the Crown to show that at 6 June the appellant still regarded the project as viable.127 Further evidence to show that the contract was still potentially on foot at that time was provided by the fact that, on 27 June, Mr Thomson assisted the appellant with an application for finance, and by the fact that in August 2000 Chubb advised that it was limiting Excell's work to the Olympic games period, for which it would be paid $615,000. The contract was eventually terminated on 5 September 2000, as a result of Excell's nonperformance.128 Together these matters were relied upon to show that by 6 June 2000, the appellant had a motive to kill the deceased, by reason of his desire to keep the Olympic contract away from him, and by reason of the likely confrontation that would arise at the meeting.129 There was on the other hand some evidence from the former wife of the deceased, as well as from Karen James, Melanie Kristeller, Michael Rodriguez and James Douglas that they had been unaware of any animosity having been expressed or shown between the appellant and the deceased. Moreover, the appellant contended, the evidence showed that he had been open in relation to the Olympic contract, to the point of discussing it with a person whom he knew to be a close friend of the deceased. There was also some evidence from Mr Kron, to suggest that the deceased had been aware of the Olympic contract before 6 June.  
     
      
      (d) Other Suspects 
       
      
    130 The appellant raised, through cross-examination, the possibility of other persons, in particular those who had been partners of the deceased in Falcon Blue, having been responsible for the killing, because of the bad blood that had developed between them, following, or at the time of, its failure in 1999.131 Those partners were Andrew King and Peter Murrant.132 Ms Johnson said that the deceased had expressed concern that his partners in that venture had been taking money from the business, and had attributed the blame for its collapse on that alleged fact. She said however, that he had never expressed any fears concerning them.133 There was evidence to the effect that the deceased had little idea of the way in which to run the business, that employees and bills had not been paid on time, and that superannuation payments had not been made for a number of years.134 In March 1998, it was shown, the deceased had requested his accountant, Erik de Hart to carry out an audit.135 Additionally he had expressed concerns to friends and associates in relation to the Police Integrity Commission inquiry into the practice of police moonlighting as security guards, and in relation to his belief that he was being deceived by his partners.136 In the second half of 1999, it appears that he was interviewed by Police Internal Affairs concerning the moonlighting problem, and concerning Blue Falcon’s activities, in the course of which Mr Murrant’s name had been mentioned.137 Each of Messrs Murrant and King had in fact resigned from Blue Falcon by April 1999, and the deceased was advised in due course, to cease trading by reason of the financial difficulties in which the business found itself. As noted elsewhere, this left him in the position where he was liable for its debts, including some claims by persons who claimed to have been injured at premises guarded by it.138 These problems were discussed by the deceased with his solicitor, Christopher Finn, and also with his accountant Mr de Hart.139 He indicated to the former, on 11 April 2000, that he had problems with his overall indebtedness, including a MasterCard debt of $25,000 which he believed to have been Mr King’s responsibility, as well as some other residual debts of the business. He indicated that, while he could not pay the legal fees due to Mr Finn, he hoped to receive some money soon.140 During April he informed his accountant that his former partners did not trust him because they believed that he had given information against Mr Murrant to the Police Integrity Commission, that he was worried about what Mr Murrant might do, and also that he thought he was being followed to see if he was, in fact, supplying information.141 There was evidence from Mr Rodriguez, a financial consultant and former security guard with Blue Falcon that on one occasion, while the Blue Falcon business was still operating, there had been a physical altercation between the deceased and Mr King following a discussion about the cash flow, and the problems with superannuation payments.142 Richard Skinner, a friend of the deceased, gave evidence to the effect that the relationship between the former partners had been “strained”, and that there were bad feelings, but it was his impression that this came more from the deceased. Suzanne Rose, the deceased's former wife, gave evidence to similar effect as to the ill feeling which had developed towards the end of the business, which had led the deceased to feel bitter. She did not, however, consider that there had been ""nastiness"". Paul Kron also spoke of tenseness between the parties, and acknowledged having said, in his statement, that the deceased had expressed hatred for Messrs Murrant and King.143 Mr Murrant, who was spoken to by police in July 2000, gave evidence of having first met the deceased in 1998, at a time when they were both police prosecutors, and of having invited him to join Blue Falcon. He acknowledged that Mr King and the deceased had not got along together, and that there had been issues as to the deceased’s management of the business, and cash flow problems. He had apparently resigned from the Police Service in September 1998, following the issue of a Loss of Confidence letter from the Police Commissioner, in relation to his secondary employment in the business.  
     
      
    144 Mr Murrant said that he had been called to give evidence at the Police Integrity Commission inquiry in 1999, and arising out of that exercise was later convicted of giving false evidence, and sentenced to periodic detention. He said that he had not blamed the deceased for what had occurred to him, in this regard, and denied having been involved in his murder. He had no recollection of being told by Mr King that the deceased had been an informer, and had no knowledge of whether or not that had been the case.145 It was his evidence that, consistently with his normal practice, he had been having dinner at the local restaurant with one or more of the members of his family and a close friend, whom he named, on the evening of 6 June preparatory to reporting for periodic detention at Parramatta on the following day. He was unable to provide details of the restaurant which they had attended this night, although he named those in the Bondi area that they had used for such dinners.146 His various accounts to police concerning the dinner were somewhat vague, and not entirely consistent, but there was evidence from the close friend, Anthony Raiche, that tended to corroborate their practice of dining together on the nights before Mr Murrant went into periodic detention, although he too could not be specific as to where they had dinner on the night of 6 June 2000, or as to who had been present.147 This witness confirmed that the Police Integrity Commission experience had been hard on Mr Murrant and that the latter had made both favourable and unfavourable references to the deceased. Detective Sergeant Morgan said that his inquiries showed that while the deceased had not been an informant, Mr Murrant had indicated to him a belief to the contrary, and said that he appeared to have held some animosity and resentment towards him.148 Mr King gave evidence to the effect that he had joined Blue Falcon in 1984, as the security manager, that he had left the company in 1991, and had then rejoined it in 1996 upon the deceased’s invitation, in a managerial role. He was a shareholder and director, but had no direct financial interest in it. He said that he became aware of problems with the payment of superannuation to the Australian Tax Office, which led to the disagreement with the deceased. This he described as ""a bit of a push and shove which was over before it started, and we then sat down and discussed it”. On his account there was no anger, just frustration in relation to the deceased’s apparent lack of understanding of the problem.149 The investigation into Mr Murrant, he acknowledged, had placed a strain on the relationship. In May 1999 he said the deceased offered to resign upon conditions that he, Mr King, would take over Blue Falcon, that the company would take responsibility for its debts, and that the company would return his phone and pay him some money. He declined the offer, and resigned himself. At the time, he agreed the company had many debts, including moneys owed to staff for superannuation and wages, and operational expenses, as well as a MasterCard debt.150 He said that when he spoke to the deceased in May 1999, the latter indicated that he had informed upon them to the Police Integrity Commission.  
     
      
    151 On the night of 6 June 2000, he said that he had been at the Swiss Grande Hotel at Bondi Beach drinking with the assistant coach of the Australian Socceroos, for whom he was providing security. It had initially been intended that he would accompany the team to a concert at the Hordern Pavilion, but that had been cancelled by reason of transport problems. He denied having anything to do with the killing, and also denied holding any resentment towards the deceased in relation to the Police Integrity Commission inquiry, at which he had been required to give evidence.152 There was no evidence to connect either of these men to the killing, and senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged, in the course of his submissions (TT 24/3/03 p 7) that he did not suggest that they had been responsible for it. 
     
      
    153 The appellant did not call any evidence, but did raise his good character so far as it was established, in the course of the Prosecution case, that he had no criminal history, and was not known by his work associates to have been prone to violence.  
     
      
    154 The Crown relied upon what were said to be 40 strands in a circumstantial case, to show that the appellant pre-planned the murder and was criminally responsible, either as having been the shooter, or as a party to the joint enterprise. In summary, and combining the strands which overlap, that case depended on the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
      (i) the appellant’s purchase of the chain and D-shackles on 30 May; 
       
       
      (ii) the appellants phone calls to Hornsby Marine on 29 and 30 May and on 7 June, and his hire of the aluminium boat; 
       
       
      (iii) the fact that the deceased was last seen alive in the company of the appellant and Mr Cowie at Excell’s office on the night of 6 June; 
       
       
      (iv) the fact that the clothing found on the deceased’s body matched the description of that which he had been last seen wearing while in their presence; 
       
       
      (v) the length of time his body had been in the water before discovery; 
       
       
      (vi) the fact that the body had been weighted in such a way that it would not have been expected to resurface; 
       
       
      (vii) the attitude of the deceased and the appellant towards each other at the time of the meeting, which had been fixed for 6 June, and the potential for confrontation that existed; 
       
       
      (viii) the untruths in the appellant’s statement to police, on 15 June, concerning, in particular, the visit to the Pizzeria which he said had been made, and the time at which they left those premises, and also concerning the deceased having consulted a watch, even though he did not have one; 
       
       
      (ix) the fact that no attempt was made by the deceased to phone Ms Johnson, after the meeting on 6 June, in circumstances where he would have been running late to meet her at about 9:30 PM if he were still alive; 
       
       
      (x) the fact that no food was found in the stomach of the deceased at post mortem; 
       
       
      (xi) the 9:45 PM phone call by the appellant to Excell, which could only have been intended for Mr Milner; 
       
       
      (xii) the appellant’s purchases at the Caltex service station at 9:25 PM and his activation of the security system at 9:58 PM.  
       
       
      (xiii) the phone calls that were made from the Brooklyn/Hawkesbury River area by the appellant at 10:51 PM on 6 June, and at 2:55 AM on 7 June, and at 3:47 AM by Mr Cowie on that day; 
       
       
      (xiv) the finding of the car of the deceased in Parkside Lane on 26 June, in circumstances suggesting that it had been wiped clean of fingerprints, but in which a fingerprint of Mr Cowie was found on one side of a Gregory’s road map for the relevant area; 
       
       
      (xv) the absence of the appellant at work until the late afternoon of 7 June;  
       
       
      (xvi) the lie told by the appellant to Ms Kristeller on 29 August 2000 to the effect that he had not purchased any chains in recent years, which was made at a time when he suspected that his phone and office were bugged.  
       
       
      (xvii) the nature of the execution of the deceased by a single shot fired to the back of his neck, from behind, while he was wearing a beanie, without any signs of a struggle, and the steps that were taken to contain any potential evidence of the place of its occurrence; 
       
       
      (xviii) the fact that the appellant and Cowie had access to .22 ammunition and were familiar with the use of firearms; 
       
       
      (xix) the fact that the appellant had been present at a training session where the effectiveness of a shot to the back of the lower head had been discussed.  
       
       
      (xx) the conversations which the appellant had with Mr Thompson after the deceased’s disappearance concerning the steps that could possibly be taken in relation to firearms, either to alter them or to cover up their presence.  
       
       
      (xxi) the close relationship between the appellant and Mr Cowie, and the need for two people to have been involved in moving and dumping a body wrapped in plastic and tied up with chains;  
       
      
    155 In my view, this combination of circumstances was compelling, and supported no reasonable inference other than that the appellant planned and organised the killing of the deceased on the night of 6 June.  
     
      
    156 He had a motive and he had the means to commit the crime, including the disposal of the body, and there was evidence which was consistent with him having been in the area of the Hawkesbury River, where the body was dumped.  
     
      
    157 Further, there was evidence of him having lied in relation to material matters, and to have acquired chains and a boat shortly prior to the disappearance. 
     
      
    158 It may be accepted that the request for a provision of .22 subsonic ammunition had initially been made at a time that was sufficiently remote from 6 June, as to be, at best, equivocal, in relation to the existence of any long term planning. However, the same cannot be said of the purchase of the chains and D-shackles or the hire of the aluminium boat.  
     
      
    159 A question admittedly arises as to the length of chain wrapped around the body, which was in excess of the 15 metres, which the appellant had ordered. That was a matter for the jury, which, upon the evidence, was well entitled to conclude that the measuring system used by Mr Weinecke was somewhat generous, and that his recollection was imprecise.  
     
      
    160 There was evidence that the meeting had been organised several days, at least, before 6 June, and that it was not something that had been arranged at the last moment, that is, in circumstances where there would have been no occasion for the pre-planning of a murder.  
     
      
    161 Counsel for the appellant, who addressed each of the forty strands in the Crown case, in his address to the jury, focussed before us on four particular areas of the evidence that, in his submission, mitigated against the appellant’s involvement in the killing, or in its pre-planning.  
     
      
    162 The first was the request of Mr Cowie to be taken to the railway station, which it was contended would not have occurred had the killing been planned, since Mr Cowie’s assistance was needed to remove the body. The second was the placing of the call to the deceased’s mobile service at 10:51 PM which, it was contended, suggested that he was unaware of his death. The third related to the attendance at the Lane Cove service station, and the purchases that were made, it being contended that had the killing been pre-planned, then those items would have been procured in advance. The fourth related to the fact that the evidence, concerning the Olympic contract and motive, did not always go in the same way in support of the Crown case theory that details of the contract and of Excell’s business were being withheld, or that relations between the appellant and the deceased were seriously strained.  
     
      
    163 These were properly matters for the jury to weigh, but none of them was, in my view, such as to require this Court, or the jury, to have entertained a reasonable doubt. The first two matters and particularly the second, were entirely consistent with having been ruses to deflect suspicion, or in the case of the 10:51 PM call, to check whether the deceased’s mobile to which the appellant had made earlier calls that day, was still on his body. No other reason for such a late call was apparent, particularly if the meeting had ended amicably, as the appellant said to police and to others. 
     
      
    164 The third pre-supposes that criminal activity will be meticulously planned in every aspect. Trial experience shows that such an assumption is dubious, otherwise conviction rates would undoubtedly be much lower. In any event, there was no particular necessity for the body to have been moved immediately, particularly as there was a more urgent need to move the deceased’s motor vehicle from the area outside the Excell office. It had to be moved quickly since there was a risk of the deceased’s girlfriend, or other persons, coming to the office looking for him. 
     
      
    165 It is the case that the appellant also challenged the Crown case theory concerning the steps that were taken after the killing, upon the basis that to have left the body at the premises unattended, even for a short time, risked its discovery, in view of Mr Milner’s likely presence. That is a fair comment, but it was a matter for the jury to consider in the light of the possibility that the body may well have already been placed in the boat which was on a trailer and concealed from vision.  
     
      
    166 The most positive evidence to suggest that the appellant had indicated an intention to reserve the Olympic contract for himself, and to keep the deceased in the dark both about it, and about the business, came from Mr Thompson. So far as there was evidence to the contrary, in particular from Mr Douglas and Ms Kristeller, that was an issue which the jury were in a better position to judge, since it involved an assessment of the credibility, and apparent certainty of recollection, of those witnesses.  
     
      
    167 In any event the Olympic contract was not the only matter in issue, or likely to be the subject of the potential confrontation, of which the deceased had said that he expected would occur at the meeting.  
     
      
    168 Similarly, Counsel pointed to what he asserted was the prepondence of the evidence that the relationship between the appellant and the deceased was cordial. That depended largely upon the observations of other employees of Excell or associates of the appellant, who also acknowledged that the deceased was rarely seen at the office. In those circumstances the evidence of the witnesses who were close to the deceased and privy to the concerns, which he had expressed to them, had greater weight. Again, however, this was a factual question in respect of which the jury were in a better position to judge. 
     
      
    169 While disavowing any submission that the deceased's former partners in Blue Falcon, or the former partner of Ms Johnson had been involved in the killing, Counsel did submit that the evidence concerning the sighting of a tall blond man at the Shell service station on Willoughby Road, on the night of 6 June, who used the public phone at that location, left open a reasonable possibility that this person was the deceased, giving rise to the further possibility that he was killed after leaving the appellant and dumped by someone else in the Hawkesbury River. 
     
      
    170 The evidence concerning this sighting was vague in the extreme, and an examination of the call charge records for the phone did not turn up any call to a person known to the deceased. No other person came forward to report having received a call from the deceased and the one person who might have expected a call, Ms Johnson, said that she had not heard from him. 
     
      
    171 The jury were properly entitled to consider this aspect of the case to have been a false trail of the kind that commonly emerges in a murder investigation, particularly in the light of the evidence pointing to the presence of the appellant and of Mr Cowie, later that night, in the area where the body was later recovered.  
     
      
    172 Another matter put by counsel for the appellant at trial, and on the appeal, was that had the killing been pre-planned, or had the appellant been responsible, then the forensic trails concerning the chains, the boat hire the purchases at the Lane Cove service station, and so on, would not have been left behind. The Crown response, which similarly was a matter for the jury to assess, was that there never was any expectation that the body would be found, and hence no concern in relation to those forensic trails.  
     
      
    173 Finally it was submitted by the appellant that the reasonable possibility of Mr Cowie spontaneously, without any warning or preconcert, shooting the deceased, could not be excluded. There was no evidence, in my view, that would have left this open as a reasonable possibility. In particular there was no motive for him to have committed such an act, the prior argument having, on the evidence, been a passing incident followed by an amicable meeting at a hotel some weeks later.  
     
      
    174 The matters which counsel identified were all before the jury and they are properly to be taken into account by us in determining whether a reasonable doubt should be entertained of the kind referred to in M v The Queen. I am not persuaded that this case is one where that test has been established. On the contrary, it appears to me that the combination of circumstances relied upon by the Crown, taking into account all of the criticisms identified by counsel for the appellant, remains compelling.  
     
      
    175 The acquittal of the co-accused, Cowie, does not, of itself, involve an inconsistent verdict, or give rise to a reasonable doubt in relation to the appellant. The jury may have had a reasonable doubt, in the context of the Crown case, which depended upon the appellant having been the shooter, or the person who had pre-planned the killing, as to whether Cowie’s involvement had been other than that of an accessory after the fact.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury that they could not convict the appellant unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had planned the murder of the deceased 
       
      
    176 Senior Counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial, and on the appeal, did not seek the direction, which, it is now contended, should have been given. In fact, in the course of the discussion which was held prior to the addresses, a positive indication was given (T 1390/1) by Counsel that it was not required, it being accepted that the Crown circumstantial case fell into the strands in a cable category, rather than the links in a chain category. 
     
      
    177 The circumstances where a direction should be given, as to the proof of an essential intermediate fact beyond reasonable doubt, were identified in Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 and R v Zaiter [2004] NSWCCA 35 at paras 10 to 13.  
     
      
    178 The Crown here pursued its case, throughout, upon the basis that it was the appellant who had been the instigator of the killing, who had planned it, and who had been party to a joint criminal enterprise. It was accepted, and the jury were directed, that unless he was found guilty, Cowie must be acquitted. 
     
      
    179 In these circumstances, it was obvious to the jury that they had to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, before convicting him, that he had either personally shot the deceased, or that he had organised and planned the killing.  
     
      
    180 The proof of that degree of participation depended upon the strands in the circumstantial case, previously identified, which were in my view overwhelming. The fact that he planned and organised the killing arose by inference from those circumstances.  
     
      
    181 The jury were appropriately instructed that the Crown case had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Having regard to the way that the case was conducted, and to the acceptance by experienced Senior Counsel, at trial, that a Shepherd direction was not required, leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, to raise this ground, should be refused.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - The trial miscarried by reason of the publication on the Internet, both before and during the trial, of two interlocutory judgments 
       
      
    182 This ground related to the publication, on the Court’s website (www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/sc) during the trial, of two interlocutory judgments delivered by Hidden J on 17 December 2002, and 13 February 2003 respectively.  
     
      
    183 The first of these (R v Crowther-Wilkinson and Cowie [2002] NSWSC 1207) concerned the application of Cowie for a separate trial. In the course of the reasons that were given for refusing the application, his Honour set out the outline of the Crown case as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Wilkinson and Cowie were close associates and, as I have said, Cowie was employed in the business at the relevant time. 
         
        (b) The two accused had been in regular telephone contact up to and just after the disappearance of the deceased. 
         
        (c) The deceased was last seen alive a little after 7 pm on 6 June, 2000, when he attended a meeting with Wilkinson and Cowie at the business premises at Chatswood. 
         
        (d) On 12 July, 2000 the deceased was found floating in the Hawkesbury River near Brooklyn. He was dressed in the same clothes he had been wearing at the Chatswood meeting. The cause of death was a single gunshot wound, believed to be of low velocity, to the back of the head. 
         
        (e) Wilkinson had attended a course in terminal ballistics, where he was instructed about the effectiveness of shooting a person in the lower brain stem. 
         
        (f) As I have said, the body was weighed down with chains. Equipment of that kind had been purchased by Wilkinson about nine days prior to the deceased’s disappearance. 
         
        (g) The deceased was a tall man, who weighed 135 kilograms with the chains around him. It would need two people to dispose of his body. 
         
        (h) The deceased’s motor vehicle was found abandoned at Chatswood, but at a location different from that of the business premises. 
         
        (i) Cowie’s fingerprint was found on the Chatswood page of a street directory in the car.  
         
        (j) In a statement, Wilkinson said that after the meeting at Chatswood he joined the deceased for dinner at a pizzeria in Willoughby and they parted at 10 pm. The owner and an employee of the pizzeria did not recognise either the deceased or the accused being present that night. 
         
        (k) Wilkinson also stated that, after the meal with the deceased, he returned to work and checked his emails. A forensic examination shows that his emails were not checked on that occasion. 
         
        (l) Wilkinson purchased a tank of petrol at a service station at Lane Cove at 9.25 pm on 6 June, 2000. Confectionary and cigarettes, including the brand smoked by Cowie, were also purchased. 
         
        (m) Telephone records and other evidence, the detail of which I need not recite, suggest that Cowie’s mobile phone was in the Brooklyn area in the early hours of 7 June, 2000 and that Wilkinson used it to make a call. 
         
        (n) When interviewed, Wilkinson denied having been in the Brooklyn area. 
         
        (o) Wilkinson denied owning or having access to a boat. An Excell employee had observed a twelve foot aluminium boat at the business premises. Wilkinson said that he had borrowed it.  
         
        (p) According to the same employee, Wilkinson asked him after 6 June, 2000 if he knew of a dealer who could alter firearms, so that it could not be ascertained if they had been fired. 
         
        (q) The deceased had expressed concern at not receiving accurate information about the business profits. He had told a friend that he intended to confront Wilkinson on 6 June, 2000. 
         
        (r) Wilkinson was in the process of obtaining a contract to supply security staff for the Olympics. He had said that he did not intend to share this venture with the deceased. 
         
        (s) There is evidence from a witness that, after the disappearance of the deceased, Cowie said that Wilkinson owed him ""big time."" 
         
        (t) Cowie’s statement to the police was exculpatory. He said that after the meeting at Chatswood he went home and surfed the internet. Police evidence would show that he did not do so. 
         
        (u) There is evidence from another witness of a physical confrontation between Cowie and the deceased in 1999, creating ill-will between them.” 
         
        
       
      
    184 An observation was made to the effect that: “It may well be that the case against Mr Cowie is not as strong as that against Mr Wilkinson”; however that was tempered by a later observation that “this is not a case in which the evidence against one accused is significantly stronger than, and different from that against the other.” 
     
      
    185 There was evidence to show that this judgment had been available on the Court’s website from 5 February 2003.  
     
      
    186 The second judgment (R v Crowther-Wilkinson and Cowie [2003] NSWSC 44) concerned the admissibility of an exculpatory statement that was made by Mr Cowie to the police on 4 August 2000 but which the Crown wished to tender, upon the basis that it contained a lie as to a material circumstance. It was held to be inadmissible by reason of non-compliance with s 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act, since it had not been the subject of a tape recording. Relevantly the reasons for judgment noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “6 Much of the statement deals with background which, the Crown prosecutor told me, is uncontroversial and able to be proved by other evidence. However, the later part of the statement deals with the events of 6 June 2000 and contains material which is, of course, important. It was that night that the deceased disappeared and it was then, on the Crown case, that he was killed. Mr Cowie was an employee of a security company, of which Mr Wilkinson and the deceased were the proprietors. Mr Cowie’s statement records his activities that afternoon and the arrival of the deceased at the business premises in the early evening for a meeting with Mr Wilkinson. He goes on to say that Mr Wilkinson and the deceased decided to go out and have a meal, that all three left the premises, that he was driven by Mr Wilkinson to a suburban railway station and dropped off, and that the deceased followed them in his own car. When he alighted from Mr Wilkinson’s car, the deceased blew his horn or flashed his lights and he waved back. The effect of his statement is that that is the last he saw of the deceased and that he had nothing to do with his death.” 
        
       
      
    187 After noting that, to this point, Mr Cowie had not said anything about the evening which could amount to an admission, his Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “8 It is what follows that the Crown relies upon as an admission. The statement goes on to recount that Mr Cowie then proceeded to his home where, as he put it, “I surfed the Internet and caught up on my emails.” The Crown can produce expert evidence that his computer was not used for that purpose that night, and it was to be the Crown case that that part of his statement is a lie designed to mislead the police about his whereabouts at a crucial time.” 
        
       
      
    188 His Honour then went on to note that the police officers concerned had said that it was not until they had compared this statement with the statement that had earlier been taken from the appellant, and had noticed an inconsistency in their accounts as to the events following the meeting, that Mr Cowie had come under suspicion. 
     
      
    189 There was evidence that this judgment was available on the Court’s website from 7 March 2003. 
     
      
    190 An additional judgment (R v Crowther-Wilkinson and Cowie [2003] NSWSC 226 dated 28 March 2003) was also published on the Court’s website, granting the Crown leave to cross-examine Mr Weinecke. No point was taken in relation to this judgment, no doubt upon the basis that the witness was later cross-examined in the presence of the jury.  
     
      
    191 Evidence was placed before us to show that the Supreme Court site is easily accessed, either directly, if the address is known, or via common search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Alta Vista, Ninemsn and so on, without charge. No barriers exist to access, passwords are not required and there is no need to register access to the site. Inquiry using the case name is sufficient.  
     
      
    192 There was also evidence to show that internet access via a recognized search engine, under the name of an accused, will return articles posted on the websites of the newspapers circulating in the Sydney region. By way of example, a current inquiry using the name of the present appellant threw up an article posted on the Sydney Morning Herald website of 9 May 2002 reporting on the first trial.  
     
      
    193 As at April 2003 other articles on the websites of the Daily Telegraph and regional and interstate newspapers, referring to the earlier trial of the appellant in the Supreme Court, were available, although they have since been deleted. 
     
      
    194 The evidence additionally showed that at the relevant time the judgments in question were freely available without the need to subscribe, or to enter via a password, on the Lexis and AustLII sites. Additionally it showed that an inquiry using the appellant’s name, via a search engine, would have located the Daily Court List of 6 June 2002, showing his first trial to have been part heard before Bell J, and that one click on the Lawlink tab, on that page, would have facilitated a search for any judgments that had been delivered. 
     
      
    195 No additional complaint is made in relation to any material that may have been available on the internet beyond the two specific judgments which I have mentioned. 
     
      
    196 In order to deal with this ground, it is necessary to recall that a jury was empanelled on Monday 10 February 2003. However, that jury was discharged on Wednesday 12 February 2003 due to the illness of a juror.  
     
      
    197 A further jury was empanelled on Thursday 13 February 2003. Although the transcript did not record his Honour’s opening remarks to the jury that day in full, a summary was noted in, inter alia, the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(His Honour informed the jury of the following: The legal representatives and their function; normal sitting hours; function of his Honour; invariably argument discussed in the absence of the jury and the reason why; function of the jury, being judges of the facts; separate verdicts in respect of each accused; Crown had the burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt;  
        to consider the evidence impartially and rationally with a decision based only on the evidence 
        ; to keep their own counsel in and about the course (sic) precincts, avoiding contact; not to discuss the case which (sic) any person except fellow jurors when all together in the jury room:…” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    198 A direction to the jury to similar effect, namely that “you must decide the case only on the evidence you have heard and seen in this courtroom, and you must have regard to nothing else” was given by his Honour during the summing up (SU T p 4). 
     
      
    199 After the short adjournment, and before any evidence was led, it became necessary for his Honour to discharge a juror, and the trial thereafter proceeded with the remaining 11 jurors. Following the opening addresses, and at the end of the first day of the resumed trial, his Honour made some further observations to the jury, including a warning to keep their own counsel during the trial.  
     
      
    200 Before adjourning for the day, the transcript records the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: we might talk over – remind me, it is probably a good idea these days to caution the jury about surfing the net about cases generally or in particular. I think that ought to be done, and I will do it first thing tomorrow, unless you want me to do it this afternoon.  
        
       
       
        
        (All counsel – no your Honour)” 
        
       
      
    201 Whether or not the negative response of counsel was in fact an indication that they did not want the warning to be given at all, or whether it was an indication that they did not want it done that afternoon, is not entirely clear. Whatever be the case in that regard, the transcript for Friday 14 February, summarises the observations which his Honour made to the jury at the commencement of that day’s hearing: 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of the general directions given yesterday his Honour stated he had emphasized the need to discuss the case and now added to that the following:  
        Not to go surfing the net for information about cases or criminal trials, which may not be accurate. 
         Especially to bear in mind they would hear the evidence first hand and in respect of the necessary legal matters these would be given by counsel and his Honour.)” (Emphasis added).  
        
       
       
      Counsel were apparently content with the terms of this direction, and did not request any greater specificity.  
       
      
    202 The concerns, which have arisen from time to time, in relation to the effects on jurors of adverse publicity, occurring either pre-trial or during the trial, do raise somewhat similar considerations.  
     
      
    203 There have obviously been cases where it has been considered necessary to halt a trial mid stream, where that kind of publicity has been particularly prejudicial. The principle which has been established in relation to this kind of event and other prejudicial happenings, is one of necessity; that is, there has to be a “high degree of need”, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice, before a discharge will be ordered: Crofts v The Queen (1986) 186 CLR 427 at 432.  
     
      
    204 In most instances, it has been accepted that sufficient directions can be given to overcome the problem, since it has been recognized that jurors can be trusted to obey the directions that they are given: R v Bell NSWCCA 8 October 1998, Glennon v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603, Hinch v Attorney General (Vic) (No. 2) (1998) 164 CLR 15 at 74, Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 99, R v Yuill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450 at 453/4, and R v Loguancio (2000) 1 VR 235 at para 24.  
     
      
    205 This is an important assumption, which underpins the retention of jury trials (see R v Gilbert (2000) 201 CLR 414 per McHugh J at para 31). I do not believe that it has been fatally flawed by the experience in the two recent cases decided in this State to which I will later refer (R v K [2003] NSWCCA 401 and R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37).  
     
      
    206 The authorities concerning prejudicial publicity tend to suggest moreover that the mere possibility of a juror having acquired prejudicial or extraneous knowledge, during a trial, is not normally a sufficient basis for concluding that the accused did not have a fair trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    207 For example, in Glennon, Mason CJ and Toohey J said at 603: 
     
      
       
        
        “Likewise, the suggestion that there was a substantial risk that at least one juror would have acquired knowledge, before the verdict was given, of the respondent’s prior conviction was again a matter of mere conjecture or speculation. The mere possibility that such knowledge may have been acquired by a juror during the trial is not a sufficient basis for concluding that the accused did not have a fair trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice. Something more must be shown. The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial.” 
        
       
      
    208 In Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 94, Mason CJ and Toohey J said at 99: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it is misleading to think that, because a juror has heard something of the circumstances giving rise to the trial, the accused has lost the opportunity of an indifferent jury. The matter was put this way by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R v Hubbert (1975) 29 CCC (2d) 279 at 291:  
         
          
         
          
          ‘In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naive to think that in the case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence.’” 
          
         
         
         
          
        
       
      
    209 Counsel for the appellant drew attention, however, to the decision of Hampel J in R v McLachlan [2000] VSC 215, in support of the proposition that the availability on an internet site, accessible to the public, of information concerning an accused that was not before the jury, did present an unacceptable risk of injustice. In that case there was material available on the Crime Net site which provided information in relation to the accused who was facing a retrial. The trial was a short one and the problem was compounded by a Radio National segment in relation to the Crime Net site that had been put to air during the trial. 
     
      
    210 A different result occurred in R v Cogley [2000] VSCA 231 where the Supreme Court of Victoria, Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the trial judge not to discharge the jury when it was discovered, during the jury deliberations, that similar information relating to an accused, who was being retried, was available on the Crime Net site.  
     
      
    211 In Cogley the appeal was dismissed upon the basis that the trial judge had properly taken into account the relevant circumstances, and that he had been best placed to determine whether a miscarriage might have occurred if the jury were not discharged. The relevant circumstances noted were three in number: first, that nearly all of the relevant information on the Crime Net was known to the jury from material led in the trial; secondly, that his Honour had assessed the jury to have been conscientious and attentive in the performance of their functions; and thirdly, they had been told by his Honour to disregard the fact of the first trial, and to decide the case on the evidence before them.  
     
      
    212 These decisions do point to the need to decide each case upon its own facts. They do not provide authority for any general proposition that the possibility of juror access to material concerning an accused, that is not before the jury, will lead to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    213 The problem of internet access raised its head in the this state In R v K [2003] NSWCCA 406. In that case evidence emerged, after the trial had concluded, to show that there had been juror access to information that was available on the internet, which revealed that the accused had previously stood trial for the murder of his second wife. That disclosure was held, in the particular circumstances of a case, where the accused was on trial for the murder of his first wife, to have involved a sufficient risk of prejudice, amounting to a miscarriage of justice, such as to require the Court to set aside the conviction, and to order a new trial. The potential prejudice related to the risk of the jury applying tendency/coincidence reasoning, or of it regarding the material as having raised bad character, even though neither of those aspects had been relied upon by the Crown.  
     
      
    214 The relevant test was accepted to be that which had been stated in R v Marsland NSWCCA 17 July 1991, and applied in R v Rudkowsky NSWCCA 15 December 1992, where Gleeson CJ (with whom Cripps JA and McInerney J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant was entitled to be tried and to have his guilt determined according to law. In determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice in a case such as the present it is important to bear in mind that in this context the word  
        ""justice"" 
         means justice according to the law. It is not for this Court to decide for itself after perusing the evidence whether we agree with the jury's verdict. Nor is it for this Court to decide whether, even if the irregularity had not occurred, it is likely or even probable that the jury would have reached the same conclusion. We are not (sic) here to decide whether or not the appellant received a fair trial and whether or not his conviction was one entered in accordance with the legal rules that govern the trial of a person in a case such as the present.  
        
       
       
        
        However, as has been pointed out by counsel for the Crown, the circumstances that there has been shown to have been an irregularity in the trial does not necessarily mean that the conviction must be quashed and there must be a new trial. It is common ground in this appeal that the test to be applied is that which was stated in the case of  
        R v Marsland,  
        that is to say, whether we can be satisfied that the irregularity has not affected the verdict and that the jury would have returned the same verdict if the irregularity had not occurred. That, it is accepted on both sides, is the test to determine whether in the events that have happened in a case like the present, there has been a miscarriage of justice” 
         
         
        
       
      
    215 In my decision, with which Grove and Dunford JJ agreed, I identified the desirability, for the future, of judges directing juries, inter alia, to refrain from undertaking any independent research or inquiries, whether via the internet or otherwise, concerning the accused or the case before them.  
     
      
    216 I also made the following observations: 
     
      
       
        
        “80 The case is one of potential ongoing importance, having regard to the extent of the information which is now available on the internet, concerning criminal investigations and trials, not only via online media reports and services, but also via legal databases and the judgment systems of the Courts. The problem is compounded by the greater familiarity which the current generation has with the use of information technology, and the ever reducing cost of acquiring and using that technology.  
        
       
       
        
        81 It may well become the case, as a matter of habit arising out of the way that ordinary affairs are conducted, that the inevitable reaction of any person who is summonsed as a juror, will be to undertake an online search in relation to the case, to ascertain what it may involve.” 
        
       
      
    217 It was not my intention, in these passages, to suggest that the mere possibility of some independent research or inquiry being undertaken by a juror, or the absence of a direction of the kind suggested, should inevitably result in a retrial. Rather, I had in mind the pragmatic desirability of judges taking steps that might limit the possibility of extraneous and potentially prejudicial research being undertaken.  
     
      
    218 Similar problems have arisen in other cases, which were conveniently noted by this Court (Mason P, Wood CJ at CL, Sully J) in R v Skaf  [2004] NSWCCA 37. That was a case where, despite a general warning by the trial judge, two jurors decided to undertake a private view at night, and to conduct an experiment, at the scene of an alleged sexual assault. Identification of the attacker in that case was very much in issue, and there could have been no certainty as to whether or not the view, and the experiment which the two jurors had undertaken, replicated the lighting and other conditions of the night of the attack, or were even undertaken, in the same location. Again, it was considered necessary, applying the same test as that applied in Marsland, Rudkowsky and K (at para 242), to order a new trial.  
     
      
    219 On this occasion, recommendations were made (at paras 278 to 286) to reinforce those which were made in R v K, not in terms leading to an automatic retrial if they were given, but for similar pragmatic considerations to those mentioned above.  
     
      
    220 It was submitted that the irregularity in Rudkowsky had been “potential” rather than “actual”, since there was no direct evidence as to whether any of the jurors had in fact read the prejudicial document which, by mistake, had been included in the material placed before them.  
     
      
    221 Consistently with the line of authority examined in R v Skaf, the exclusionary rule in relation to jury deliberations must be preserved, such that evidence cannot be received as to what jurors did in the course of their deliberations, or as to what bearing some irregular event or piece of information had for their verdict.  
     
      
    222 The risk of prejudice must be weighed independently of those considerations. Rudkowsky is clearly distinguishable in that it was there known that the offending material had been in the jury room, having been included with the exhibits which it was their task to examine. Rudowsky was argued, and decided, upon the assumption that the jurors had accessed the material. The present case is far removed from it.  
     
      
    223 As I have observed, there is no evidence in this case to show that any juror accessed the judgments, or either of them, so that the case is not on all fours with Marsland, Rudkowski, K, or Skaf where there was a proven irregularity. Rather, it is concerned with the existence of a source of information concerning the case, which a juror might possibly have accessed. Whether that occurred or not is a matter for speculation.  
     
      
    224 It follows that the Marsland/Rudkowsky test is not directly applicable, although I consider that some guidance can be gained from it and from the decisions concerning the existence of adverse publicity. So viewed, the question becomes one as to whether the presence of the material on the internet posed an unacceptably high risk of prejudice to the appellant, thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    225 In my view, that question should be answered in the negative, for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
      (a) There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that any member of the jury accessed the internet; 
       
       
      (b) On the first day of the trial the jury was given an instruction to consider the evidence impartially and rationally with a decision based only on the evidence; 
       
       
      (c) On the morning of the second day of the trial his Honour gave the jury a direction not to surf the internet, which was cast in general terms, no doubt in order to avoid any hint that a search against the name of the accused might produce a positive result; 
       
       
      (d) The jury were directed again, during the summing up, to decide the case solely on the evidence before them; 
       
       
      (e) The information contained in the two judgments was for the most part placed before the jury although it would seem that, as a result of his Honour’s ruling, item (t) identified in the outline of the Crown case in the first judgment of Hidden J was not before the jury; and that, as a result of a ruling of Bell J at the earlier trial, items (k), (n), and (o) were also not placed before the jury.  
       
       
      (f) The observation in the separate trial judgment to the effect that the Crown case against the appellant was stronger than that against Mr Cowie, was entirely innocuous, being nothing more than a comparative evaluation, and in any event, that was a circumstance which must have been abundantly clear to the jury; 
       
       
      (g) The case against the appellant was absolutely compelling, such that his conviction would have been inevitable, whether or not the judgments were accessed by one or more members of the jury.  
       
      
    226 It may be observed that a similar view was taken by the Supreme Court of Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Long (2003) 138 A Crim R 103, where the availability of pre trial and internet publicity concerning the appellant, who had been charged with murder arising out of the notorious Childers Backpackers fire, was held not to give rise to a sufficient risk of prejudice so as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    227 Before parting from this ground, I accept that there can be a significant difference between publication of material concerning an accused on populist sites or in those that are maintained by newspapers and media outlets, and those which are official sites maintained by courts or by recognised law publishers, in that greater weight and credence will attach to the latter. That may be an important, or even decisive, consideration in a case where actual access by a juror is shown.  
     
      
    228 However, the observations made in the decisions concerning prejudicial publicity remain very pertinent where it is not known whether there has been any access, and particularly where a direction has been given early in the trial to jurors to decide the case on the evidence and not to search the internet, as occurred here.  
     
      
    229 These observations should not be taken as undermining the importance of the appearance of justice being maintained. Rather they reflect the circumstance that not every event that may have conceivably affected a criminal trial will necessarily lead to a new trial. On the contrary, appellate review depends upon the precise circumstances of the case, and upon a realistic appraisal of whether, in the light of those circumstances, there was an unacceptably high risk of prejudice to the accused.  
     
      
    230 I would dismiss this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    231 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal dismissed; 
       
       
      2. Conviction and sentence below confirmed. 
       
      
    232 DOWD J: I agree with the proposed orders and reasons of Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    233 KIRBY J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BRYSON JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon her by her Honour Judge English in the District Court at Taree on Friday 29 August 2003. The offence charged was conspiracy under the Common Law: conspiring with Brendan William Fensom and Bradley Scott Lewis on 20 November 2002 to dishonestly obtain the benefit of $20,800 for Bradley Scott Lewis by deception, by falsely reporting to the police that a motor vehicle owned by Lewis was stolen, with the intention of destroying the motor vehicle and dishonestly making a claim for compensation on the insurer. Conspiracy is an offence for which no maximum term of imprisonment is prescribed by law. The substantive offence to which the conspiracy related is the offence of “obtaining money etc by deception” under s.178BA of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is five years’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 Pursuant to the conspiracy the applicant and Fensom removed the vehicle from a car park and Lewis falsely reported that it had been stolen. The offence was discovered by chance less than an hour later when police stopped the vehicle for a random breath test. The applicant made substantial admissions in an electronically recorded interview within the next few hours. An Information was laid on 1 April 2003, the applicant was arrested on 1 May 2003 on warrant and she then obtained bail. She indicated that she would plead guilty on the first occasion she was brought before Taree Local Court. Later she was committed for sentence to Taree District Court under s.51A of the Justices Act 1900.  
     
      
    3 Her Honour Judge English heard evidence and submissions on sentence on 25 August 2003 relating to all three parties to the conspiracy, who all pleaded guilty. On 29 August 2003 her Honour made remarks on sentence and sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for two years to commence on 29 July 2003 and to expire on 28 July 2005. Her Honour set a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 29 July 2003 and to expire on 28 January 2005. Her Honour imposed the same sentence on Lewis; with the minor variation that the term of two years commenced on 29 August 2003, as did the non-parole period, which was to expire on 28 February 2005. Her Honour sentenced Fensom to a term of imprisonment of 18 months and imposed a non-parole period of 13½ months. 
     
      
    4 Her Honour acted on the view that the applicant had earlier spent one month in custody for this offence; this was based on misinformation to the effect that the appellant was arrested on 1 April 2003 and bailed on 1 May 2003, whereas in fact she was arrested and bailed on 1 May 2003. Except in this respect the sentences imposed on the applicant and Lewis were the same. While passing sentence her Honour observed of the applicant:  
     
      
       
        
        Whilst I find you are the mastermind behind the scheme it would not have been carried out had Mr Lewis not actively participated to the extent that he did and for that reason I have had regard to the issue of parity. 
        
       
      
    5 The parity thus apparently achieved was later disturbed when on 5 December 2003 the Court of Criminal Appeal (Hidden J, Smart AJ) allowed an appeal by Lewis and in lieu sentenced him to imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 29 August 2003 with a non-parole period of 16 weeks expiring on 18 December 2003 on which date he was to be released on parole: R. v. Lewis [2003] NSWCCA 375. Their Honours made observations on the relative degree of criminality between Lewis and the applicant which should not influence the view we now take. Their Honours acted on the view that there was a big difference in subjective features of Lewis and the applicant’s situations and said at [12]: 
     
      
       
        
        On the issue of due proportion [Lewis] has a justifiable sense of grievance. The sentence imposed does not reflect his strong subjective features. 
        
       
      
    6 The first ground of appeal contended for was that her Honour erred in law in that her Honour failed to give an appropriate allowance for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    7 There is little reference to the pleas of guilty of the applicant and of the co-offenders in her Honour’s remarks on sentence. In relation to the applicant her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        I am unable to find that she is either remorseful or contrite, other than to the extent that her plea of guilty shows some contrition and has public utility. 
        
       
       
      Otherwise there is no exposition of the impact which the plea of guilty, the time at which it was made and its utilitarian value had on the process of reasoning. It could be said that the contrition displayed by the plea was qualified by the fortuitous early discovery by police of the offence. Nevertheless the plea in fact had utilitarian value as it was made at the first opportunity which arose.  
       
      
    8 The passage which I have set out shows that the learned Judge did take the plea into account as relevant to contrition; and it should not be concluded that the plea was not given weight. Overall considerations related to the length of the sentence actually imposed, with which I deal later, taken with the explicit reference to the public utility of the plea, seem to me to show that some discount for the plea of guilty probably entered into her Honour’s considerations. However it is unfortunate that her Honour did not respond to the encouragement offered by the observations of Spigelman CJ in R. v. Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at page 419 para [160] to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence or in some other way to give an indication of the part taken by the plea in the Judge’s reasoning process. There is no statement in her Honour’s reasons showing whether some discount, expressed in percentage terms or otherwise, was taken into consideration, or whether there were in her Honour’s view reasons why no such discount should be applied.  
     
      
    9 As Spigelman CJ’s observations show, it is not an error to omit such a statement, and whether or not such a statement should be included in sentencing reasons is a matter for determination of the sentencing Judge. However overall the slight nature of the reference to the plea and its timing is unfortunate when an endeavour is made to review her Honour’s decision. It is reasonable to take the view that the weight accorded to the plea and its timing was not very great; but that is not the only view available and I do not know what view her Honour took. On a reasonable view the utilitarian advantages of the plea of guilty called for more consideration than a slight reference to it in the context of contrition, and I am at a disadvantage in not knowing what led to her Honour’s not making an explicit discount in the reasoning process underlying the sentence. There may have been some discount, and it is not an error not to articulate a discount in terms of a percentage; but I do not know what the reasoning process was, and I do not have the advantage of transparency of the process in this respect. I am left to address the contention that her Honour failed to give an appropriate allowance for the plea of guilty on very general considerations. 
     
      
    10 The second ground of appeal contended for was: 
     
      
       
        
        Her Honour failed to have proper regard to those matters relevant to special circumstances pursuant to s.44 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999 … 
        
       
      
    11 As the offence was committed before 1st February 2003, section 44 has effect in the form in which it was first enacted and not in the substituted form inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002, which commenced on 1st February 2003; see Sched.2 Pt.7 cl.45 inserted by that amendment. Subsection 44(2) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        (2) The non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision. 
        
       
       
      The sentence imposed on the applicant conforms with subs.44(2) as the non-parole period is three-quarters of the term of the sentence.  
       
      
    12 It is desirable that a sentencing Judge refer directly to consideration given to whether there are special circumstances; see R v Jenkins [1999] NSWCCA 110 and earlier cases referred to by Simpson J at [39]; it is not necessarily an error not to make such reference; R v. Mason [2000] NSWCCA 207 at [21] (Sully J). There is no reference to the question of special circumstances in relation to the applicant or as far as I can see in relation to any of the offenders in Judge English’s remarks on sentence. It was contended that given the combination of the applicant’s mature age and the probability that an extended period of supervision following release from custody would assist her rehabilitation, special circumstances ought to have been considered and a finding of special circumstances ought to have been made.  
     
      
    13 The applicant’s record of previous convictions includes a number of offences of various kinds, including one conviction for an offence which was frankly dishonest: stealing property in a dwelling house in 1999, for which a fine was imposed, and a number of convictions relating to driving offences, among them several for driving while her licence was cancelled or while she was a disqualified driver. In 2000 she was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for driving while disqualified; in 2001 she was convicted of several driving offences including driving while disqualified and required to perform 300 hours of community service. She was also convicted in 2003 of driving while disqualified and imprisoned for two months; this offence occurred later in time than the conspiracy charged.  
     
      
    14 Much of the material in the character references and testimonials had a claim to consideration as indications favourable to the applicant. Her criminal convictions came at unusual times in her life history, in that apart from one driving offence at the age of about 25, all of them occurred when she was 33 years of age or older, and this was explained, credibly, as related to life disturbance in a marriage breakdown. She was the primary carer of her 15-year-old son. Character evidence showed that she had performed very well under the community service order, making a positive contribution in the work of Port Macquarie Sea Rescue Group Inc, and continuing to do so after the obligation had ended. This shows that the applicant is capable of constructive action in a purposeful and structured activity managed by others. She continued to participate fully and enthusiastically in the Port Macquarie Sea Rescue Group Inc after completing community service there. She has worked and studied. These favourable indications, however, must be taken with the nature of her participation in the conspiracy, which over-shadows them and refutes the contention that the applicant has turned her life around. 
     
      
    15 Further attention to the applicant’s rehabilitation is quite appropriate, in view of past indications of good results from community service. In my opinion the circumstances referred to do not constitute special circumstances in the context of a decision under s.44 whether or not six months, or some longer period of her sentence should be available for supervision on parole. In the context set by s.44 the subject of special circumstances is not in my opinion opened up for consideration by any of the facts relating to the applicant which were put forward for consideration: I see no element in them which takes them out of the general provision to the effect that one quarter of the term of a sentence of imprisonment is to be available for parole. There is no reason to conclude that one quarter of the term of the sentence, the normal proportion contemplated by s.44, will not be adequate or should be varied. Although there would have been advantages in the learned Judge’s stating her Honour’s view on the question of special circumstances, there was, in my opinion, no error.  
     
      
    16 The third ground of appeal was: 
     
      
       
        
        Her Honour failed to observe procedural fairness in the manner in which she dealt with the applicant’s case specifically as to the treatment of character evidence and subjective matters generally. 
        
       
      
    17 Her Honour observed to the effect that two testimonials or character references which were tendered did not address the offence of conspiracy which was under consideration, and that they appeared to have been prepared for a less serious charge which had been dealt with in the Local Court not long before. Of Ms Hodgson, who gave oral character evidence, the learned Judge made observations which show that her Honour found the appraisal made by the witness unimpressive, in particular the witness’s evidence that since the applicant and her co-offender Fensom had become a couple their attitudes had changed dramatically and they had been a positive influence on each other. Her Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        I find that to be an extraordinary statement in view of the fact that Ms Wasson positively influenced Mr Fensom to commit this crime.  
        
       
       
      This was a relevant and strong reason for not accepting the witness’s evidence.  
       
      
    18 It was contended that as a matter of procedural fairness the learned Judge should have given an indication of an intention either to reject the references, including the evidence of Ms Hodgson, or not to place weight upon them; that such intention should have been communicated to the applicant’s representative so as to give an opportunity to address it. It was contended that if that opportunity had been given, a previously unsuccessful application for an adjournment to obtain a pre-sentence report might have been renewed. The applicant’s counsel referred to consideration given to questions of procedural fairness in relation to the views taken by Mason CJ and Brennan J on the question of law in Pantorno v. R (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 473, and also to Champion v. R (1992) 64 A Crim R 244 at 256-257 and to Parker v. DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 at 296. 
     
      
    19 In my view there is no substance in the contention that there was a failure to accord procedural fairness in these respects. It should be plain to litigants generally that when evidence is put before a Court it is submitted to adjudication, and the prospect that it may not be found convincing is quite evident and needs no warning. This was particularly true in the present case where the weakness in Ms Hodgson’s appraisal of the applicant’s life situation was plainly open to the interpretation made by her Honour; and was also true where the testimonials or references did not address the impact of participation in a fraudulent conspiracy on the views of the character referees. The outcome of her Honour’s consideration of this evidence cannot have been surprising and should not reasonably have been unexpected. In my view this ground should be rejected. 
     
      
    20 The fourth ground of appeal was:  
     
      
       
        
        The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      In support of this ground counsel referred to the maximum penalty for the substantive offence under s.178BA of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 which is five years. Counsel produced a table of comparative cases; these cases were convictions under s.178BA and did not relate to convictions for conspiracy. It was contended that while there was a degree of planning inherent in the nature of a charge of conspiracy, overall the offence was of the lower order for offences of this type. Counsel referred to the fact that the applicant’s previous convictions for the most part related to driving, and included only two prior matters of dishonesty. To my reading only one earlier conviction can be strictly said to be an offence of dishonesty. There are significant elements of social irresponsibility in driving while one’s licence is cancelled or while disqualified, and also in using an unregistered and an uninsured vehicle.  
       
      
    21 An offence against s.178BA is of course serious enough, but a conspiracy involving three persons is significantly more serious, and the applicant played the principal part in the conspiracy. Judge English’s expression was that the applicant was the mastermind. This was not an indication that the conspiracy was well planned, but that the applicant took the prime position in its planning. Although the conspiracy was defeated very soon by fortuitous intervention by police who were acting for a different purpose, and the participants revealed the events to the police fairly readily, there had been a real likelihood that the conspiracy might have succeeded and that a significant sum of money might have been diverted from the insurance company. The applicant was the leading spirit in a coldly fraudulent conspiracy directed to dishonestly obtaining a significant sum of money, exhibiting criminality of a significantly higher scale than had been shown in her earlier record.  
     
      
    22 It seems possible from Judge English’s brief reference to parity in the context of Mr Lewis that consideration of parity may have caused her Honour to rate down the sentence which she might have otherwise imposed on the applicant. However that may be, it would not be in my opinion be a correct conclusion that the sentence imposed was excessive in the circumstances. When regard is given to the nature of the offence, its circumstances including the applicant’s leading part in it, the favourable personal circumstances which appear from the character references, the plea of guilty made at the first opportunity, and to minor considerations being the apparent allowance for parity and the slightly favourable influence of the misinformation about the period spent in custody, the sentence imposed is well within the range of sentences which could be imposed in a sound exercise of discretion. I am not of opinion that any other sentence than that actually passed is warranted in law and should have been passed; see Criminal Appeal Act 1912 subs.6(3). In my opinion leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    23 JAMES J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Bryson JA and Kirby J. I agree generally with the judgment of Bryson JA, subject to the qualification that, with respect to the second ground of appeal and the question of special circumstances, I agree with Kirby J. I agree with the orders proposed by Bryson JA.  
     
      
    24 KIRBY J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Bryson JA in draft. I agree with the order proposed, that the appeal should be dismissed. For the reasons his Honour gives, I agree that there was no error in respect of grounds 1, 3 and 4. However, in respect of ground 2, I have reached the same conclusion by a slightly different path. 
     
      
    25 The Act in s44(2) makes provision for the ratio between the non parole period and the full term of the sentence. At the time of the offences, the section was in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        ""44(2) The non parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less, in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision."" 
        
       
      
    26 Where the material presented on sentence is capable of being regarded as giving rise to special circumstances, the sentencing Judge should deal with the issue under s44(2), exercising his or her discretion to vary or not to vary the statutory ratio. 
     
      
    27 If the Judge fails to deal with that issue there is error. The Judge will not have taken into account a material consideration in his or her determination (House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505). The appellate Court must then resentence. In doing so, it must determine whether special circumstances should be found, and the statutory ratio varied. 
     
      
    28 Where the remarks on sentence are silent as to the issue arising under s44(2), not mentioning special circumstances, and where the sentence is simply divided in accordance with the statutory ratio, an issue arises as to whether the Judge in fact exercised the discretion under s44(2). The remarks themselves, although not using the words ""special circumstances"", may make it clear that the issue was in the Judge's mind. Alternatively, submissions made shortly before the sentence was passed, may enable the Court to comfortably draw that inference. 
     
      
    29 Here the evidence tendered on sentence was, according to the applicant, capable of being regarded as amounting to special circumstances, namely the applicant's mature age, she having led a relatively blameless life until the break-down of her marriage at the age of 33, and her work with the Port Macquarie Sea Rescue Group. It was suggested that she may benefit from an extended period of supervision. 
     
      
    30 In R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, this Court identified the wide range of matters capable of constituting special circumstances. The material before her Honour was capable of being so regarded, in the sense that it raised the question of whether there should be a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    31 Neither the remarks on sentence, nor the submissions made by counsel before sentence advert to the issue of special circumstances. The sentence her Honour imposed was divided according to the statutory ratio. The same was true in respect of the sentences imposed upon co-offenders. The proper inference, I believe, was that the issue of special circumstances was not addressed. There was therefore error and the need for this Court to resentence. 
     
      
    32 Addressing that issue, I am not persuaded, however, that the circumstances identified by the applicant should be regarded as special circumstances. I would therefore not disturb the statutory ratio.

    1 BRYSON JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: Steven Wayne Bugmy (""the applicant"") seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Finnane DCJ on 21 February 2003. Mr Bugmy pleaded guilty to two counts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s59 Crimes Act 1900). 
        
       
       
      Count 2:  
      Affray (s93C Crimes Act 1900). 
       
      
    4 The maximum penalty for each offence was five years imprisonment. The offences were committed on 7 April 2002. Mr Bugmy had been in custody since 16 April 2002, a period of a little over ten months. Taking account of that time, his Honour imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 2 
         (the affray): A fixed term of imprisonment of nine months from 16 April 2002 to 15 January 2003. 
        
       
       
        
      Count 1  
      (assault occasioning actual bodily harm): Imprisonment for two years from 16 January 2003 to 15 January 2005, such term to be suspended from 21 February 2003, upon Mr Bugmy entering a bond under s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, such bond to be subject to a number of conditions. 
       
       
      The grounds of appeal. 
       
      
    5 The written submissions of counsel for Mr Bugmy raise a number of issues. Paraphrasing those submissions, the complaints against the sentences appear to be as follows: 
     
      
    · First, that the sentence in respect of each offence was excessive. 
     
      
    · Secondly, that his Honour was in error in wholly accumulating the two sentences. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, that the conditions imposed under the s12 bond were unduly onerous. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, that it was inappropriate and unsatisfactory that his Honour should have required the applicant to seek his Honour's permission to return to Wilcannia during the currency of the bond. 
     
      
       
      The offences. 
       
      
    6 Mr Bugmy was one of three individuals involved in a brawl at a cafe at the Shell Service Station at Wilcannia. The incident occurred shortly after 8.00 pm on 7 April 2002 as the cafe was about to close. Robert Shepherd and Steven Williams were also involved. They too were charged with affray. In addition, Mr Shepherd was charged with malicious wounding (s35(a) Crimes Act) and Mr Williams with malicious wounding with intent (s33 Crimes Act). 
     
      
    7 During the course of the day, Mr Bugmy and his companions had drunk a number of casks of wine. Mr Shepherd went to the cafe and asked for two dim sims. It was plain to the shopkeeper that he had insufficient money. He asked for credit, which was refused. He then began shouting angrily at the person behind the counter. His actions and words were captured on video surveillance maintained at the premises. 
     
      
    8 Mr Shepherd left the premises, promising to return. He did so with Mr Bugmy and Mr Williams. Finnane DCJ, who saw the video, described what happened thereafter in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""All three of them became involved in arguments with this man, the shop assistant, and also subsequently with Mr Bellos. The video film showed Mr Bugmy beckoning the other two away at various points. They each came back. Mr Bugmy continued arguing, though it was unclear to me precisely why he wanted to continue arguing with the people in the shop. Shepherd and Williams, notwithstanding Mr Bugmy pushing them out of the premises on one occasion and directing them out, came back a number of times and both of them in the presence of the offender struck the two men behind the counter at the same time as they shouted and yelled abuse at them. That striking whilst shouting and yelling abuse was the foundational fact behind the offence of affray to which all three ultimately pleaded guilty. Mr Bugmy himself did not strike the men behind the counter but he participated in what they were doing by standing there and joining in the arguments that they were joining in."" 
        
       
      
    9 In the course of the affray, Mr Williams produced a knife. It had been concealed in his trousers. Mr Bugmy did not see him do so. His Honour specifically found that he was not aware that Mr Williams had a knife. 
     
      
    10 The shopkeeper, Mr Bellos, responded by arming himself with a baseball bat, attempting to frighten the intruders off. The video showed the men leaving the shop. However, they soon returned. Mr Shepherd hurled a garbage tin lid at Mr Bellos. Mr Bugmy then tackled Mr Bellos, using what the sentencing Judge described as a ""rugby style tackle"" (giving rise to count 1, the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm). Mr Bellos was knocked off his feet. He was driven some distance along the floor, out of sight of the camera. Mr Williams then stabbed him. Mr Bellos clearly let go of the baseball bat which one of the offenders used to strike him. There was no evidence as to who was responsible for the blows with the baseball bat. Specifically, in relation to Mr Bugmy, his Honour made the following finding: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am unable to conclude that Mr Bugmy hit him with the baseball bat."" 
        
       
      
    11 However, in respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (count 1), his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He has pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm in respect of this matter. There is evidence before me that satisfies me that Mr Bellos suffered bruising on various parts of his body and a graze on one of his arms. The bruising and the graze could well have been caused as a result of his being tackled. That alone could have produced that. That would of course amount to actual bodily harm."" 
        
       
      
    12 The shopkeeper, Mr Bellos was taken to hospital. Apart from bruising, he had a 1 cm stab wound to the left scapula region, requiring four stitches under local anaesthetic. He had a further laceration to the right parietal region, likewise requiring four stitches. There was a further 1 cm laceration to his left lower lip and a 0.5 cm laceration to the mucus membrane of his left upper lip, presumably the consequence of a punch or punches. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Sentences excessive. 
       
      
    13 Before dealing with the offences, it may be useful to describe Mr Bugmy's subjective case. He was born on 4 February 1975. At the time of the offences he was 28 years old. He was one of six children. He was raised by his parents in Wilcannia, where he has a large extended family. He lived in an area known as ""the mallee"". The Probation and Parole report included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""His father has always been in full time employment and although Mr Bugmy appeared to have enjoyed a good upbringing it appears that alcohol abuse has been prevalent in his family over the years."" 
        
       
      
    14 Mr Bugmy attended school in Wilcannia until the age of 16 years. His Honour said this: (ROS 8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The fact of this background has meant that he has never really worked, although his father had worked. Two of his brothers have served periods of imprisonment. He at various stages has wandered around Australia but has no real skills. He did a course in horticulture but did not complete it. He is, as far as I can tell, able to read and write but he is not well educated. He has a background of deprivation and hopelessness that people who are not of Aboriginal background find difficult to understand."" 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour remarked that Mr Bugmy was entitled to have the Court take account of those matters identified by Wood J in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. 
     
      
    16 Mr Bugmy had a long history of alcohol and drug abuse. He began sniffing petrol, using marijuana and abusing alcohol at the age of 14. He quickly accumulated a criminal record. Many of his offences were alcohol related. He was brought before the Children's Court on a number of occasions. He was placed on probation and made the subject of control orders. In May 1994 he was dealt with as an adult and convicted of assault. He was placed on a bond. In August 1995 he was dealt with in the Broken Hill Local Court for assault and attempting to steal. He was ordered to perform 60 hours community service in respect of each count. In January 1996 he was again convicted of a series of offences, including assault and two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was ordered to perform a total of 500 hours of community service and placed upon a bond.  
     
      
    17 In August 1996 he was again convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (two counts). On this occasion he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a 10 month minimum term with an additional term of 18 months. In October 1996 he was dealt with for further charges of assault and a number of breaches of an apprehended violence order. Short terms of imprisonment were imposed. 
     
      
    18 On 21 November 1996 Mr Bugmy was dealt with for a breach of his parole. He was imprisoned for the period between 10 October 1996 and 20 February 1998. 
     
      
    19 In 1999, Mr Bugmy was charged once more with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (two counts). On each count he was sentenced to a fixed term of one month. At the same time he was charged with two further counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sentenced to fixed terms of imprisonment of three months in respect of each. In February 2002 Mr Bugmy was convicted of having resisted an officer in the execution of his duty (two counts) and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In respect of the former, he was placed upon a bond for 12 months, and in respect of the assault he was sentenced to imprisonment for six months, such term being suspended upon his entering into a bond which included a requirement that he submit to the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service. It was a condition of his bond that he attend a TAFE and receive counselling. However, on 6 May 2002 he was again convicted of assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty (two counts), as well as maliciously destroying or damaging property to the value of $2,000. He was sentenced on each count to imprisonment for one month. 
     
      
    20 The present offence, like many before it, was committed at a time when Mr Bugmy was heavily intoxicated with alcohol. However, Mr Bugmy's outlook was not entirely bleak. He at least recognised that he had a problem. Whilst in custody in 1997, he had successfully completed a Drug and Alcohol Relapse Prevention Programme. The Probation and Parole report submitted to the sentencing Judge included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A further report dated 27 May 1997 from the Far West area Health Service indicated that Mr Bugmy was 'self referred' to that Service. The reason he gave 'was his concern about his history of alcohol abuse and the subsequent problems this behaviour brought with it'. The following comments were made in that report. 'It has been encouraging to witness the positive changes Steven has made. He is very much aware that he needs to avoid situations that could be a risk to him maintaining his present direction.'"" 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour accepted that Mr Bugmy regretted his actions. He had pleaded guilty. He was entitled to a discount which his Honour stated was ""usually of the order of 20 to 25 percent"". 
     
      
    22 Turning to the offences, his Honour described the offence of affray in these terms: (ROS 2) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have earlier said in remarks on sentence on 17 December 2002 when I sentenced Mr Williams and Mr Shepherd that the affray was a serious matter, as it involved the assaults on two persons of the three who were keeping open a Shell service station in Wilcannia, a remote town in the State of New South Wales."" 
        
       
      
    23 Nonetheless, there were matters which plainly differentiated Mr Bugmy from his co-offenders. First, he had endeavoured to persuade his companions to leave the cafe. Indeed, at one point he had pushed them out the door. Secondly, it was Mr Shepherd and Mr Williams who physically struck Mr Bellos, not Mr Bugmy, although Mr Bugmy associated himself with the affray in the manner described by his Honour. 
     
      
    24 Whilst it is important in sentencing for affray to identify the offender's role, the seriousness of the offence reflects, to some degree, the actions of co-offenders whom the offender chose to join. This recognises that in an affray offenders ""feed off each other"". Aggression begets aggression. 
     
      
    25 Whilst his Honour may have imposed a lesser sentence than nine months imprisonment for the affray (having regard to Mr Bugmy's largely passive role before the rugby tackle (which gave rise to the first count)), the sentence was not, in my view, outside the discretion his Honour had. 
     
      
    26 The assault occasioning actual bodily harm was described by his Honour in these terms: (ROS 10) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In relation to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, he deliberately and directly attacked a man who was lawfully in a shop. He had no reason to do it. The proper course for him to take when that man produced a baseball bat to defend himself was to leave the premises."" 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour found that his actions were impulsive. It was said on behalf of Mr Bugmy that, in truth, he was acting defensively after he saw Mr Bellos raise the baseball bat. Such a submission is somewhat at odds with the plea of guilty to the offence. It was Mr Bellos, the shopkeeper, who was defending himself and his property, in the face of Mr Williams who had produced the knife. There was no warrant for the action of Mr Bugmy. 
     
      
    28 The offence was plainly serious. The criminal history of Mr Bugmy, which included many assaults, could not be ignored. Howie J, reflecting the principle in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477, explained the relevance of an offender's record in these terms (R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253): (para 31) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The effect of the prior criminal record of the offender, where it is relevant to sentencing, is not to increase the objective seriousness of the offence committed but rather that retribution, deterrence and protection of society may indicate a more severe sentence is warranted."" 
        
       
      
    29 Here, his Honour imposed a suspended sentence of two years conditional upon Mr Bugmy entering a bond (s12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). The suspension operated from the date of the sentencing hearing (21 February 2003), although the sentence commenced a month earlier (16 January 2003). The sentence, therefore, combined a term of imprisonment (which had already been served) (16.1.03 to 21.2.03), with the suspension of the remainder of the two year term. That was, at the time, an approach open to his Honour (Gamgee (2001) 124 A Crim R 469, per Mason P and Dowd J, Sully J (dis)). 
     
      
    30 In suspending the sentence on the day that it was passed (so that Mr Bugmy would be released at once), his Honour was plainly extending some leniency to Mr Bugmy. His order sought, appropriately, to deal with the time already served. It was plainly open to his Honour to select the term of two years as an appropriate term, having regard to the nature of the offence and the supervision he had in mind. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Accumulation 
       
      
    31 The second ground is directed at the accumulation of the sentences. It was suggested that the sentences ought to have been concurrent, or at least partially concurrent. 
     
      
    32 The principle which should guide this aspect of the sentencing discretion was stated by Simpson J in R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 in these terms: (at 67) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is, in the end, an exercise of discretion to be made in accordance with established principle. Features common to two or more offences are all matters relevant to be taken into account (pointing towards concurrence) as are features indicating the disparate nature of the offences (pointing the other way). There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong."" 
        
       
      
    33 Here, there were certainly matters which suggested concurrence, or partial concurrence. The offences were committed at approximately the same time and at the same place. Indeed, the assault, the subject of count 1, occurred during the course of the affray. When sentencing Messrs Shepherd and Williams, his Honour made the sentences he imposed upon them in respect of the affray partially concurrent with the sentences he imposed in respect of the other charges. 
     
      
    34 Having said that, I do not believe his Honour was bound to make the sentences concurrent or partially concurrent. His Honour was obliged to deal with the totality of Mr Bugmy's criminality. He had plainly determined that he should be released on a bond immediately, making provision under the bond for supervision. In these circumstances, I believe it was open to him to make the sentences cumulative. I would therefore not find error. 
     
      
    35 I would reject ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 3 and 4: The conditions of the bond. 
       
      
    36 It is convenient to restate grounds 3 and 4 and deal with them together. They were: 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The conditions imposed under the s12 bond were unduly onerous. 
       
       
      Ground 4: It was inappropriate and unsatisfactory that his Honour should have required the applicant to seek his Honour's permission to return to Wilcannia during the currency of the bond. 
       
      
    37 The suspended sentence in respect of count 1 was passed pursuant to s12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which at that time was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Suspended sentences 
        
       
       
        
        12(1) A court that imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender (being a sentence for a term of not more than 2 years) may make an order: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) suspending execution of the sentence for such period (not exceeding the term of the sentence) as the court may specify in the order, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) directing that the offender be released from custody on condition that the offender enters into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding the term of the sentence."" 
        
       
      
    38 His Honour specified the conditions of the bond as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) That the offender submits to supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for the whole of the period of the suspended sentence. He is to report to the officer-in-charge of the Probation and Parole Service at Broken Hill within seven days of today. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) He is to reside at an address at Broken Hill which is notified to the Adult Probation Service. ... 
        
       
       
        
        (3) He is to submit to such counselling and other programmes as the Adult Probation Service require him to do and to attend such rehabilitation programmes as they may require him to attend. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) He is to remain away from Wilcannia during the term of this sentence unless he has, upon prior application to me, been permitted to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) During the period of the sentence he is to be of good behaviour. ..."" 
        
       
      
    39 Grounds 3 and 4 are directed to condition (4). The genesis of that condition is to be found in the Probation and Parole report, which included these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Bugmy who was born in Broken Hill and raised in Wilcannia where the majority of his family still reside, is the third eldest in a family of six children. He left home at the age of 17 years however he has always remained in contact with his family and had their support. ... it appears that alcohol abuse has been prevalent in his family over the years. ... Mr Bugmy said he travelled throughout Australia after he left home although he returns to Wilcannia to visit his family or to attend events such as funerals which are important with the aboriginal culture."" 
        
       
      
    40 The report continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... However Mr Bugmy believes he is more likely to deal with his abuse of alcohol away from his associates and some of his extended family members who live in the Broken Hill/Wilcannia area. He claimed he has relatives in the Albury area who would provide a more constructive and 'sober' environment for him and he would prefer to reside within that area."" 
        
       
      
    41 The Probation and Parole report then referred to the steps taken by Mr Bugmy to address his problem with alcohol. It added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Bugmy is aware that he must take steps to address his problems which related primarily to abuse of alcohol  
        however it is apparent on his past history this is unlikely to be achieved if he remains in the Wilcannia area. 
         Any previous benefits he may have achieved by attending to programs which address problems such as alcohol abuse appear to have been negated by his maintaining association with people who may have similar problems. He appears genuine in his desire to deal with his problems and is prepared to move away from that area. However unless Mr Bugmy can develop sufficient personal strengths to withstand pressures which will undoubtedly come from his associates and some family members this will be difficult to achieve."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    42 In his remarks on sentence, Finanne DCJ made the following observation relevant to the danger which Wilcannia posed for Mr Bugmy: (ROS p8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... there is largely nothing to do in Wilcannia. There are no sporting teams, there are no recreational activities, and for young men the unfortunate fact is that they grow up in an environment where both men and women spend a great deal of their time drinking alcohol. I mention those facts because in effect that drinking of alcohol is the only form of recreation in Wilcannia. That is a sad statement to make about any place."" 
        
       
      
    43 His Honour added: (ROS p9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Probation and Parole Service consider that he is aware of the need to take steps to address his problems, and they consider that he is genuine in his desire to deal with the problems and that he is prepared to move away from Wilcannia."" 
        
       
      
    44 His Honour therefore reached the following conclusion: (ROS p13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""He has got to stay away from Wilcannia during the term of the sentence; not set foot in the place at all. If he does, he will be brought before me in Sydney and I will deal with him. It is my policy never to ask for another judge to deal with somebody who breaches a suspended sentence or a good behaviour bond."" 
        
       
      
    45 However, his Honour recognised that Mr Bugmy may need to attend the funeral of a relative. He said this: (ROS p13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I acknowledge that there are obligations imposed on all Aboriginal people to attend funerals. I would not do anything to stop Mr Bugmy attending a funeral in Wilcannia, but I would be requiring him to get my consent before he did it; not just turn up. If he turned up for a funeral he could anticipate the consent would be given on strict conditions. It would mean he would go and he would return, and he would get into no trouble in Wilcannia. There is only one way he could stay out of trouble in Wilcannia and that would be to refrain from drinking."" 
        
       
      
    46 Mr Bugmy had plainly altered his view since speaking to the Probation and Parole Service. It was said on his behalf that condition (4) was unreasonable and unduly onerous. Mr Bugmy's family and extended family lived in the Wilcannia area. He has other connections with that town. The requirement that he seek the Judge's permission to return to Wilcannia for a funeral was ""cumbersome"". It inevitably involved delay. During the currency of the bond, Mr Bugmy has twice been obliged to seek permission to return to Wilcannia. On each occasion he approached the Legal Aid Office to assist in obtaining the Judge's consent. Legal Aid does not ordinarily extend to such assistance. However, it was provided in the circumstances by a solicitor pro bono. Permission was given by Finnane DCJ on one occasion and by the Chief Judge on another (presumably because Finnane DCJ was not available). That permission was subject to Mr Bugmy leaving Wilcannia immediately after the funeral. It was submitted that, as a matter of public policy, such supervision by the Court was undesirable. 
     
      
    47 The Crown submitted that condition (4) was appropriate. A condition need only relate to some aspect of punishment or rehabilitation. Here it was plainly designed to serve the interests of Mr Bugmy's rehabilitation. It was acknowledged that the condition was unusual. Counsel could not call to mind a similar condition. However, the fact that it was unusual did not, in the Crown's submission, make the condition invalid. 
     
      
    48 Part 8 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 deals with the procedure when imposing a good behaviour bond. The conditions which may or must be included in a bond are set out in section 95. That section is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        95 Good behaviour bonds 
        
       
       
        
        A good behaviour bond: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) must contain a condition to the effect that the offender to whom the bond relates (the  
        person under bond 
        ) will appear before the court if called on to do so at any time during the term of the bond, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) must contain a condition to the effect that, during the term of the bond, the person under bond: 
        
       
       
        
         (i) will be of good behaviour, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) will inform the registrar or clerk of the court by which the bond is imposed of any change in the person's residential address, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) may contain such other conditions as are specified in the order by which the bond is imposed, other than conditions requiring the person under bond: 
        
       
       
        
         (i) to perform community service work, or 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) to make any payment, whether in the nature of a fine, compensation or otherwise."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    49 Section 98 is concerned with the breach, or suspected breach, by an offender of one or more of the conditions imposed under a bond. The section is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""98 Proceedings for breach of good behaviour bond 
        
       
       
        
        (1) If it suspects that an offender may have failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the court with which the offender has entered into the bond, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (b) any other court of like jurisdiction, 
        
       
       
        
         may call on the offender to appear before it and, if the offender does not appear, may issue a warrant for the offender's arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If it is satisfied that an offender appearing before it has failed to comply with any of the conditions of a good behaviour bond, a court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) may decide to take no action with respect to the failure to comply, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) may vary the conditions of the bond or impose further conditions on the bond, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (c) may revoke the bond. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in section 12, a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the offender's failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender's failure to comply with the conditions of the bond."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    50 Given the broad nature of the discretion under s95(c), can it be said that condition (4) is beyond power or inappropriate? What limitations, if any, are there upon the exercise of that power? In Allen Commercial Constructions Pty Ltd v North Sydney Municipal Council  (1970) 123 CLR 490, the Court was dealing with a broad discretion conferred upon a Local Council to grant development approval unconditionally, or subject to ""such conditions as it may think proper to impose"", or to refuse an application (clause 40(1) of the North Sydney Planning Scheme Ordinance). Walsh J (with whom other members of the Court agreed) said this: (at 499) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In accordance with a well-recognized rule, s40(1) ought to be understood (quite apart from the limitation contained in its opening words) not as giving an unlimited discretion as to the conditions which may be imposed, but as conferring a power to impose conditions which are reasonably capable of being regarded as related to the purpose for which the function of the authority is being exercised, as ascertained from a consideration of the scheme and of the Act under which it is made."" 
        
       
      
    51 In Macpherson v Beath (1975) 12 SASR 174, a Special Magistrate imposed a two year bond with certain conditions. There was an appeal by the person who was subject to those conditions. He was a university student. He had been convicted of having assaulted a lecturer at the university. It required the defendant ""to be of good behaviour and to obey the reasonable directions of, and be at all times courteous to, members of the administrative and teaching staff of any educational institution which he may be attending"". 
     
      
    52 Bray CJ, having referred to the Act which gave the power to impose a bond, said this: (at 180) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The present condition is obviously not authorised by sub-sections (a) or (b). It can be justified, if at all, only under the words in sub-s (c) about 'such additional conditions with respect to ... any other matters, as the court may, having regard to the circumstances of the case, consider necessary or desirable for preventing a repetition of the same offence or the commission of other offences.' 
        
       
       
        
        I think this condition is bad for several reasons. In the first place I think it is too uncertain to be enforced and hence oppressive. The appellant must be able to know just what conduct during the next two years will subject him to automatic incarceration. What directions are 'reasonable'? What does 'courteous' mean in this context? Standards of courtesy vary. Must he get to his feet every time a lecturer enters the room and address him or her as 'Sir' or 'Madam', as the case may be?"" 
        
       
      
    53 The Chief Justice believed that the condition could not reasonably be regarded as ""necessary or desirable for preventing a repetition of the assault"" (at 181). Rather, it ""was designed to bend the defendant's unruly will and force him to conform to conventional standards of politeness under threat of gaol"" (at 181). The power given could not be used for that purpose. The Chief Justice added: (at 181) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have more than once deprecated the tendency to insert unusual conditions into recognizances designed to control the defendant's private life in contexts only indirectly related, if at all, to the crime for which he is being punished. I have allowed appeals against such conditions: see  
        Neil v Steel 
         (1973) 5 SASR 67;  
        Baddock v Steel 
         (1973) 5 SASR 71. To my mind they tend to savour of excessive paternalism and in extreme cases of tyranny. I realise that views differ on this matter, but mine are strongly held."" 
        
       
      
    54 Zelling and Jacobs JJ agreed. Jacobs J added: (at 183) 
     
      
       
        
        ""With all respect to the learned Special Magistrate, and without in any way criticising the purpose which he had in mind, I am constrained to think that a condition 'to obey the reasonable direction, and be at all times courteous, to members of the administrative and teaching staff' of a specified educational institution, is at worst too vague and too uncertain to be enforceable, and at best, too wide. Conduct which may constitute a breach of the bond should be capable of reasonably clear definition."" 
        
       
      
    55 In Williams v Marsh (1985) 38 SASR 313, Cox J had occasion to consider a similar issue. The appellant had been convicted of behaving in a disorderly manner at Colley Reserve at Glenelg. A Special Magistrate imposed a bond that he be of good behaviour for twelve months and that during that period ""he not attend the Glenelg foreshore area"". The appellant entered the bond in those terms. However, he later sought relief from the condition relating to the foreshore area, which was said to be ""unduly harsh"" and ""inappropriate"". 
     
      
    56 The Crown, in the words of Cox J, raised ""no great opposition"" to the appeal being allowed, submitting that the condition was superfluous. It really did not add anything to the requirement that the appellant be of good behaviour. However, Cox J said this: (at 315) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the responsibility for deciding on the right penalty in any particular case is, in the end, that of the court. The learned Special Magistrate who dealt with the appellant's case evidently considered that more was needed than the usual conditions about keeping the peace and being of good behaviour. He thought that it was desirable to keep the appellant out of the area where the offence took place for the period of the bond, and that s70ab enabled him to impose a condition to that effect. So far as the principle of the matter is concerned, I see no reason to disagree with him."" 
        
       
      
    57 His Honour observed that the power to impose conditions was unqualified by the terms of the legislation. The Court, in his view, should be wary of reading limitations into the legislation that Parliament had not chosen to prescribe for itself. Cox J added: (at 316) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Obviously any additional conditions that a court might decide to include in any particular case should be appropriate to the circumstances of the offence and the offender in question and, as with all forms of punishment, be no more than the circumstances reasonably require. It will never be proper to impose conditions that will operate harshly or unreasonably, or which may fairly be thought to be merely intrusive or officious. Certainly they will need to be directly related to the offence which led to their imposition. It would not be a proper use of s70ab for the court merely to take the opportunity offered by a man's conviction to attempt a general reform of his character that might be thought desirable. It is a power to be used with circumspection.""  
        
       
      
    58 His Honour was not persuaded that the condition in the bond was oppressive or improper in the circumstances (at 316). He was concerned, however, that the condition was too imprecise (at 319). The ""foreshore"" was not defined. His Honour therefore revised the condition. The appellant should not, during the currency of the bond, ""enter upon Moseley Square or Colley Reserve at Glenelg"" (at 320). 
     
      
    59 In R v Harvey (1989) 40 A Crim R 102, Ms Harvey pleaded guilty to a charge of cultivating a prohibited plant, contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The sentencing Judge imposed a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of five years. It was a condition of the bond that Ms Harvey report to the police each day, Monday to Friday, between the hours of 8.00 am and 8.00 pm, and that she accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. Application was made to the Court of Criminal Appeal to quash the order requiring Ms Harvey to report daily to the police. Lee J (Wood and Grove JJ agreeing), having stated that neither counsel was aware of a similar order having been made in the context of a bond, added: (at 103/104) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... One finds it very commonly, of course, when bail is allowed and its purpose there is plainly twofold, essentially to ensure the attendance of the accused at trial but also to act as a deterrent against further criminal activity during that period. Such an order in my view always has that secondary operation upon the prisoner. 
        
       
       
        
        In my view his Honour had the power to make such an order and in this particular case, involving as it did a planned enterprise in regard to cultivation of a prohibited drug, I am not prepared to say that his Honour was in error in turning his mind to the possible deterrent effect of the making of such an order. I am, however, strongly of the opinion that his Honour did err in requiring the order to operate during the entire period of the recognisance. It was, in my opinion, in that respect needlessly onerous. The applicant was required to report to the Probation and Parole Service and would get the supervision offered by that Service and I cannot see that reporting to the police for the whole period stated served any purpose at all. As the applicant has in fact carried out the order for a period now since it was made last October, it seems to me that it would be appropriate for this Court to quash the order so that no further reporting to the police is required. Of course, the other conditions of the recognisance would still stand."" 
        
       
      
    60 Grove J, whilst agreeing that the time had come to remove the requirement of reporting (four months having elapsed since the condition was imposed), said this: (at 104) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I do not think it is an appealable error to make such an order at all and I imagine, although I cannot immediately contemplate, that there may be some circumstances in which an order of this type could be apposite."" 
        
       
      
    61 What, then, are the principles to emerge from these authorities? 
     
      
    · First, the discretion as to conditions that may be attached to a bond is broad but not unlimited. The conditions must reasonably relate to the purpose of imposing a bond, that is, the punishment of a particular crime. They must therefore relate either to the character of that crime or the purposes of punishment for that crime, including deterrence and rehabilitation. 
     
      
    · Secondly, the conditions must each be certain, defining with reasonable precision conduct which is proscribed. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, the conditions should not in their operation be unduly harsh or unreasonable or needlessly onerous. 
     
      
    62 Did condition (4) offend these principles? The Probation and Parole report suggested that Mr Bugmy's offending behaviour, and indeed his criminal history of violence, was related to his abuse of alcohol. That, in turn, was linked to his associations in Wilcannia with certain family members and friends. Mr Bugmy, when interviewed by the Service, appeared to acknowledge that link and the need to remove himself from Wilcannia. 
     
      
    63 Finnane DCJ, in framing condition (4), was plainly addressing these issues. He no doubt hoped that Mr Bugmy's absence from Wilcannia would break the habit of alcohol abuse. It may therefore interrupt the cycle of abuse followed by criminal behaviour. Addressing what I have termed ""the first principle"" (supra para 59), condition (4) is plainly related to the crime being punished and the purposes of punishment, specifically rehabilitation. 
     
      
    64 However, was the condition sufficiently certain? The condition embodied a principle and made an exception. The principle was that during the term of the bond Mr Bugmy was not to enter Wilcannia. The exception was that he may enter if he first obtained the permission of the sentencing Judge. The principle, I believe, was certain. The conduct which would put Mr Bugmy in breach was clearly identified. However, the exception was quite uncertain. Although, in the remarks on sentence, there was discussion of the importance of funerals in Aboriginal culture, and the need for Mr Bugmy to attend such funerals, the condition, as framed, was not so limited. Without amendment it cannot, in my view, be allowed to stand. 
     
      
    65 However, with respect, the exception is unsatisfactory for other reasons. I would not read s95(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as authorising the sort of supervision contemplated by his Honour's order. Rather, that provision relates to s98(1), where it is suspected that the offender may have failed to comply with the conditions of the bond. There is no other provision which expressly empowers a judge to make an order with the sort of exception in condition (4). Nor would I imply such a power from other provisions in the Act. Essentially, the exception to condition (4) was administrative in character, not judicial. There is no defined procedure for making an application, no right for the Crown to be present, and no obvious right of appeal. Where permission is given by the Judge, does he have the power to impose conditions, as was done in this case? If so, what is the status of those conditions? Are they ""conditions"" for the purposes of the procedure in s98(1), where a breach is suspected? If not, what is the remedy if there is a breach? 
     
      
    66 In R v Sanerive (CCA (Vic), unreported, 23.6.95), the sentencing Judge made what was termed ""a community based order"", which is a form of non-custodial sentence. The order was subject to a number of conditions. Amongst other things, the offender was required to perform eight hours of unpaid community work each week for a period of five years. The order contemplated an annual report to the sentencing Judge from those responsible for community service ""as to the progress of the prisoner"". The offender was required to attend before the sentencing Judge on 12 February each year for the duration of the bond, when these issues would be reviewed. Ormiston J (with whom Southwell and McDonald JJ agreed) said this:  
     
      
       
        
        ""... the order as a whole was oppressive. Although, as I have said, orders may exceed two years, this order was designed not merely to be carried out over five years but to require the performance of each of the conditions, other than those relating to education, over a five year period. Not only did that require the supervision by a community corrections officer but in the present case there was further supervision of the applicant on an annual basis directed by the judge. Although in theory such a condition might be open on the legislation, in fact it misconceives the nature and duty of the sentencing court and the role of the supervising court. The object of the legislative scheme is that supervision should be carried out by qualified officers on an administrative basis. It is highly undesirable that courts should take on the role of actively administering such orders. Whatever the virtues of case management in the civil jurisdiction of the courts (and even to an extent in the criminal jurisdiction), a judge should not take on the role of both prosecutor and sentencer unless legislation clearly and unambiguously requires a judge to do so."" 
        
       
      
    67 His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""However well intentioned it may have been, the imposition of this condition of judicial supervision would appear to have confused the role of prosecutor and sentencing judge in a way which should not occur whether under the 1985 or 1991 Acts."" 
        
       
      
    68 Although there are differences between that case and the present case, ordinarily one would expect that once a sentence had been imposed, and the order entered (recording the conditions of the bond), the Judge's role would end (cf Lapa (No 2) (1995) 80 A Crim R 398 at 402/403, per Clarke JA (Handley JA and Sully J agreeing); Miroslav Jovanovic  (1999) 106 A Crim R 548, per Wilcox, Miles and Weinberg JJ at 551-559). Specific provision is made where a breach of the conditions of the bond is suspected (s98(1) (supra para 47)) However, that provision confers the power on the Court (as defined by s3), not the Judge who imposed the bond, although by convention a suspected breach may be referred back to the Judge who imposed the bond. 
     
      
    69 Here, any exception to the prohibition against entry into Wilcannia had to be expressed with certainty, and its administration handed to the Probation and Parole Service, being the body responsible for Mr Bugmy's day to day supervision. 
     
      
    70 Assuming that were done, would such a condition offend against what I have termed ""the third principle"" (supra para 59)? Should such a condition be characterised as unduly harsh or unreasonable or needlessly onerous? If the condition were to provide that an offender should not see his family, it would plainly be unacceptable. Such a condition would not in any obvious way relate to the offence or the purposes of punishment. It would be both harsh and unreasonable. Here Mr Bugmy's family and extended family lived in an area of Wilcannia known as The Mallee. They were said to be poor. Wilcannia is an isolated town in the north west of New South Wales. It is a long way from other major centres. Was the practical effect of exclusion from Wilcannia a severance of the physical link between Mr Bugmy and his family? 
     
      
    71 His Honour, in the exception provided, plainly recognised that, at least in the context of funerals, such a condition would be too harsh. He sought to ameliorate the operation of that condition by permitting Mr Bugmy to make application to him. However, in my view, the exception, even if properly framed, and appropriately administered by the Probation and Parole Service, would still be harsh and unreasonable. The term of the bond was almost two years. That is a long time to exclude or effectively exclude a person from normal physical contact with his family. Even in prison family members are permitted to visit. Whilst it was open to his Honour, in the interests of Mr Bugmy's rehabilitation, and appropriately protecting the community, to provide for his exclusion from Wilcannia for a short period (say six months), two years was too long. A short period may have given Mr Bugmy the respite from alcohol abuse that may have enabled him to have successfully tackled his problem. A two year exclusion from Wilcannia, in my view, was akin to ""a general reform of his character"" (cf Cox J in Williams v Marsh (supra) at 316). The condition was, in my opinion, unduly harsh and unreasonable.  
     
      
    72 The sentence was imposed on 21 February 2003. The bond has almost run its course. For what remains of the bond, I would quash condition (4). Mr Bugmy may, if he wishes, return to Wilcannia. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    73 The order I propose is as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal is granted. 
       
       
      2. The appeal is allowed in respect of condition (4) of the bond which is hereby quashed. The sentence imposed by Finnane DCJ on 21 February 2003 is otherwise confirmed.

     Regina v Trent John Lenthall aka Michael York 
    On 31 October 2003 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for five years and three months for aggravated break and enter with intent to steal arising from driving a vehicle ram raid style into a service station. The non-parole period was set at two years and six months. The applicant seeks to appeal against this sentence as lacking parity with the sentence received by his co-accused who was given three years periodic detention with a non-parole period of two years and three months. Additionally or alternatively he claims his sentence was manifestly excessive. Ground 1 – The difference in the penalty imposed on the co-offender gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant. The relevant principle is stated in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 98 A Crim R 134. The Court must be satisfied that a justifiable sense of grievance has resulted from the sentencing of co-accused, after sufficient allowance has been made for any differences in their subjective and objective circumstances. Held: His Honour fell into error in his assessment of the culpability of the two offenders through categorising the subject offence at different levels of seriousness in the separate reasons for sentence. The differences in the head sentences and in the manner in which they were to be served was disproportionate to the differences in their objective and subjective circumstances. Leave to appeal is granted. Ground 2 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive Held: The applicant’s genuine attempts to rehabilitate were not sufficiently addressed by his Honour. It was a significant factor; it could be accepted that he had reached the “crossroads,” a principle allowing for leniency for offenders to whom leniency would not normally attach, for the purposes of encouraging reform: R v Osenkowski (1982) 5 A Crim R 394 and R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. This principle is always to be subject to careful consideration by the Court to disallow for wishful thinking: R v Govinder (1999) 106 A Crim R 314. In conjunction with the matter of parity in sentencing, the head sentence and non-parole period will be reduced. Orders:1. Leave to appeal against the sentence granted;2. Sentence below quashed, and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 18 February 2003, and expiring on 17 November 2006.3. Non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months fixed, to commence on 18 February 2003 and to expire on 17 December 2004.4. Vary the commencement date of the sentences imposed in the Blacktown Local Court on 16 December 2003, each being sentences for fixed terms of 4 months, in so far as they are now to commence on 18 December 2004 and to expire on 17 April 2005.

     Regina v Trent John Lenthall aka Michael York 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty at the Hornsby Local Court, on 13 June 2003, to a charge of aggravated break and enter with intent to steal (s 113(2) Crimes Act 1900), and was committed for sentence in the District Court. On 31 October 2003, his Honour Judge Dodd sentenced him to imprisonment for five years and three months to commence on 18 February 2003 and to expire on 17 May 2008, with a non-parole period of two years and six months, also to commence from 18 February 2003 and to expire on 17 August 2005. Offences of possessing house breaking implements, take and drive conveyance, and larceny of license plates were taken into account on a Form 1. Additionally, the applicant was ordered to pay compensation to the owner of the motor vehicle that was damaged in the course of the break and enter.  
     
      
    2 A co-accused Michael Mancic was subsequently sentenced by his Honour for the offence of aggravated break and enter with intent, taking into account an offence of knowingly being conveyed, to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and three months, to be served by way of periodic detention.  
     
      
    3 The plea of guilty was held to have been offered at the earliest opportunity, and as such the applicant was given a discount of 25%. Special circumstances were found, referable to the applicant’s age, to his personal history and deprived background, and to the fact that he was serving the sentence on protection. A need for a longer period than usual for post release supervision was also found. 
     
      
    4 In sentencing the applicant his Honour expressly took into account a substantial body of evidence, involving testimony from the applicant himself, as to his background and to the rehabilitation efforts, which he appeared to have made, since going back into custody, and which were found to give some hope for the future. To those aspects of the case I will return, but they were obviously taken carefully into account by his Honour when fixing a non-parole period that equated to approximately 48% of the head sentence.  
     
      
    5 The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence, which, it is asserted, lacks parity with that imposed on Mancic, and which additionally, or alternatively, is said to have been manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    6 On 18 February 2003 the applicant and two other offenders, one of whom was Mancic, drove to the Shell service station on Eastern Valley Way, in a stolen Subaru. The applicant was the driver.  
     
      
    7 When they arrived the applicant drove the vehicle, in ram-raid style, into the doorframe to the shop, shattering the glass. Once access was obtained, Mancic and the other man used a crow bar to strike a roller shutter covering a cigarette display.  
     
      
    8 Police arrived on the scene promptly, at which point the applicant accelerated the Subaru, stopping metres short of the police vehicle. He accelerated in reverse, striking and dislodging a petrol bowser from its foundations. He next selected a forward gear and accelerated at a sufficiently rapid rate to cause the vehicle’s tyres to smoke. A police officer deployed OC Capsicum spray disabling the applicant and Mancic. The remaining offender made an escape and has not been identified.  
     
      
    9 The Subaru was found to have registration plates affixed that had been stolen from another vehicle. Its ignition barrel and stereo unit had been removed. It was damaged in the course of the incident and it was this damage which led to the compensation order. The proprietor of the service station did not seek compensation for the damage occasioned to it, which was estimated to have been in the order of $10,000.  
     
      
    10 The circumstances of aggravation in relation to the s 113(2) offence, which carries a maximum period of imprisonment for 14 years, was that it occurred in company.  
     
      
    11 On 25 November 2003, the applicant was sentenced in the Hornsby Local Court for offences of driving while disqualified and reckless driving, which resulted in fixed terms of nine months, which were directed to be served concurrently with the sentence under appeal. These offences related to the manner in which, and circumstances in which the applicant drove the Subaru on the occasion which brought him before his Honour. The Form 1 offences were similarly related to this occasion.  
     
      
    12 On 16 December 2003 the applicant was sentenced in the Blacktown Local Court to concurrent sentences, each of four months, for quite separate offences of maliciously destroying property, assault, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which were directed to commence upon the expiry of the non-parole period for the present offence, effectively extending it by four months. The result is that he now faces a head sentence of five years and three months, with a minimum period in custody of two years and 10 months, that is, a period equivalent to 54% of the head sentence.  
     
      
    13 It is accepted that in the event of this Court intervening and resentencing the applicant, it will be necessary for the commencement dates for the last mentioned sentences to be varied, in accordance with the power reserved to it under s 59(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances  
       
      
    14 The applicant was born, on his account, on 4 January 1977 (although the records state that his birth date was 4 February 1976). Assuming the correctness of his evidence he was aged 26 years at the time of the offence. He had accumulated an appalling prior record over the past 10 years, commencing with drug offences in 1994, and followed by four offences of break enter and steal and multiple other offences of larceny, stealing motor vehicles, goods in custody, malicious damage, take and drive conveyance, assault and firearm offences. Additionally he has had many convictions for serious motoring offences including driving at a speed and in a manner dangerous, drive while disqualified, and drive while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. He has had his parole revoked more than once as a result of reoffending while on parole, and he has been sentenced, once, for escaping from lawful custody. This record has resulted in him spending seven of the last ten years in gaol, and the present offence was committed within three months of his last release from custody on 21 November 2002. 
     
      
    15 The pre-sentence report and a report from a psychologist, Suzanne Freeman, indicated that the applicant had been the only child of his mother’s first marriage, which had ended when he was aged about two years, and that he had thereafter suffered violence from his step father. In 1987, he was declared uncontrollable, and made a State ward. From that time he spent various periods living with house parents, or in care or juvenile detention institutions, where his behavioural problems escalated. He claimed to have been sexually assaulted by a youth worker at one such institution.  
     
      
    16 His education in the mainstream system ceased at the age of 12 years, and his literacy and employment prospects were impaired by that circumstance. His employment has apparently been confined to a short period during 2002 when he worked in a tattooing parlour, using his artistic talents.  
     
      
    17 He had a long history of multi drug abuse, including heroin, benzodiazepines, amphetamines and cocaine, and also alcohol, commencing at the age of 14 years, although he claimed not to have used while in custody. He had been introduced to drugs by a prostitute, and had worked in that capacity himself, at the Wall, for about 2 years.  
     
      
    18 The records show that he had been prone to depression, and to feelings of paranoia, and had lost contact with his family for an extended period prior to his most recent arrest. There was a history of non-compliance with parole conditions and of an absence of co-operation with the Parole Service.  
     
      
    19 His intelligence was assessed as falling within the average range. There was no suggestion of him suffering from any form of ongoing psychiatric disorder which might have adversely affected his prospects of rehabilitation, although clearly his psychological development had been adversely affected by his very disturbed childhood and adolescent experiences, and by the deep emotional problems associated therewith, the existence of which he frankly acknowledged in a letter which he had prepared for the sentencing proceedings.  
     
      
    20 The evidence revealed that, in more recent times, he had re-established a relationship with his mother, an aunt and his grandmother, that he had resumed attempts at gaining an education, and had taken a particular interest in reading and painting. He had proved to be a promising artist, who had won a NSW Prison Fellowship art prize, and whose work had been exhibited in Canada.  
     
      
    21 There was evidence from the applicant, as well as from a Prison Chaplain, and the psychologist, to show that he had decided to change his prior pattern of serious offending. In this regard, he disclosed a realisation that unless he changed his ways, he faced the possibility of spending the remainder of his life in prison. The discovery of his artistic talents had encouraged him to consider a future as a graphic designer.  
     
      
    22 Additionally there was material to suggest that he had come to realise the futility of drug abuse, and to appreciate that he needed assistance to break his former cycle of drug addiction. To that end, arrangements had been put in train for his future admission to the Odyssey House Programme. While in custody he had been in contact with a drug and alcohol counsellor. 
     
      
    23 The Chaplain was sufficiently impressed by his apparent change in attitude, to provide a positive reference for him and to indicate that he would remain in contact after his release to assist with his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    24 In his evidence and letter to the court, the applicant expressed feelings of remorse, as he had in his consultation with Miss Freeman. He disclosed that he had chosen to remain on protection, even though that involved him being locked in his cell for all but one hour per day, in order to avoid contact with other inmates who “only want to talk jail talk”, and because of the fears which he held for his own safety. In that regard it is the case that he had initially been placed on protection after a fight during an earlier period of imprisonment, with a number of other inmates, over some drug issues.  
     
      
    25 The fact that the applicant had taken steps himself to trace his family through the Salvation Army Family Tracing Service, was itself a positive indication that he was seriously contemplating a change in his ways, and it also provided him with the possibility of a future support network on the outside.  
     
      
    26 His Honour accepted that the applicant had expressed a determination to reform and to rehabilitate himself and that his expression of remorse was genuine. He found that there were “reasons to believe in [his] case that [he] had good prospects of rehabilitation”. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – The difference in the penalty imposed on the co-offender gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant 
       
      
    27 The relevant principle is that set forth in the well known decisions of Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 98 A Crim R 134 at 301 and it does not require repetition, for the purpose of determining this application, other than to note that, for the Court to intervene, it must be satisfied that the difference in sentences between co-offenders, after making sufficient allowance for any differences in their objective and subjective circumstances, would leave the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    28 It is to be noted that, when sentencing the applicant, his Honour found that the s 113(2) offence fell “towards the upper end of [the] scale of seriousness”. When sentencing Mancic, his Honour described the offence as falling “towards the upper end of the mid-range for such offences”. While the difference in categorisation was not explained, it may be that his Honour took into account the dangerous conduct of the applicant as the driver, both while ramming the Subaru into the service station door, and while endeavouring to ensure the escape of Mancic and himself.  
     
      
    29 It was a serious offence of its kind that called for significant weight to be given to the elements of punishment, retribution and deterrence, both specific and general, in the case of each offender. However, in the case of the joint enterprise that was here involved, it is difficult to see why their complicity or objective criminality should not have been regarded as equivalent, particularly as it was Mancic who damaged the protective barrier to the cigarette display, and whose role it clearly had been to steal the property contained therein, which had been the purpose of the ram-raid. 
     
      
    30 There were differences of significance between the two offenders. In favour of the applicant, he was held to have been entitled to a 5% greater discount for the plea, which in his case had been offered earlier. Additionally there was a finding of special circumstances in his case, but not in the case of Mancic. That circumstance explained the numerical similarity in their non-parole periods, but it did not explain the apparent difference in starting points which in the case of the applicant was 7 years, and in the case of Mancic 3 years and 9 months. 
     
      
    31 The remaining circumstances certainly did operate against the applicant, in so far as he had a much worse criminal history than Mancic, who had not previously served any custodial sentence. That offender was aged 25 years at the time of the offence, and had a record that was confined to two offences of break enter and steal, as well as offences of larceny, possess housebreaking implements and assault, each of which had been dealt with by way of a bond.  
     
      
    32 It is well established that the difference between the criminal histories of offenders, and their prior custodial experiences, is a circumstance that may properly justify a difference in sentencing outcomes. As was said in Postiglione at p 303: 
     
      
       
        
        “as between co-offenders, different criminal histories and custodial patterns may be such as to justify a real difference in the time each will serve in prison. And, of course, it is necessary when applying the parity principle that like be compared with like. There may be some aspect of one offender's criminal history or custodial situation which has no counterpart in the case of his or her co-accused. If so, it may justify the imposition of a different sentence or the structuring of the sentence in such a way that it results in some difference in the period actually spent in custody.” 
        
       
      
    33 It is the case that while periodic detention is not an entirely soft option, it is nevertheless considerably less arduous than full time custody, since it only requires detention for part of the week and converts to community service before its completion: see R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 and R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405 at para 32. In the instant case, Mancic was eligible for periodic detention, but the applicant was barred from eligibility because of his prior record (s 65A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). Mancic received the maximum total sentence available for that form of detention, and as I have observed, his non-parole period was maintained at the statutory proportion.  
     
      
    34 It is evident from the reasons for sentence in Mancic’s case, that his prior offences, and breach of a bond, were not entirely minimised, in so far as his Honour observed that the prior break enter and steal matters, in particular, did not give him any assistance, and resulted in the court not being able to extend to him any particular leniency. 
     
      
    35 What was persuasive in not imposing a sentence of full time custody, it seems, was the positive evidence that was available which led his Honour to conclude that, in his case, there was “some hope of genuine rehabilitation” and that he had not become “totally inured to a life of crime.” 
     
      
    36 In that regard, there was an expert opinion before the court from Dr Roberts, which contained some analysis of the offender’s background. He had been born in Australia and came from a family with a Serbian background. His mother had left the family when he was aged seven years and his father had died when he was about 12 years old. He had then remained in the care of his grandparents, who had been unable to adjust to their son’s death, and this led to difficulties in the co-offender’s relationship with them. 
     
      
    37 Dr Roberts expressed the view that he had developed unresolved psychological issues in relation to grief, the rejection of his mother, and the suicide of a long term friend, which had led to depression, and a slide into substance abuse and criminal activity. The pre-sentence report was noted as “positive”, in so far as it suggested that the co-offender had come to understand the need for him to seek ongoing counselling, and had expressed a willingness to address the matters which had led to his drift into offending behaviour.  
     
      
    38 The difference in sentences was explained by his Honour as referable to the present applicant’s criminal history which was described as “much worse” than that of the co-offender. His Honour said, when sentencing Mancic:  
     
      
       
        
        “I have come to the conclusion that bearing in mind your relatively short criminal history and the genuine prospects of rehabilitation, the appropriate penalty in this case, particularly as it will be your first custodial sentence, is a sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention.” 
        
       
      
    39 In circumstances where there were such marked differences in the criminal histories of the two offenders, and where one offender, the applicant, had in the past displayed a defiance of the criminal law, and an unpreparedness to respect the constraints of parole, and where the other offender was facing a first time of imprisonment, there clearly was a proper basis for the imposition of a heavier sentence upon the applicant. As this Court made clear in R v Lovelock (1988) 19 ALR 327, differences in sentences are justified by differences in antecedents alone.  
     
      
    40 The fact that the applicant had two offences taken into account on a Form 1 that had not been taken into account in relation to the co-offender, was a further ground for differentiation.  
     
      
    41 The question which arises however, is whether the extent of differentiation was so significant as to leave the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    42 In my view this question should be answered in the affirmative. It would appear that his Honour fell into error in his assessment of the culpability of the two offenders, in so far as he categorised the subject offence at a different level of seriousness in the separate reasons for sentence. Additionally the difference between the head sentences and the circumstances in which they were to be served seems to me to have been disproportionate to the differences in their objective and subjective circumstances.  
     
      
    43 I would accordingly grant leave to appeal 
     
      
       
       
      Ground 2 – The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    44 It was also submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive, being within the top 13% of the statistical population comprised by all offenders sentenced for that particular offence and that it was towards the top of the range for a s 113(2) offence that was dealt with by way of a plea. Error was additionally asserted in his Honour’s failure to specifically refer to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, or to the factors discussed in the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435. 
     
      
    45 It is true that his Honour did not make express reference to the provisions of s 21A. However, so far as I can see, there were no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, mentioned in the Section, which were not dealt with in the reasons for sentence. Moreover it is the case that, in the course of the submissions, there was express reference to the provision, and it is therefore evident that it was not overlooked. 
     
      
    46 It is important that Judges do not merely pay lip service to s 21A. It is an essential part of the fact finding exercise for sentencing purposes, and a failure to deal with it will generally provide reasons for the Court, at least, to grant leave to appeal, that is, unless it otherwise appears that each of the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors has been otherwise addressed.  
     
      
    47 The sentencing statistics are of limited assistance in this case given the small population, and the fact that the offence includes a variety of cases, and is not confined to ram-raid offences of the kind involved in this case, which must be regarded as a particularly serious form of offending within the reach of the section. Additionally it is not to be overlooked that the comparison with the statistics is complicated where Form 1 offences have been taken into account, since that will require some increase in the sentence, for the reasons discussed in The Attorney General’s Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518. The extent of the increase will vary according to the number and nature of the offences included in the Form 1.  
     
      
    48 I am not persuaded, subject to one consideration, that much assistance was to be gained by the reference which it was suggested should have been made to the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. That decision was confined to the identification of the relevant sentencing considerations for s 112 and related offences, and it did not establish a starting point or develop a range of appropriate sentences. It was a case that identified eleven factors which are to be taken as reflecting the seriousness of the offence, and as justifying an increase in the quantum of sentence, if present, particularly if more than one is present.  
     
      
    49 In the present case, there were four relevant factors present, namely that the offence was the result of planning and organisation, the applicant had a prior history for like offences, the offence was accompanied by significant damage to property, and force was used.  
     
      
    50 More relevantly however, as Grove J said in Ponfield, with the concurrence of Spigelman CJ and Sully J: 
     
      
       
        
        “49. It will of course be requisite for a sentencing court to give appropriate weight to matters in mitigation as manifest in the particular case. These will include evidence of genuine regret and remorse and any rehabilitative steps taken by the offender. Whilst addiction to drugs and alcohol is a relevant circumstance for the Court to consider it is not of itself a mitigating factor. (See  
        R v Henry 
         supra at pars [193] - [203] and [217] to [259]).” 
        
       
       
      
    51 The matter which seems not to have been sufficiently addressed by his Honour, which may also have led to the disparity is that insufficient regard was given to the principles which relate to offenders who are seen to be “at the crossroads”, and for whom a leniency to which they would not otherwise be entitled, should be extended so as to encourage their reform: see R v Osenkowski (1982) 5 A Crim R 394 and R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at para 293; that is subject always to the court subjecting cases of this kind to careful analysis, and not resorting to wishful thinking (per Dunford J in R v Govinder (1999) 106 A Crim R 314), or to “triumph of hope over experience” (per Spigelman CJ in R v Hunt [2002] NSWCCA 482 at para 30). 
     
      
    52 I have given very careful consideration to this aspect of the case, as there was room for optimism that the applicant had truly reached the crossroads, and an acceptable basis for recognising that his attempts at rehabilitation were genuine and considerable.  
     
      
    53 As a consequence, I am of the view that there should be some reduction in the head sentence, and also in the non-parole period. As presently framed the sentence provides for a significant gap between these two aspects of the sentencing order, which does not necessarily enure to the benefit of the applicant, since there is no guarantee of his release upon expiry of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    54 Since the cross roads factor has weighed significantly in my assessment of an appropriate head sentence, in addition to the parity factor, I do consider it appropriate to maintain approximately the same proportion between it and the non-parole period, which was reflected in the original sentencing order. A slight increase in the overall proportion is however necessary to allow for the accumulation for the offences dealt with in the Blacktown Local Court.  
     
      
    55 The finding of special circumstances should be maintained to allow for a sufficient period of supervised release, in order to foster the rehabilitation prospects which have been demonstrated.  
     
      
    56 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted; 
       
       
      2. Sentence below quashed, and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months, commencing on 18 February 2003, and expiring on 17 November 2006. 
       
       
      3. Non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months fixed, to commence on 18 February 2003 and to expire on 17 December 2004. 
       
       
      4. Vary the commencement date of the sentences imposed in the Blacktown Local Court on 16 December 2003, each being sentences for fixed terms of 4 months, in so far as they are now to commence on 18 December 2004 and to expire on 17 April 2005.

      70065/03 REGINA v ROBERT CRAIG GOODWIN 
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  On 16 June 2004 the offender, Robert Goodwin, pleaded guilty to an indictment containing two counts of murder. Both offences were committed on or about 28 February 2003 in Cooma. The victims were the offender’s estranged wife, Carolyn Goodwin and her then partner, Peter Clarke, who was incidentally the Sheriff in Cooma. The offender shot them both dead at Mr Clarke’s premises where the offender’s wife was then residing. 
     
      
    2 Mr Goodwin was committed to this Court for trial, but shortly before the hearing was to commence a question arose as to the offender’s fitness to stand trial. The basis for this issue was the offender’s apparent inability to remember the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing. After a short hearing at which Dr Westmore gave evidence, on 15 June 2003 I found the offender fit to be tried. The following day the offender pleaded guilty to the two charges. 
     
      
    3 The facts can be stated very briefly and are not in dispute. The Crown tendered what I was told was an agreed statement of facts together with a number of statements and photographs from the police brief. I raised with counsel whether I was to use the witness statements as the basis of the finding of facts upon which the offender was to be sentenced or the statement of facts. I was told that the statement of facts was only a summary and that it was to be amplified by the material in the brief of evidence. I made it plain that I considered it was open for me, therefore, to find facts in accordance with the witness statements and neither counsel demurred to that proposition. 
     
      
    4 The offender and his wife had been married some 34 years at the time of the killing. There are two sons of the marriage, Shane Goodwin, aged 34, and Dean Goodwin, aged 19. The elder brother was at the relevant time working in the Northern Territory and the younger was residing with his father in the matrimonial home in Cooma. 
     
      
    5 Sometime prior to 14 February 2003, the offender’s wife and Mr Clarke commenced a relationship. On that date Ms Goodwin moved out of the matrimonial home to live with Mr Clarke. They intended to relocate from Cooma to Jindabyne in the first weekend in March. 
     
      
    6 Just after his wife left him, Mr Goodwin spoke to his younger son, Dean, and expressed his intention to shoot his wife and Mr Clarke and then take his own life. He expressed a similar intention to his elder son, Shane, on or about the 25th or 26th of February. 
     
      
    7 On 26 February Ms Goodwin’s solicitor sent a letter to the offender indicating that she would be seeking a divorce. 
     
      
    8 In the days leading up to the killings the offender was seen in Bent Street, Cooma, the street in which Mr Clarke resided. 
     
      
    9 On 28 February at about 10pm a resident of Bent Street heard what he thought to be two gunshots. In the early hours of the next day, 1 March, the offender rang his son Dean, told him that he loved him and gave him information as to accessing the superannuation fund held by the offender and his wife. He also told him where he could find his will. When asked whether he was coming home, he told his son that he had been drinking and had a bit of an accident. The offender informed him that Dean would have to make arrangements for collecting the family vehicles and told him where they could be located. 
     
      
    10 At about 4.55am that morning the offender attended Cooma Hospital suffering from a wound to the forehead and explained to hospital staff that he had fallen over. The wound was sutured and the offender discharged. He then travelled by taxi to his home, where he spoke to Dean. The offender initially told him that he had been drunk and had fallen over, but later when they were alone he confessed that he had shot his wife and Peter Clarke. He described the wounded Mr Clarke crawling on the ground while the offender kicked him in the ribs so hard that he believed he might have broken them. 
     
      
    11 Dean immediately went to the Clarke residence in Bent Street where he found the bodies of the two deceased. Peter Clarke was lying in the hallway and his mother in a bedroom. After determining that his mother was in fact dead, he left the premises, informing the taxi driver of what he had found. He then proceeded to recover one of the family vehicles and drove home. After arming himself with a knife, he confronted the offender. Shortly thereafter and without incident he left the house and went to a police station where he gave an account of what had occurred. 
     
      
    12 The offender was arrested at the family home later that afternoon. He was taken to hospital for further treatment to his forehead. He maintained that the injury had occurred when he had fallen over and denied knowledge of the death of Mr Clarke or his wife. He also denied having access to a firearm. An X ray of the offender’s skull revealed metal fragments and he was taken to Canberra Hospital. There he underwent an operation for the removal of the fragments that were found to be the result of a gunshot wound to the head. 
     
      
    13 Police searching in the vicinity of Cooma Hospital, where a person carrying a rifle had been seen on the night of the killing, recovered a bloodstained .22 rifle. They also found blood in the area where the rifle was located and a trail of blood leading back to the hospital car park. An examination of the premises in Bent Street found blood splatters consistent with the two deceased being shot where their bodies were located. There was evidence linking the deceased with a bloody hand mark on a doorknob. Further investigations produced an overwhelming case linking the offender with the killings. 
     
      
    14 Peter Clarke sustained a single gunshot wound to the head, the path of the bullet being from front to back and slightly upwards. Ms Goodwin sustained four gunshot wounds to the face. The bullet paths were all front to back and downwards. One wound showed an injury consistent with the shot having been fired in close contact with the skin. The bullets recovered were found to have been fired from the .22 rifle earlier recovered by police. 
     
      
    15 The evidence was that a similar firearm had been owned by the offender for very many years and at one stage had been stored under the family house in two pieces. It had a broken bolt when last seen by Shane Goodwin.  
     
      
    16 After his arrest, the offender refused to be interviewed by police and he did not give evidence before me. On the sentencing hearing a psychological report was tendered that contains an account of the killings given by the offender to the psychologist on 13 July 2004. This is notwithstanding that the offender had earlier claimed to psychiatrists that he had no recollection of the events leading up to the shooting of his wife and Mr Clarke. This asserted lack of memory for the events was the basis for Dr Westmore’s belief that the offender was unfit to be tried. The fitness proceedings before me were conducted on the assumption that the offender had no memory of the events as at the date of the hearing, that is 15 June. Yet by 13 July the offender was able to give a very full account of the shootings to a psychologist even to the extent of repeating statements allegedly made by his wife and Mr Clarke just before he shot them both. 
     
      
    17 It has been held that a sentencing court should not readily accept accounts by offenders of the circumstances giving rise to the commission of an offence when those accounts are contained in reports tendered to the court without sworn evidence by the offender to substantiate them or in the absence of some other reliable objective evidence that might tend to indicate that the account is true. In the present case there are some aspects of the offender’s account of his relationship with his wife and the events leading up to the killing that are supported by evidence contained in the Crown brief and that I would be prepared to act upon. 
     
      
    18 For example the account of his relationship with his wife is supported substantially by what Shane Goodwin said about that matter in his statement to police. It seems that about 15 years before the killing the offender’s wife had left him to live with another man. This resulted in the selling of what was then the family home. At that time, according to Shane, his father had made some vague threat about obtaining a weapon and shooting dead his wife. Shane believed that this threat was out of character and made at a time when his father was physically and mentally ill as a result of the separation. About 12 months later, the offender and his wife were reunited and the family house in Cooma was then purchased. 
     
      
    19 I am also prepared to accept that the offender was devastated when his wife left him to live with Mr Clarke and had been totally unsuspecting of the fact that his wife had been having a relationship with another man. This event was as much a shock to the two sons as it was to the offender. He was clearly in a highly distressed and disturbed state as a result of the separation. Dean told the police that his father could not sleep or eat. Although he was making threats toward his wife and Mr Clarke, Shane was more concerned that his father might injure himself because of his emotionally disturbed state. 
     
      
    20 I am not prepared, however, to act upon the account given by the offender of the immediate circumstances giving rise to the killing contained in the psychological report. That version suggests that he was provoked into the shooting of his wife by her verbal abuse of his family and her statement that she wished that he were dead and that she had killed him herself. I am also not willing to accept his account that he found the rifle in the family utility with a box of bullets after his wife had told him during the course of their argument at Mr Clarke’s house that some person had placed a weapon there. Nor do I accept his account of taking the rifle to the house so that his wife could kill him as she had said she wished to do or that he shot Mr Clarke because he came towards him in a threatening and aggressive manner. 
     
      
    21 The offender told the psychologist that he did not remember much of the shooting of his wife but he remembered the conversation. He maintained that he was amnesic to many of the circumstances of the shooting, and did not remember why for example he returned to the house or why he did not simply shoot himself when he found the weapon. The answer seems to me to be obvious, and is found in the threats he had made to both his sons that he would kill his wife or his wife and Mr Clarke, and then commit suicide. There is no doubt that he acted out of depression, frustration and anger at his wife’s actions. But it has to be borne in mind that the behaviour that led to these feelings and her death was merely the wife deciding to exercise her right to end the marriage and enter into a new relationship. It should be clear by now that I believe that the offender went to Mr Clarke’s premises for no reason other than to kill his wife and probably Mr Clarke if he found him there. 
     
      
    22 The offender wrote a letter to the Court that was tendered in evidence and read aloud by me to those present at the time. It contains expressions of remorse at the killings and a desire to apologise to members of Mr Clarke’s and his wife’s families. I place little weight upon it. The psychological report does not refer to any expression of remorse and it repeats the offender’s recriminations against his wife for her misconduct toward him including her extravagance and selfishness, her abuse of alcohol, and her violence towards the offender. He blames her for provoking him, not simply by leaving the marriage, but in slandering the family and expressing the wish that he were dead. 
     
      
    23 I strongly suspect that the offender initially feigned his lack of memory of the events of the shooting when it seemed to him that it might be to his advantage to do so. When he was found fit to be tried, he then gave an account to the psychologist designed to justify his actions if he could and limit the blame to be attributed to him. He would not be punished for this conduct even if I were satisfied that this what happened. But it supports my view that he is not genuinely remorseful for the death of his wife and the hapless Mr Clarke. Further, when during a conversation with Shane his son expressed his difficulty in comprehending that he had shot his wife, the offender said, “But look what the bitch was gunna do to me”. Shane did not believe that his father was remorseful at that time, and he was in my view correct in that assessment. Although the offender has expressed some regret to his brother-in-law, I doubt that it was sincere or, if it was, that it was any more than a regret about the penal consequences of his actions. 
     
      
    24 I do not believe that the attempt at suicide was, as defence counsel submitted, an acceptance of the enormity or wrongfulness of his actions. It is relevant, however. in that it shows the level of his emotional disturbance at the time and is an indication of the depth of his despair arising from his wife leaving him. 
     
      
    25 Still he has pleaded guilty albeit at a late stage in the proceedings and he is to receive a benefit for that fact. Although I do not believe that the plea signifies remorse, the utilitarian effect of the plea was significant notwithstanding that it came shortly before the trial was to commence. It did save valuable court time and, perhaps more significantly, spared witnesses from giving evidence, particularly the two sons for whom it would have been a very traumatic experience. It was also an expression of his acceptance of responsibility for the killings. I believe this was a highly significant event for his sons. I noted in particular that the younger burst into tears when his father pleaded guilty before me. For these reasons the plea was important and I am prepared to give him a greater discount than might otherwise have been the case. 
     
      
    26 Mr Goodwin is aged 57. Despite some criminal record I am prepared to treat him as a person of prior good character. There is little in his background or personal history that seems to me to be relevant to the task of sentencing him for these crimes. He was undoubtedly a hard-working, and well-respected member of the community. He appeared to be a loving and caring father and there is no suggestion of physical abuse of his children. Any violence involving his wife was not serious and can be disregarded. 
     
      
    27 This particular offence is aggravated because there was an element of planning over a few days prior to the killing, and, as I have already indicated, I believe that he went to the house intending to kill his wife. The fact that he killed two persons must increase his criminality even though the killings arose from a single incident of violence and were both a result of the same emotional turmoil in which he found himself after his wife left him. I accept, however, that his culpability was however diminished by his abnormal mental state at the time as a result of anxiety and depression caused by his wife’s separation from him. 
     
      
    28 I do not accept, however, that the acts were provoked to the degree that it can be a mitigating factor in a case of a premeditated killing. Once it is accepted that his wife’s act in leaving him resulted in a disordered mental state in which he considered taking his own life as well as that of his wife, there seems to me to be little or no other relevance in the fact that the killings occurred as a result of her conduct. I accept that he is a person of good character as well as having no significant criminal convictions. It is unlikely that he will re-offend simply because of his age and the fact that he must spend a very lengthy period in custody so that there will be in a practical sense little remaining opportunity for him to form a relationship with another person such as he enjoyed with his wife. 
     
      
    29 There is nothing in his current physical or mental state that can impact upon the sentence to be imposed upon him, given the nature and seriousness of the offences he committed. The Crown has quite properly and fairly, in my view, conceded that by reason of his mental state at the time of the killing a life sentence is not appropriate. I agree with that concession. The sentence, however, must be a lengthy one for reasons of retribution, denunciation and general deterrence. I do not believe that his mental state significantly reduces the need for the sentence to make it clear that persons cannot react to life crises, however great they may be, by the use of violence to others as a way of obtaining revenge, seeking retribution or preventing that person’s future enjoyment of life. 
     
      
    30 There have been placed before the Court two victim impact statements. The first was that from Shane Goodwin and was read by him aloud. I noted that during the course of it his father was occasionally brought to tears. It was no doubt beneficial to Shane, and perhaps even his father, to have the impact upon him of the death of his mother occasioned by his father, spoken aloud in his father’s presence. It was a very moving, eloquent and yet restrained recitation of the effect of the killing upon every aspect of his son’s life. There was also a statement tendered from the former wife of Mr Clarke. The court received neither of these statements in order to increase the seriousness of the crimes committed by the offender or the punishment to be imposed upon him. 
     
      
    31 I was referred to a number of sentences imposed by this Court for other cases of multiple murders but they are in my view of limited value. I reviewed some of them when I sentenced the offender Fraser for the murder of his three children. The range presented is very wide indeed as would be expected having regard to the variety of facts and circumstances that the sentences reflect. 
     
      
    32 Although the standard non-parole period specified under the Table to s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not apply because the offender pleaded guilty, it is not irrelevant as a guide or an indication of the way Parliament regards the offence of murder and how it should be punished; R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 at [122]. The standard non-parole period for an offence of murder, that is an offence falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, is imprisonment for 20 years. In my view each offence taken in isolation is one that would have fallen within that range if sentence had been imposed after a trial. Although the offence was aggravated by the fact that it was premeditated and, committed in the home of Mr Clarke where both deceased were then residing, the offender, who was of otherwise good character, was suffering from a significant mental and emotional disturbance which affected his reasoning. He is, however, entitled to a discount of 17.5 per cent for the plea of guilty.  
     
      
    33 There should be some accumulation in order to arrive at an appropriate total minimum term that represents the totality of the criminality in taking the two lives in the way that he did. There should in my view be a total undiscounted sentence of 33 years with a non-parole period of 26 years. Doing the best I can to apply the discounts and structure the sentence appropriately I believe that the non-parole period, therefore, in each case would be one of imprisonment for 16½ years. An appropriate total minimum period of custody in this case is nothing less than 21½ years. Although the relationship between the total term and the overall non-parole period is slightly more than provided by s 44 of the Act it is an appropriate one in my view in this particular case. The sentences are to date from 1 March 2003. 
     
      
    34 In respect of the murder of his wife the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16½ years to date from 1 March 2003 and to expire on 31 August 2019. The balance of the term is 5½ years from 1 September 2019. In respect of the murder of Mr Clarke the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16½ years to date from 1 March 2008 and to expire on 31 August 2024 the date upon which the offender is to be considered for release to parole. The balance of the term is 5½ years from 31 August 2024 and will expire on 28 February 2030.

     Regina v Phillip George 
    The applicant was found guilty of manslaughter by criminal negligence on 28 November 2002 arising from his gross and wilful failure to provide his elderly mother, for whom he was primary carer, with proper nutrition, hydration, medication and medical care. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. The sentence imposed was a term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. Ground 1: The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to give any, or any adequate, weight to the evidence of the applicant’s psychological conditionIt was held that insufficient weight was given to evidence before the court to the effect that the applicant was suffering from Asperger’s Syndrome and/or other psychological problems resulting from a solitary life and social dysfunction. Legal principle highlights the relevance of a mental disorder or abnormality in assessing the extent of an offender’s objective criminality and determining the weight to be accorded to issues of general and personal deterrence: Regina v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. While the evidence did not suggest the applicant suffered a severe psychiatric or personality disorder, it showed that his capacity to respond to his responsibilities was impaired. Leave to appeal is granted in order for the Court to make its own assessment of the materials.Ground 2: The sentence is manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances and a less severe sentence is warranted and ought to be imposedThe circumstances by which the Court as a court of review can intervene in an appeal against sentence are found in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. This case was one where the personal circumstances of the applicant were wholly exceptional. The practice of approaching sentencing appeals through comparison with other cases is unhelpful and not justified by authority: Regina v Morgan (1993) 70 Crim R 368; Regina v Salameh NSWCCA 9 June 1994; and Regina v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43 per Barr J at 98 to 101. Issues of objective and subjective culpability differ from case to case and judicial discretion is required in the individual sentencing process. The sentence was manifestly excessive based on the particular facts of the case.Orders:1. Leave to appeal granted;2. Appeal allowed, sentence below quashed, and in lieu thereof Applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months, to date from 28 November 2002, and to expire on 27 May 2006;3.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 28 November 2002, the Applicant was found guilty by his Honour Judge Bellear after a judge alone trial, in the District Court, of the manslaughter of his 86 year old mother, Joyce May George. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. The case was one of manslaughter by criminal negligence, arising from the gross and wilful failure of the Applicant, as the primary carer of his mother, to provide her with proper nutrition, hydration, medication and medical care.  
     
      
    2 The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 The objective facts as found by his Honour are compendiously recorded in the reasons for conviction, and also in the reasons for sentence. No issue is taken with them. In brief summary, it was the case that the Applicant resided at Windsor with his mother, and a sister who was developmentally disabled. He was, at the time of his mother’s death, aged 58 years. He had never been married, or had any long term relationship. For much of his life he had been unemployed, although in more recent times he had become involved in carrying out minor administrative activities for a chiropractic clinic.  
     
      
    4 The relationship between the Applicant and his brothers was somewhat antagonistic and their mother, as one of them said, “didn’t want this sort of atmosphere in the house, so we just, you know, didn’t take any further action after that”. The evidence was that the Applicant never tried to stop his family from coming to the house. In the result, the Applicant’s brothers made visits to the home that were somewhat irregular and that occurred only during his absence. During a period of hospitalisation in 1998 they were informed by their mother that they were not to arrange home care because she was embarrassed by the state of the house. There was evidence to the effect that the garden was seriously overgrown and unkempt, and that the interior was a mess with rubbish and papers, some of which were kept in bags, piled up in many rooms. The shower had not worked for some time and it appeared that the bath was not working either. Newspapers were stacked in the shower recess. The toilet leaked. Thick dust and cobwebs were evident throughout. 
     
      
    5 There was evidence from the Applicant’s family to show that the deceased had been a very domineering person, who had insisted upon having her own way, and who had not been accustomed to receiving, or tolerating, resistance from her husband or children. Her daughter in law said:  
     
      
       
        
        “You couldn’t go against mother. If she said something, you had to do it, otherwise it was too much of an upset to her and everybody else”. 
        
       
      
    6 There was also evidence to show that she had vigorously resisted all of the attempts that had been made to provide her with home care, or to take her to go to hospital where, for some reason, she had a particular aversion to being showered, describing it as “the most cruel thing on earth”.  
     
      
    7 At midday, on 20 April 2000, Central District Ambulance were called to the premises by the Applicant. When ambulance officers arrived they saw an elderly bedridden female in the front bedroom. When they approached her they noticed a putrid smell coming from the bedroom. Upon examination of the patient they saw that she was covered in “bed sores”, that she was wearing soiled clothing, and that her bed and person were covered in human vomitus, faeces, urine and body fluids, some of which were ingrained into her skin.  
     
      
    8 One officer said that when the Applicant met them at the house he said “she’s in on the bed whimpering like a dog” and added that “she’s past home care.” He also indicated that she had fallen 12 days previously.  
     
      
    9 In order to transport the victim to hospital, it was necessary for the ambulance officers to cut the bed sheets and underlay from around her, such was the extent and duration of the seepage of bodily fluids onto these items which were adhering to her body.  
     
      
    10 The open pressure sores which were present were particularly serious, one being deep enough to reveal the underlying hip and femur. Her skin was tenting, that being a symptom of severe dehydration. She weighed a mere 39 Kgs, a circumstance consistent with severe malnutrition. She was semi conscious and in such a poor condition that, despite hospital intervention, she died some 4 days later.  
     
      
    11 Dr Briggs, who summarised the treatment provided to the deceased, upon her admission to the Hawkesbury Hospital, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was felt that this 86 year old woman, who showed signs of severe neglect and malnutrition, may have had a treatable cause for her reduced level of consciousness, hypertension and hypothermia. Her dehydration, which was quite marked, and her hypercalcaemia were treated with intravenous fluids and she was given antibiotics in case there was a hidden infection which seemed likely. The cause of her hypercalcaemia was not clear.” 
        
       
      
    12 Dr Bogdan Hulewicz, who performed the post mortem examination, certified that the cause of death was bronchial pneumonia, the underlying causes being malnutrition and multiple decubitus ulcers on the trunk and lower limbs. He gave evidence that he would include the Proteus bacteria as an underlying cause of death, but added that at the time of the post mortem he had been unaware of the presence of that bacteria.  
     
      
    13 Associate Professor Stewart expressed the opinion that the deceased had suffered from impaired nutrition for approximately 60 days or perhaps longer. There was also medical opinion that she would have been non-responsive and close to being in a coma, for at least 5 to 7 days before the ambulance service was called.  
     
      
    14 At the time of her death, Mrs George was 86 years of age. She had been treated by Dr Warwick McKay between 6 March 1992 and 21 September 1998 for osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, chronic constipation, depression and mild dementia. She was admitted to hospital twice during 1998 and was assessed by Dr McKay as requiring constant ongoing medical care, of the kind that would have necessitated transport to medical facilities, or the provision of home visits. It was his account that her attendances for treatment were infrequent and that she had not been seen by him after 21 September 1998. So far as the evidence showed, no other medical practitioner saw her between this time and 20 April 2000.  
     
      
    15 As his Honour found, she was denied the opportunity of medical treatment, and had not been provided, from January 1996, with any of the medication which had been prescribed. She had not been given sufficient food or fluids, and she had been left in a state of appalling neglect in circumstances where neither her clothing, nor her bed linen were changed in any regular way. She had not been provided with a hygienic environment or with even the most basic of care. Clearly she had been allowed to suffer over a considerable period, although to a considerable extent that was due to her own refusal to receive external help, either at home, or in hospital. Her daughter gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you know that when the ambulance officers came, your mother was covered in faeces, poo? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, the reason for that is she wouldn’t let me touch her, she used to get very upset, she used to pull, she wouldn’t let me even pull the top sheet, she used to pull [it closed]…and [say] ‘Don’t touch me’ and every time I used to go in and empty the potty, she used to say, ‘I will fill it if you empty that’. She wouldn’t let me touch her because she knew that if I saw it I would have stuck her in a nursing home or in a hospital. But she didn’t want to leave me, she didn’t want to go there.” 
        
       
      
    16 For such time as she was a competent adult, she was entitled to refuse such treatment, and the culpability of the Applicant largely related to the period when she was unable to make rational decisions for herself, and in particular to the period immediately preceding her admission to hospital where she had been comatose or unconscious.  
     
      
    17 His Honour found, in convicting the Applicant, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mrs George was dehydrated and malnourished to such an extent that it limited her ability to fight infection and that the Proteus bacteria was able to penetrate Mrs George’s bloodstream through the urinary tract or via the decubitus ulcers becoming of greater significance. I am satisfied that Mrs George became dehydrated, malnourished, was frail and infirm and her ability to fight infection was due to the inactions and omissions of the offender.” 
        
       
      
    18 These inactions and omissions of the Applicant, in the care of his mother were found by his Honour to have been “grossly and wickedly negligent”, to the standard identified in Regina v Nicholls [1874] 13 Cox CC 75, and in Regina v Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB 354. The Applicant was assessed as having been “criminally responsible for those underlying causes which, caused, contributed to and accelerated her death.” His Honour stated that “objectively the offence is extremely serious”, and stated that the Applicant had been “extremely reckless” and “indifferent” towards the care and health of his mother, to whom he owed a duty of care.  
     
      
    19 The views which expressed by Wood CJ at CL in Regina v Wilkinson NSWSC 9 April 1998, concerning the heavy responsibility which rests upon carers of young children, to provide for their well being and to secure medical care when needed, in our view, apply equally to those who care for the elderly and infirm. An appeal from that sentence was dismissed (R v Wilkinson [1999] NSWCCA 248), and it supports the proposition that offences of this kind must generally be regarded as objectively serious. However, the extent of that criminality will very much depend upon the individual case.  
     
      
    20 Subjectively the Applicant’s circumstances can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) he was sixty years of age at the time of sentence; 
       
       
      (b) he was a single man who had lived his whole life at Windsor, with his mother and sister, apart from a brief period during which he was involved in a relationship with a woman for about twelve months.  
       
       
      (c) he had no criminal history, was of prior good character and faced his first custodial term; 
       
       
      (d) he had very few outside social contacts although recently he had become involved in the local church, where he was involved in maintenance work; 
       
       
      (e) he had left school after completing the intermediate certificate and had not secured paid work until recently; 
       
       
      (f) he had been assessed by Mr West on behalf of the office of Probation and Parole as an “intelligent and articulate man, although seemingly to be socially isolated…” 
       
      
    21 His Honour found that he had been “in complete denial concerning the pain and distress that his mother must have experienced over an extended period”, that he displayed “no remorse for his actions whatsoever, either in court or to the probation and parole officer or to the psychologist Ms Nancy Wallace”. He quoted the following from the pre-sentence report: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would appear that he does not appreciate the impact that his actions and lack of actions had on his elderly mother, which would appear to negate his early long term commitment to the (sic) welfare.” 
        
       
      
    22 There was evidence concerning his mental state from Dr Olav Nielssen and as well as from Ms Wallace, which tended to explain his lack of insight and apparent inability to show remorse.  
     
      
    23 Dr Nielssen offered the following opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr George may have a mild variant of an autistic disorder, which is characterised by a life long pattern of abnormal social interaction and communication and a restricted repertoire of activities and interests. The aspects of the history and examination that support the diagnosis include a family history of developmental disorder, his lack of social contact as a child, the lack of any kind of long term relationship and his peculiar affect and interest in railways. However, he has at least normal intelligence with normal language skills and a specified area of detailed knowledge, which would place him in the sub category of Autism known as Asperger’s Disorder. 
        
       
       
        
        A diagnostic criteria of Mr George’s condition is a lack of social or emotional reciprocity, which could partly explain his apparent lack of concern for his mother’s condition. The idiosyncratic thinking that is usually observed in the presence of Mr George’s disorder could also explain his rather literal interpretation of his mother’s instructions and his apparent lack of concern when interviewed about the events.  
        
       
       
        
        The usual course of autistic disorder is for a gradual improvement in social skills with age, which could account for Mr George’s capacity to form a business partnership and his ability to participate in business in later life. His level of impairment is not sufficient to warrant any kind of treatment. In any case, the treatment that is most effective is intensive behavioural therapy in childhood and early adult life, as well as treatment of associated disorders such as psychosis with medication” 
        
       
       
      
    24 When giving evidence, Dr Nielssen pointed to the presence of some, although not all, of the diagnostic criteria identified in DSM4 for Asperger’s Syndrome, but accepted that he had not made a firm diagnosis of the condition, because he had only seen the Applicant once, and did not have the necessary corroborative information for at least some of the diagnostic criteria.  
     
      
    25 He accepted that the Applicant’s disorder was “certainly at the milder end of the spectrum of disability”.  
     
      
    26 This syndrome, he said, was best known for particular interests and talent, which in the present case he saw as having been manifested in the Applicant’s focus upon all things to do with railways.  
     
      
    27 He also explained that the condition, if present, would lead to difficulties in relating to other people, in having a normal level of empathy, and to recognise the reaction of others to that lack of empathy. At a cognitive level, he explained, a person with the condition could recognise that another person was in pain or suffering, but might not have the same emotional response as a person who was free of the condition.  
     
      
    28 Ms Wallace stated in her report: 
     
      
       
        
        “With reference to Dr Neilssen’s diagnosis of Autism or Asperger’s syndrome, I could find no convincing evidence of any symptomatology consistent with either, although there are certain indicators that make such diagnosis suspect, including [Mr George’s] obsession with trains.” 
        
       
      
    29 She also said that symptoms of a mood disorder which she considered more closely related to dysthymic disorder than any other mood disorder described in DSM4 were prominent in the Applicant’s clinical picture. Those problems, she suggested, were to be seen as the result of his life long poverty in relation to social contact. She also made reference to the possibility that he had been conditioned to obey his mother’s wishes from a very early age.  
     
      
    30 It was her conclusion that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr George’s own psychopathology, presumably arising from his psychological development in what sounds like a highly dysfunctional family, possibly complicated by some variant of autism have led to this tragic outcome.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    31 Although in the reasons for sentence his Honour did not expressly refer to the opinions of Dr Nielssen and Ms Wallace concerning the Applicant’s mental state, he found that the Applicant did not suffer from an impaired intellect, and went on to observe “nor do I regard him as having suffered from any serious psychiatric or personality disorder”. It is this finding that is at the heart of the present application. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The learned sentencing Judge erred in failing to give any, or any adequate, weight to the evidence of the Applicant’s psychological condition 
       
      
    32 Essentially this ground relates to a submission that his Honour failed to give proper regard to such evidence as was before the Court, concerning the possible presence, in the Applicant, of Asperger’s Syndrome, and/or concerning the psychological problems which he had, resulting from the solitary and socially dysfunctional life which he and his close family had shared. This material was relevant not only to the extent of the Applicant’s culpability but also went some distance in explaining the Applicant’s apparent lack of remorse, a matter upon which his Honour placed considerable emphasis. 
     
      
    33 It was also submitted that his Honour may also have given undue weight to the various references in the evidence to the Applicant being regarded as intelligent and articulate, since such skills are not necessarily compromised in persons suffering from the condition of Autism or the Asperger variant.  
     
      
    34 It is the case that the presence of a mental disorder, or abnormality, is of relevance, both for an assessment of the extent of an offender’s objective criminality, and for a determination as to whether or not the case is one that calls for a particular measure of deterrence. The principles are well known, and it is sufficient to continue any reference to the passages in two decisions, which are frequently cited in this context.  
     
      
    35 First, in Regina v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “21. The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercised has long been accepted. The relevant authorities have been reviewed in this Court, the Victorian Court of Appeal and the Western Australian Full Court. See  
        R v Fahda 
         [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48] per Simpson J;  
        R v Harb 
         [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45] per Smart AJ; see also  
        R v Lauritsen 
         (2000) 114 A Crim R 333, esp [43]-[51] per Malcolm CJ;  
        R v Tsiaras 
         [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; see also Potas,  
        Sentencing Manual: Law Principles and Practice in New South Wales 2001 
         at 285-286; Fox and Freiberg, 
         Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria 
         (2nd ed), 1999 at 293-294. 
         
         
        22. In the present case, the Crown was prepared to concede that some mitigation was appropriate, on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
        
       
       
        
        23. To the extent that mental illness explains the offence – as her Honour found to be the position in the present case – then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law.” 
         
         
        
       
      
    36 Secondly, as Wood CJ at CL explained in Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 376 (para 254), the reason for the adoption of the principle which was stated in R v Letteri NSWCCA 18 March 1993, and adopted in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, to the effect that less weight should be given to general deterrence in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality: 
     
      
       
        
        “lies in the circumstance that the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing. Moreover, such a condition is inherent and its presence does not depend upon any element of choice.” 
        
       
      
    37 Where such a condition is present, it is recognised that the offender is not an appropriate medium by which to make an example to others.  
     
      
    38 Similar considerations apply in relation to personal deterrence where the disability is such that the offender may not fully appreciate or understand the nature of his or her offending, or of the message which the sentence is expected to convey.  
     
      
    39 Additional reference may be made in these respects to Regina v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 and Regina v Anderson [1981] VR 155 at 160/161.  
     
      
    40 One might have expected that his Honour would have expressly dealt with the opinions of Dr Nielssen and Ms Wallace in his reasons for sentence, and explained why it was that he made the findings mentioned. That he did not do so was a deficiency of some importance. It was such that, consistently with the view which Wood CJ at CL expressed in Regina v Nelson [2002] NSWCCA 463, leave should be granted, so that this court can make its own assessment of that material.  
     
      
    41 While we are not persuaded the evidence would support a finding that the Applicant suffered from a serious psychiatric or personality disorder, there was sufficient, in our view, to warrant a finding that his objective criminality was reduced beyond that which a bare analysis of the neglected state of the deceased would, at first blush, suggest.  
     
      
    42 In this regard it is clear that he had not lived a normal life, having been socially isolated and having been under the control of a dominant mother. He had been left with the responsibility of her care, albeit with the assistance of a sister who had her own problems.  
     
      
    43 Upon the evidence his capacity to respond to his responsibilities was clearly impaired by an unusual personality disorder arising from his history of social dysfunction, as evidenced by the utterly bizarre circumstances in which he, and the immediate family, lived. 
     
      
    44 The case is a tragic and wholly exceptional one, and we are driven to the conclusion that the Applicant’s objective criminality was overstated by his Honour. As Dr Nielssen explained, Asperger’s Syndrome is not normally associated with criminal offending, and the risk of the Applicant reoffending, or of being placed in a similar situation, is minimal. Personal deterrence is, accordingly, of little relevance.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentence is manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances and a less severe sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed. 
       
      
    45 This ground properly reflects the circumstances in which this Court, as a court of review, can intervene on an appeal against sentence, in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    46 As has been recognised, and repeatedly stated, the circumstances which can give rise to the offence of manslaughter are so various, and the range of culpability so wide, that it is very difficult to identify any pattern of sentencing: cf R v Blacklidge NSWCCA 12 December 1995 and R v Maguire NSWCCA 30 August 1995. On the other hand, while it is always necessary to have regard to the particular factual context in order to understand the human tragedy involved in any particular case, it is also not possible to overlook the circumstance that the offence involves the felonious taking of a human life and, as such, calls for a grave measure of criminal justice, that is, one commensurate to the objective and subjective circumstances of the case: R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397. 
     
      
    47 In support of the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive, the Applicant drew attention to a number of other cases involving manslaughter by criminal negligence, some of which involved negligence by carers (for example, Rogers v Stone and Dobinson (supra), Regina v Eriksson (2001) NSWSC 781, R v Wilkinson (supra), and others, of which involved a wide variety of criminally reckless acts (for example, R v Cameron NSWCCA 27 September 1994, R v Do [2000] NSWCCA 459, R v Do [2001] NSWCCA 19 and R v Luong [2000] NSWSC 505). 
     
      
    48 We are unable to gain any meaningful assistance from a reference to these cases. It is necessary to restate that the practice, which appears to have developed in recent times, of approaching sentence appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor justified by authority: see Regina v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368; Regina v Salameh NSWCCA 9 June 1994 and Regina v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43 per Barr J at 98 to 101. At the most, other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing, which in the case of manslaughter is wider than for any other offence.  
     
      
    49 The difference in objective and subjective culpability, which is found in these decisions, is such that any search for a correlation between the case at hand and another decided case is to ignore the judicial discretion which is involved in the individual sentencing exercise required. As Barr J said in Trevenna, “Even if were possible to say that the culpability in two unrelated cases was the same it would not be correct to say, if the sentences were different, that for that reason alone one of them must be wrong.” Inter alia any such approach would have to assume that the other was correct, and that is an assumption which cannot logically be made.  
     
      
    50 These principles have a particular relevance for a case such as the present where the personal circumstances of those involved were wholly exceptional.  
     
      
    51 We would not interfere with his Honour’s finding as to special circumstances, but we are otherwise satisfied that, upon the particular facts of this case, the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    52 We accordingly make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed, sentence below quashed, and in lieu thereof Applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months, to date from 28 November 2002, and to expire on 27 May 2006; 
       
       
      3. A non-parole period of 2 years, to date from 28 November 2002, and to expire on 27 November 2004.

      JUDGMENT - on admissibility of identification evidence re witness Mostyn; see p 505 of transcript 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The next witness proposed to be called by the Crown is John Mostyn, who was at 4 January 2002 another prisoner at Parklea Correctional Centre. On 9 August 2002, he answered questions at the Crime Commission and described various events and persons that he saw and was then shown somewhere between six and twelve photographs, possibly seven, all of which, with one exception, had numbers appearing on their face.2 He identified a photo of the Accused Derbas as the person he had previously referred to in his evidence to the Crime Commission as looking like an Islander, and he identified the unnumbered photograph, which was a photo of the Accused Cheikho, as the person he had previously referred to in his evidence as ""Shaker"". Later that day, he made a statement to the police repeating what he had said to the Crime Commission and including the fact that he had been shown the photographs and had ""identified"" the persons in them in the manner I have said.3 Objection is taken to the evidence of his being shown the photographs and what he said about them to the Crime Commission and to his later identification of the same photographs to the police. The Crown, as I understand it, does not press the identification of the photographs to the police as evidence of identification of either of the two accused to whom I have referred, but merely as identifying the photographs which he had previously been shown by the Crime Commission, so the issue is whether evidence can or should be given of what he said and indicated when he was first shown the photographs.4 It is submitted that the evidence does not comply with s 115 of the Evidence Act and, alternatively, that it should be excluded as carrying the risk of unfair prejudice within the meaning of s 137 of that Act. Identification evidence is defined in the Dictionary to the Act, and one then turns to ss 114 and 115. Section 115(1) defines ""picture identification evidence"" as being identification evidence relating to an identification made wholly or partly by the person who made the identification examining pictures kept for the use of police officers, and the succeeding subsections of the section make it clear that what is being referred to is identification to police of photographs shown to the prospective witness by police. These photos were not shown to the witness by police and what was shown were not apparently pictures kept for the use of police officers. Accordingly, s 115 does not apply to this evidence.5 When one turns to s 114, ""visual identification evidence"" is defined as meaning identification evidence relating to an identification based wholly or partly on what a person saw but does not include picture identification evidence (my underlining).6 The first question which therefore arises is whether the process that took place was picture identification evidence. In my view, it clearly was picture identification evidence because it was identification from the process of being shown pictures. It was not picture identification evidence within the meaning of s 115, but the definition of ""picture identification evidence"" in s 115 is only a definition for the purposes of that section (see the first three words of subs (1) of that section).7 It follows that the definition in s 115 of ""picture identification evidence"" is not relevant to the construction of the same words in s 114(1) and, accordingly, the procedure was “picture identification evidence” for the purposes of s 114, and so is excluded from the definition of ""visual identification evidence"" in s 114, and s 114 has no application and the evidence is admissible.8 However, if I am wrong in this conclusion, in the case of the Accused Derbas, he had been offered an identification parade and refused to take part in such a parade. The evidence to this effect comes from the electronically recorded interview, a transcript of which is Exhibit C on the voir dire. He was asked, Question 20, ""...do you agree to taking part in an identification parade"", and his answer was ""no comment"". It can be argued that this was not an express refusal, but in the context where he had been warned he was not required to answer questions and answered ""no comment"" to a large number of questions, I construe his answer to that question as a refusal to take part in an identification parade.9 Mr Drake on his behalf has submitted that any refusal to take part in an identification parade occurred on 5 January 2002, the day after the death of Assad Barakat, but this photo identification procedure at the Crime Commission did not take place until 9 August 2002 and, accordingly, that he should have been again offered the chance of an identification parade. I see no reason why this should be so. He had been offered an identification parade shortly after the events in question. He had, as I have held, refused. There was no reason, in my view, why he needed to be offered another one. It may have been better if he had been, but if s 114 applied at all, I am satisfied its requirements had been met. I am, therefore, satisfied that the evidence of John Mostyn relating to the accused Derbas is admissible.10 Mr Drake then submits that it should be excluded pursuant to the provisions of s 137 of the Act on the grounds that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. He submits that there is no detailed evidence of the procedure that was followed. There is no evidence that Mr Tim O'Connor, the officer of the Crime Commission who conducted the questioning and showed the photographs, will give evidence, there is some doubt as to the precise number of photographs shown and no evidence of whether there was any evidence or direction given to the witness as to which photographs he should choose. He, accordingly, submits that the admission of the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to his client.11 There is some evidence as to how the photographic procedure occurred, and that is to be found in the evidence of Mr Mostyn in cross-examination at the committal where, having told the Commission what he had told them about what he claimed he had seen, he was asked, (p 44 of 5 November 2003), whether he could describe the persons referred to and he replied, ""Is there any photos and I will show you which ones."" He then identified the persons in the photos, as he described in paras 29 to 38 of his statement to the police of 9 August 2002.12 There are what might be called weaknesses in the procedure, but these are matters that can be explored in cross-examination. It is true he was only shown a small number of photographs, but this is a matter to which the jury's attention can be directed. The evidence has probative value as it purports to identify a person present at the time of the killing of the deceased. It is certainly prejudicial, but I am not satisfied that when the appropriate directions are given it will be unfairly prejudicial, in the sense that there is any danger that the jury may misuse the evidence.13 Sections 116 and 165(1)(b) require that extensive directions and warnings be given about the dangers of identification evidence and such warnings will be given at the appropriate time.14 Objection is also taken to similar evidence in relation to the Accused Cheikho. For the reasons already given, I am satisfied that s 114 does not apply, but if I am wrong, I am satisfied that there is a further reason it does not apply, because it is not strictly identification evidence but evidence of recognition by the witness in a photograph of a man previously known to him: compare R v Gee (2000) 113 A Crim R 376 at para [38]. In the earlier part of his statement, he described what he had seen the person known to him as Shaker doing, whom he described as being from the same yard, that is the units 1B/1D yard, and what he said when shown the photograph was merely an identification of the person whom he had previously known by the name ""Shaker"" and whom he had recognised playing the part he allegedly claimed he played on 4 January. I am satisfied, therefore, that the evidence in relation to Cheikho is admissible.15 Mr Simpson also submits this evidence should be excluded pursuant to s 137, and he takes the same points as Mr Drake in relation to the apparent weaknesses in the procedure and what has been described as ""the lack of transparency""; but he also makes two further objections in relation to the particular photograph. First of all, that it is smaller, that is the actual photograph is smaller than the other photographs which he was shown; and secondly, that it was unnumbered. These considerations would be of greater significance if he was being asked to identify a person not previously known to him, but as I have said this was an case of recognition rather than identification, and in fact the photo numbered 5, although not as wide, is no taller than the photo of the Accused Cheikho; and the fact that it was not numbered in the circumstances as described by the witness Mostyn in his evidence at the committal does not appear to have any significance, although once again these are matters that will properly be drawn to the jury's attention in counsel's address and in my summing-up when giving the necessary warnings concerning identification evidence.16 For these reasons, I am satisfied that the evidence of the witness Mostyn in relation to both Accused Derbas and Cheikho is admissible, and that it should not be excluded pursuant to s 137. I rule accordingly.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
    1 GROVE J: The court is in a position to give its judgments and we will proceed to do so. 
     
      
    2 This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Hock DCJ on 15 October 2003 in the Sydney District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a prohibited firearm for which the maximum prescribed penalty is imprisonment for fourteen years. Despite that prescription, such an offence is capable of being dealt with in the Local Court where a penalty ceiling (subject to exception) of two years’ imprisonment would apply. The offence may be prosecuted upon indictment upon election by the Director of Public Prosecutions. That happened in this case. 
     
      
    3 The applicant had been in custody awaiting sentence since 7 May 2003 and her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years and six months both commencing on that date. Thus his first date of eligibility for parole became 6 November 2005. 
     
      
    4 The prosecution evidence was presented by way of an agreed statement of facts together with transcripts of three intercepted telephone calls. The statement of facts revealed that during 2002-2003 a combined operation of the Australian Crime Commission and the New South Wales Police Force investigated the supply of illegal firearms in this State. Consequently an undercover operative, whom I will refer to as “Constable Doe” negotiated the purchase of two Cobray sub-machine guns from a man named Kucuk. On 23 January 2003, while these two men were at Kucuk’s residence, one such weapon was delivered there by a third man named Elrich. After that delivery Elrich left the premises. The participation of the applicant was detailed in the statement of facts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “A short time later Elrich returned to Kucuk’s residence accompanied by Harkan Goktas. Goktas and Elrich arrived in a silver coloured Daewoo motorcar, New South Wales registration AND 46R registered to Goktas’s mother. 
        
       
       
        
        A black and orange coloured toolbox was removed from the car and taken into Kucuk’s house.  
        
       
       
        
        Following introductions with the operative, the toolbox was opened and a ‘Cobray’ sub-machine gun was removed. This weapon was given to the operative. Goktas told the operative he could supply multiple ammunition magazines for the weapon if the operative desired.” 
        
       
      
    5 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. In a written submission to this court the Crown Prosecutor stated that there was a dispute on the facts as to whether the applicant had carried the toolbox containing the weapon into the house. There is no such allegation in the statement of facts. Nor was such a proposition advanced to the applicant when he was cross examined. The written submissions refer to such an allegation being made in separate proceedings against Elrich but there is neither evidence nor suggestion in the present case that the applicant had handled the box containing the weapon. Nor is there any suggestion that the applicant was involved in the delivery of the first weapon. 
     
      
    6 The Cobray sub-machine gun is a small, readily concealable weapon with a magazine capacity of thirty rounds which can be discharged in less than two seconds. It is a prohibited firearm in this State. Constable Doe paid $35,000 for the two weapons. The applicant was not charged with being involved in the sale of either weapon (in distinction from Elrich and Kucuk who have been so charged), and it is expressly submitted that “the Crown did not, and does not, rely on the fact of the sale as constituting an aggravating factor” (in the case of the applicant). 
     
      
    7 The applicant gave evidence that he had known Elrich since they had been in kindergarten. On the day in question he received a telephone call from him saying that his car had broken down and that he “needed a ride”. The applicant brought the car to Elrich’s house and Elrich loaded the toolbox into it and drove to Kucuk’s house. The applicant said that he permitted Elrich to drive his car because he complained about his driving. It might be observed that the applicant was charged on 10 December 2002 with two counts of driving whilst suspended. On 3 February 2003 he received fines for those offences and was disqualified for a total of three years. 
     
      
    8 The applicant testified that the toolbox was not open and that he did not know what was inside it when Elrich brought it to the vehicle. He was not cross-examined about these assertions. Once inside the house, however, the toolbox was opened and the weapon produced and he saw it taken out and handed out to Constable Doe. He testified that he heard some discussion about that and other weapons and he continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Then I jumped aboard, jumped on the bandwagon and said ‘Yeah, I could get you magazines if you need something’.” 
        
       
      
    9 The applicant described himself as “big noting” and asserted that he could not in fact fulfil any such request. Again, he was not cross-examined about these assertions. The Crown presented no elaboration of what I have recorded being said to Constable Doe. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was not a participant in any of the telephone conversations which were intercepted. The intercepted service was a mobile phone operated by Kucuk. On two of the occasions Kucuk was speaking to Elrich and the conversation supports the proposition that Elrich was waiting for someone to give him a lift to Kucuk’s house. This is consistent with the evidence of the applicant. The third conversation was between Kucuk and Constable Doe. 
     
      
    11 The proceedings including the evidence of the applicant were heard on 10 October 2003 and the applicant was remanded for sentence to 15 October. On that occasion the learned presiding judge pointed out that she had overlooked formally asking the applicant whether he adhered to the plea of guilty which he had tendered in the Local Court, but she raised with counsel a proposition that, if she accepted the evidence given on oath, the applicant would not be in possession of the weapon. Counsel responded that the basis of making the plea was: 
     
      
       
        
        “His oral participation in the sale which inferred joint possession with Bassam Elrich in order for the sale to proceed.” 
        
       
      
    12 Her Honour indicated that it was her view that the applicant was in joint possession of the weapon from the time Mr Elrich picked him up. She explained that she did not believe that he did not know that the gun was in the toolbox and she gave the applicant the opportunity to consider his position. The applicant then adhered to his plea as he does before this court. 
     
      
    13 Her Honour dealt with the relevant circumstances in these terms in her remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender gave evidence during which he denied that he knew of the presence of the gun until he was inside the house, and that he then big noted himself by saying he could get ammunition for it. I do not accept his explanation in the light of his plea of guilty. I am satisfied that the offender was in possession of the weapon with Elrich from the time he picked the latter up. He must have known that the gun was to be supplied to the undercover officer as evidenced by his offering to supply ammunition for the weapon. He was prepared to involve himself in possession of a weapon for which there is absolutely no legitimate purpose. The possession of such a weapon, even for the short period of time encompassed by this offence, represents criminal conduct of a very high order.” 
         
        
       
      
    14 I note in passing that the statement of facts refers to ammunition magazines, as distinct from supplying ammunition as her Honour found. 
     
      
    15 The evidence was that the journey from Elrich’s house to Kucuk’s house took only a few minutes. Her Honour made no finding as to whether the applicant could have in fact fulfilled any offer to supply ammunition (or magazines) for the weapon, and it is not clear to me why it should follow that an offer to supply ammunition (or magazines) made when the weapon was produced in Kucuk’s house demonstrates that the applicant must have known that there was a weapon in the toolbox earlier when Elrich brought it into the vehicle. 
     
      
    16 At the time when the applicant appeared for sentence neither Elrich nor Kucuk had been dealt with but, as I have mentioned, they were both charged with offences including participation in the sale of weapons. Elrich has since been dealt with on two counts of knowingly taking part in the sale of prohibited firearms, for which maximum penalty of twenty years’ imprisonment is prescribed. He was sentenced to a total of six years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of three and a half years. Elrich had a prior conviction for carrying an unlicensed firearm and for using a firearm with disregard for public safety. He also had convictions for robbery and assault. 
     
      
    17 The applicant’s evidence was that he had substantially engaged himself in conversation about boxing with Constable Doe whilst at Kucuk’s house. The applicant is a boxer who has appeared in bouts broadcast on a cable television network. He had recently fought such a bout at the time. It was in the course of this conversation that he conceded he made the “big noting” statement about capacity to supply ammunition magazines.  
     
      
    18 Her Honour noted that the applicant had been born on 5 July 1972 and that his record could effectively be compartmentalised. He was dealt with for offences in the Children’s Court and thereafter between 1991 and 1993 he was convicted of a number of assaults for some of which he served imprisonment. In 1993 his convictions ceased. There was no further conviction except the driving matters which I have mentioned. The period of ten years without offending would seem to coincide with a marriage which ended in divorce. At the time he appeared for sentence he had commenced a new relationship and there was a child due to be born the month after he appeared for sentence. 
     
      
    19 Senior counsel for the applicant has argued a number of grounds. Having regard to the conclusion which I have reached, it will suffice to make only brief reference to some of them.  
     
      
    20 On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the sentencing process miscarried because a Probation and Parole report tendered to her Honour had recorded that the applicant was ineligible for periodic detention but this would seem to be inaccurate. In my view this is an irrelevant matter as some full time custodial sentence was inevitable. 
     
      
    21 It was further submitted that there was no proper medical or other evidence before the sentencing judge concerning the applicant’s mental condition. The Probation and Parole report made reference to depression suffered by the applicant in the past and some treatment that he had had years ago in a psychiatric centre. This argument is not now pressed except in the sense a report of Dr Westmore has been tendered to be taken into account in the event the court comes to the question of re-sentence. The report indicates that any condition which the applicant has is now in remission and his prospects of rehabilitation generally look promising. 
     
      
    22 I would reject the submission that there was error in her Honour’s failing to approach the matter as if the maximum sentence in the Local Court was notionally applicable. An appropriate sentence in this case, whether below or over that notional maximum, will be determined by assessment in accordance with appropriate principle, not by reference to that maximum. 
     
      
    23 I am, however, of the view that the evidence did not support her Honour’s finding that the applicant was in possession of the weapon before the toolbox was opened inside Kucuk’s house. That was when the evidence shows he acquired what would be the necessary knowledge. I have already made reference to the difficulty of reasoning to a conclusion of earlier possession from the statement at a later time that ammunition magazines could be supplied in the future. It was specifically put to her Honour that there was no evidence to support the view that the applicant knew that there was a gun until he got inside the house and, in an exchange, her Honour had indicated that she “understood” that. However, she said that she disbelieved the evidence that “when he suddenly sees the gun he then offers to provide ammunition” and counsel indicated that he could not “argue with you”. I have already cited the relevant passage of her Honour’s remarks. 
     
      
    24 On the facts asserted in the statement tendered by the Crown, the applicant was in joint possession of the weapon, without being involved in the sale, for a period which extended only for a matter of minutes. Constable Doe had a taxi waiting and left the premises with the weapons shortly after taking delivery. Even if one were to hypothesise the joint possession commencing at Elrich’s house, as her Honour did, it adds little to the span of time. 
     
      
    25 The statistics available from the Judicial Commission show that in respect of offenders dealt with other than in the Local Court forty-eight per cent were sentenced to imprisonment, sixty-three per cent received a sentence of two years or less, thirteen per cent received a sentence of more than three years and the longest non-parole period was eighteen months. The survey involved twenty-three offenders. 
     
      
    26 Paying particular regard to the very short period of the applicant’s possession, its joint nature, the circumstances of his participation and guided by those available statistics, I have reached the conclusion that this sentence is excessive to the level that this court should intervene. 
     
      
    27 The sentence imposed at first instance had been reached after her Honour applied a “discount” of twenty-five per cent to reflect the applicant’s plea of guilty which the Crown expressly conceded had been offered at the earliest opportunity. Her Honour assigned this to the “utilitarian” value of the plea and added that there was “little other evidence of remorse”. Her language suggests that she may have injected consideration of the latter into the former but as, in my opinion, there should be re-sentence, the matter need not be explored. 
     
      
    28 The applicant has been in custody for over fifteen months to the present time. In my view a sentence of two years’ imprisonment should be substituted and, for reasons coordinate with those found by her Honour, I would vary the proportion specified in the statute in the applicant’s favour when setting a non-parole period. Having regard to the time served, I would regard the point of release on parole to have been effectively reached. Some evidence has been tendered today which, as I have said, in addition to the evidence of Dr Westmore, gives promise of progress towards rehabilitation. 
     
      
    29 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (2) Appeal allowed. 
       
      (3) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to two years’ imprisonment to date from 7 May 2003 with a non-parole period of fifteen months twenty days commencing on 7 May 2003 and expiring on 26 August 2004. 
       
      (4) Order the applicant to be released to parole on Thursday 26 August 2004. 
      
    30 SULLY J: I agree with Mr Justice Grove. 
     
      
    31 KIRBY J: Whilst I agree with the order proposed, I differ to some degree in my analysis of the facts. 
     
      
    32 Mr Justice Grove has set out the agreed statement of facts which was tendered by the Crown. That statement of facts was to be understood in the context of the definition of ""possession"" of a firearm, and proof of possession, which appears in s 4A of the Firearms Act 1996. 
     
      
    33 In the proceedings on sentence the applicant gave evidence. He described the arrangement he made with Bassam Elrich. He suggested that Elrich was the source of the weapon. According to his testimony Elrich carried the toolbox (which he later learned contained the weapon) to the vehicle. He said that he had no knowledge of the presence of that weapon in the toolbox until he arrived at the premises and the toolbox was opened. 
     
      
    34 Her Honour rejected that account, at least so far as the time at which he became aware of the weapon. She did so even though it had not been the subject of cross-examination by the Crown. It was open for her to do so. Having rejected that version, it is not, in my view, appropriate to limit the time span of Mr Goktas’s possession. Her Honour simply knew, in terms of his criminality, that he had pleaded guilty to the offence. He had acknowledged being in possession of the prohibited weapon in the circumstances described in the statement of facts. His criminality was to be judged accordingly, neither enlarged by adverse assumptions as to his role, or the length of time he was in possession before the events described in the statement of facts, nor confined by favourable assumptions which had not been established to her Honour’s satisfaction on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
    35 With that qualification, I agree with the orders proposed. 
     
      
    36 GROVE J: The orders, therefore, will be as I have proposed.
